Closer (Feat. Halsey),"244,437",The Chainsmokers,"Hey I was doing just fine
before I met you
I drank too much and
that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey you tell your friends
it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city
in a broke down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty
in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer
in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as the good
as the day as I met you
I forget just why I left you
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tuscon okay
I know it breaks your heart
I moved to the city
in a broke down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty
in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer
in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So baby pull me closer
in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older
no we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
no we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
no we ain't ever getting older

Faded,"181,014",Alan Walker,"You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
These shallow waters never met
What I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monster running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded"
The Nights,"78,367",Avicii,"Hey
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside
came out to play
Hey
When face to face
with all our fears
Learned our lessons
through the tears
Made memories we knew
would never fade
One day my father he told me
Son don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms
I heard him say
Hey
When you get older
Your wild life will live
for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said One day you'll
leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me
when I was just a child
These are the nights
that never die
My father told me
When thunder clouds
start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve their name
into those shinning stars
He said Go adventure far
beyond these shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home
no matter where you are
One day my father he told me
Son don't let this slip away
When I was just a kid
I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild life will live
for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said One day
you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me
when I was just a child
These are the nights
that never die
My father told me
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
My father told me"
On My Way (배틀그라운드 모바일 배경음악),"130,882",Alan Walker,"I'm sorry but
Don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go
It's nothing personal
I draw the blinds
They don't need to see my cry
'Cause even if they understand
They don't understand
So then when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business
and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery
Making my bitch
can't be everyone's favorite girl
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No nobody but me
can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No nobody but me
can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Ya ya
Farru yeah guaya
Lo siento mucho Farru
pero me voy Eh
Porque a tu lado me
di cuenta que nada soy Eh-ey
Y me canse de luchar
y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la linea
de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errore'
tambien soy humano
Y tu no ve' que lo hago
porque te amo Pum-pum-pum-pum
Pero ya Ya no tengo
mas na' que hacer aqui Aqui
Me voy llego la hora 'e partir Partir
De mi propio camino
seguir lejos de ti
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
Is on the rise na-na
The fire burning in my eyes

"All Falls Down (Feat. Noah Cyrus, Digital Farm Animals)","148,802",Alan Walker,"What's the trick I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
all the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look at you
and I run right back to you
You crossed the line and
it's time to say F you
What's the point in saying that
when you know how I'll react
You think you can just take it back
but shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you
and that's that
'Cause when it all falls down
then whatever
When it don't work out
for the better
If we just ain't right
and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
when it all falls down
I'll be fine I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
but I'll be fine
Why we fight I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh I tried staying cold
but you take it personal
All these firing shots and
making grounder
It's way too hard to cope
but I still can't let you go
'Cause when it all falls down
then whatever
When it don't work out
for the better
If we just ain't right

When it all falls down

Something Just Like This,"188,639",The Chainsmokers,"I've been reading books of old

Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists

myself upon that list

How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind
of person that it fits
She said Where'd you wanna go
How much you wanna risk

I won big the day
I came across you
‘Cause when you're with me
I don't feel blue

it just felt right
It's like I met a copy
of myself that night
I don't believe in fate and such
But we were meant to be
together that's my hunch
Everybody wants true love
It's out there
if you look hard enough
enough enough
You'll always be my Day 1
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself
you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1
Hour by hour

I would never leave you
on your own
I just want you to know

Waiting For Love,"43,749",Avicii,"Where there's a will
there's a way kind of beautiful
And every night has its day
so magical
And if there's love in this life
there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear
for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones
of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream
we're unstoppable
With something to believe in
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love
waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire
gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't
be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
waiting for love
To come around
We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life
we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love
waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday

wild on Saturday

Keep me
Company in the night

With arms around me
Like a border
Like the air I breathe
I let you in
Keep me warm underneath my skin
'Cause I'm
Giving in
To your touch
I can never get enough
Dive in deep
Into the ocean
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean
You can be my safety zone
Somewhere
I can go and feel unknown
That's all I need
All I want
Is to stay a little longer now
Arms around me like a border
Like an endless stream
You take me in
To a place that I've never been

Malibu Nights,"69,711",LANY,"There's no reason
there's no rhyme
I found myself blindsided by
A feeling that I've never known
I'm dealing with it on my own
Phone is quiet walls are bare
I drink myself to sleep who cares
No one even has to know
I'm dealing with it on my own
I've got way too much time
to be this hurt
Somebody help it's getting worse
What do you do
with a broken heart
Once the light fades
everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night
What do I do with all this time
Every thought when it gets late
Puts me in a fragile state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own
I'm praying but it's not enough
I'm done I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
Dealing with it on my own
I've got way too much time
to be this hurt
Somebody help it's getting worse
What do you do
with a broken heart
Once the light fades
everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night
What do I do with all this time
I drive circles
under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
get this out my head so
I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget
I've got way too much time
to be this hurt
Somebody help it's getting worse
What do you do
with a broken heart
Once the light fades
everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night
What do I do with all this time
I drive circles
under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
get this out my head so
I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget
get this out my head so
I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind"
Symphony (Feat. Zara Larsson),"98,025",Clean Bandit,"I’ve been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone
I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go
I’m sorry if it’s all too much
Every day you’re here I’m healing
And I was runnin' out of luck
I never thought I’d find this feeling

Can you hear me
as I scream your name

Do you need me

We live we love we lie
Deep in the dark
I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live we love we lie

Nice to meet your

And my heart is feeling vacant

in your heart
You're worth saving darling
But I don't know why you're shooting

I got faith in nothing
But love pray for me

So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be
My head is running miles
Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
너라는 집으로 지금 다시
way back home
세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해
오직 너로 완결된 이야기를
No I won't ever lose
As long as you're there
빛이 다 꺼진 여기
나를 안아줘
눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와
이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가

Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home"

But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance
to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay
forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up
when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

Still at my parents house
Thought I would have it figured out

one has a baby
I barely recognize this town
Mama asked me
what my plan is for the future
But I don't even know
what's going on for dinner
I'm 24 now,
thought I could finally settle down
Parties end before I'm drunk
Friday night I'm tired as fuck
I don't know how I ended up like this
Can someone tell me
what the hell I missed? (Missed, yeah)
Birthday's here, I'm still depressed
Got no friends, just lots of stress It
feels like yesterday
when we were kids
Can someone tell me
what the hell I missed?
'Cause I don't know
Sleep till the sun's down,
another breakdown
Feels like the days are all the same
New type of anxious,
school never taught this
And what the fuck are taxes anyway?
I tell myself
I won't be cynical and bitter
And now I see it
when I'm looking in the mirror
I'm 24 now,
wondering when I will be okay
Parties end before I'm drunk
Friday night I'm tired as fuck

We still know what truly matters
Keeping hope alive

And walking on cold thin ice

and she awoke again
Then she ran faster than
Start screaming

When you see your reflection
you'll see what I like
You look good in the morning
And you don't even know it
I knew that
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought
that she could be the one
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought
that she could be the one
Sundress with you on my arm
Take the coupe out the garage
Pull the roof back just me
you and the stars
Toast to the Gods
She's the one a masterpiece
She a drug got a fast release
Got me sprung wrapped in sheets
Wake up fuck
and then we going back to sleep
Me and you on an island
With the ocean color stuck
in your iris
We're comfortable in silence
But I prefer when we wilding
Sundress nothing underneath
as we undress
You could look in my eyes see
I'm some mess
Couple of broken people
Trying to complete each other
Under one breath
Don't look in the mirror
look into my eyes
When you see your reflection
you'll see what I like
You look good in the morning
And you don't even know it
I knew that
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought
that she could be the one
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought
that she could be the one
She could be the one"
Lovesick,"5,255",Alan Walker,"Every night before I sleep
I pray that you will come to me
A million, million miles away
We'll meet again someday
I know that we'll find a way
We'll sing a bitter melody
And add a sweeter harmony
A symphony we'll make
So sing for all the tears we cry
A song for when we say goodbye
Then every time we close our eyes
We'll hear our lovesick lullaby
I remember what you said
I got you stuck in my head
Did you think I would forget
The melodies you sang?
Oh when you move me
like nobody moves me
You're playing my heart stings
Like la da di da da
So sing for all the tears we cry
A song for when we say goodbye
Then every time we close our eyes
We'll hear our lovesick lullaby
La la-la la-la la-la-la
La la la la
La la-la la-la la-la-la

There For You,"75,500",Martin Garrix,"I woke up pissed off today
And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side
So when your tears roll down
your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming
but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too
Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side
So when your tears roll down
your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming
but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you
I got you I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down
your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too
But I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you feel nothing
I'm running running
just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running running
just to keep my hands on you
Running running
just to keep my hands on you
Running running
just to keep my hands on you
So I'm running running
just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too"

We'll live on the dark side

As black as diamonds
We're running out of time
Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies
Believe it I see it
I know that you can feel it
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

My heart is closed by duel
Will I learn to love again?
Who will walk with me in the rain?
Please remember our summers
Come the sun
Come the rain
And the leaves falling
I will wait even if the seasons change
Anxiety runs through my veins
I'll escape from all these chains
Say ""come back"", in all the possible ways
I don't want you to get lost
Will we ever meet again?

Please remember our summers
My heart is closed by duel
Will I learn to love again?
Who will walk with me in the rain?

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone
I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go

I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here I'm healing
And I was runnin' out of luck

Friendships (Lost My Love) (Feat. Leony),"9,493",Pascal Letoublon,"You left a mark in my mind
that I never could erase
Took a piece from my heart
that nobody could replace
Nobody could replace you
You are the eye in the storm,
you're the piece I try to find
When I'm out in the cold,
you're the one that's on my mind
Will search until I find you
I lost my love to you
I lost my love to you
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
Was hoping that you knew
(Na-na-na-na)
Don't know what else to do
(Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you
I've been alone in my dreams,
but I've always searched for you
Needed love in this place,
you're the only one I knew
The only one to fix me
Carried away by the wind,
hope it takes me in your arms
Only place where I'm safe,
only you can heal my scars
The only one to save me
I'm on my way over the deep blue sea
I'll be searching for your light
house to lead me
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
Was hoping that you knew
(Na-na-na-na)
Don't know what else to do
(Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you
I lost my love
(Was hoping that you knew)
Oh-oh-oh (Don't know what else to do)
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you
I lost my love to you"

Jiggle Jiggle

[Chorus]
My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

[Verse]
Shephard's bush, my compact push
Notting Hill Gate, my Fiat skate
With a crate of Cabernet, but not today
Because I gotta drive, I wanna stay alive
Not 'cause it's illicit, do I have to get explicit?
As a matter of fact, I sip on the yak
With Big and Reece, 200 diamonds in thеir piece
I'm trying to get minе, so I can shine


[Interlude]
Jiggle jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle
Jiggle jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle

[Chorus]
My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

[Outro]
I think that went really well, don't you?
I enjoyed it, nice being in the booth
So, unless you have anything else, that's a wrap
Jiggle jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle
Jiggle jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle"

Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Remember me no time cannot erase
I can't hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby

I recognize you,
there is something in your eyes
Won't let you get away tonight
You leave me in the dark
I'm stumbling around like
I'm a question mark
Wondering if you're around
to catch me if I fall
If I come crashing to the wall
Will you light me up,
jumpstart my heart?
I need someone
before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
I can't breathe
Hoping you're here to rescue me
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
Been here before
It's in my muscle memory,
I'm pretty sure
I've felt this energy,
there's something in your touch
Something reminded me of us
Will you light me up,
jumpstart my heart?
I need someone
before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
I can't breathe
Hoping you're here to rescue me
Before the sun goes down
Who's gonna save me now?
Some kind of hero
Some kind of hero

Run Free (feat. IVIE),"11,796",Deep Chills,"I still remember
Loving the danger
You set me on fire
When I'm by your side
You taking me higher
I follow you down if we go down
Now you say you wanna get away
You wanna take me all the way
Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun I want yah
We can burn together
Fading into one another
Ohh
Well don't you know
You're still heaven to me
Baby we could run free
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
My deepest of secrets
Trust you to keep 'em
Hiding the worlds
You cannot say
I got what you wanted
I got what you needed
It's all in the way
That you say my name
Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun I want yah
We can burn together
Fading into one another
Ohh
Well don't you know
You're still heaven to me
Baby we could run free
If you do it just the way I like

Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones

Stone hard, as bulletproof glass

Crying Over You ◐,"22,637",HONNE,"You don't mean to be a problem
You don't mean to cause me pain
You don't mean to do much but
it's one and the same
I don't know where this came from
I thought we were plain sailing
This has taken me aback and it
it goes without saying
Yeah I'm gonna feel
broken for a bit
Life's gonna be a little bit shit
Oh for at least the next week
We had our flaws I'll be
the first to admit
And we both struggled to commit
Oh was it really that bleak
And I don't know
why I've been crying over you
For the life of me
I wish that I knew
And I don't know
just how much more
I can go through
Man oh man I wish I knew
why I've been crying over you
I don't mean to be a problem
I don't mean to cause you pain
Don't wanna break it up but
there's no other way
You're not the only one
who's hurting
Or who's finding this hard
But you gotta admit
that we're drifting apart
Look we're gonna feel broken a bit
And it's gonna be a little bit shit
But you'll find the strength
when you're weak
You'll find a love
when you least expect it
It could be any minute
So don't fight the
tears on your cheek
And I don't know
why I've been crying over you
For the life of me I wish that I knew
And I don't know
just how much more I can go through
Man oh man I wish I knew
why I've been crying over you
I don't mean to be a problem
why I've been crying over you
I don't mean to cause you pain
why I've been crying over you
You're not the only one hurting
And though I can't say when
I know love will find its way again
way again
And I don't know
why I've been crying over you
For the life of me
I wish that I knew
And I don't know
just how much more
I can go through
Man oh man I wish I knew

Where are you now

The monster's running

Honestly you probably shouldn't
Listen to a word I say
Cause girl I feel like
I've been dizzy for days
Would you do it if I asked you to stay
Or would you tell me
it's a little too late
Cause if it is I'd be happy to fade
Said I'd pick a better time
and a place
But if it's not
and you still got monsters
My demons would be happy to play
Just look at everyone's faces
Y'know that they faded
Always escaping
I did too much taking
Now when you say shit
It feels it's nothin' like
When I had you girl
At least I had somethin' right
Deep like de ocean
Seizing the moment
My cards are showing
Where are you now
Atlantis under the sea
under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monster's running
wild inside of me
I'm faded I'm faded
So lost I'm faded I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
And I don't mean to
put on the pressure
But if you ever wanna
do it to me again
I probably would let ya
And I know it's a little bit extra
To say that I'm messed up's
An understatement
It's time that I let go
I'm done with hatin'
I hear music having me blasting
Life is steadily passing
And baby I'm not exaggerated
So imma keep deep diving
Just to see where you hidin'
And if you aren't in the sea
I just wait until I dream
To see if I can find you
Where are you now
Atlantis under the sea
under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monster's running
wild inside of me
I'm faded I'm faded
So lost I'm faded I'm faded
So lost I'm faded"

Both hands on the sink
I'm holding tight
Why are you still glued
in my mind
Silly little me can't win
this fight
Even though I know
that you were far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catchin' these feelings
holdin' on to the pieces
It's hittin' me hard now that I'm
Dancing with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh I hate the things
you're makin' me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searching for you in someone else
But I can't help myself I do
Somebody like you
Looking for your Prius
in the parking lot
I know it's not there
but it's all I got
Rain is pouring down
drowning my thoughts
I guess you've found yourself
another spot
Even though I know
that you were far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catchin' these feelings
holdin' on to the pieces
It's hittin' me hard now that I'm
Dancing with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh I hate the things
you're makin' me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searching for you in someone else
But I can't help myself I do

Somebody like you

I've got no destination
And I'm sipping on my tea
I've got all day long
Just to walk down the street
I start on Second Avenue
Making my way downtown to you
Maybe I'll make a stop
at Bang Bang
Get myself a new tattoo
Then I find me a secret garden
And I sit down with my book
But I'm not planning on reading
I'm just here to have a look
At people in and out of stores
Maybe she's an entrepreneur
Maybe he just got off a tour
The many characters

With the best smile I've ever seen
I put my book away
And walk over to him
in my blue jeans
We start to talk about something
Then I suggest we get a drink
Let's bike over the bridge
to Brooklyn
You tell me what do you think
And so we head to Miss Favela
For the live music at three
And we're dancing on the pavement
Just like everybody
We dance until we hit the floor
I think we should
head out the door

with friends for more

Now we head back to Manhattan
We've picked up a friend or two
Maybe this morning
we were strangers
But not by this afternoon
We hang until the sun comes up
End up on somebody's rooftop
Go to the Box and have a ball
At six or seven different clubs
And now I'm walking home
through Chinatown
And I pass Chrystie street
Reminisce about the studio
Where The Knocks and we would meet
I know it changes but of course

Scattered us like leaves

The song that never leaves

what we could be

Baby if I could tell you
if I could tell you
How much I care
I'm in despair
Are you still there
Just tell me
Just tell me
how we can make this work
How we can make this work
'Cuz baby if I find a way
I'm sure of it this love won't stray
Just give me a chance to say
I love you
And I need you
Now are you here to stay
Or fade away like every other day
You're the reason that I lie awake
Baby it's 3 00 a.m.

Make a run for it come on
Go
These are the moments I cherish
Us hiding from the rain
Stay by your side till I perish
I know you’d do the same
I never knew that
this could feel so good
These are the moments I cherish
You kissing me goodnight
Everything else seems to vanish
When I’m lying by your side
I never knew that this
could feel so good
At last a love that feels
just like it should
This feels so good
feels so good
You got me in the mood for love
I don’t know your horoscope
But I know that you keep me close
‘cause this feels so good
so good so good
With you it all makes sense
What would I do if you were gone
‘cause you always
finish my sentence
I know you more than anyone
I never knew that
this could feel so good
At last a love that
feels just like it should
This feels so good
feels so good
You got me in the mood for love
I don't know your horoscope
But I know that you keep me close
‘cause this feels so good

Stranger Things (Alan Walker Remix) (Feat. OneRepublic),"11,443",Kygo,"Castles glitter under
Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out
for you tonight
We used to run around
this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out
I remember
We dream of places
that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something
beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now
Castles glitter under
Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out
for you tonight
Snow white mountains
in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it
We turned our back on
ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something
beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down
Castles glitter under
Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out
for you tonight
Snow white mountains
in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday

coming back for more
Is it just our bodies
Are we both losing our minds
Is the only reason

Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright

spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

Make it count, don't hold onto the past
And we could light up the sky of tomorrow

San Francisco (feat. Sofia Carson),"23,071",Galantis,"I met you in a bar
in San Francisco
Said you used to have a car
before the repo
Smoking Lucky cigarettes
I think the smoke
went to my head
And now that summer night
plays on repeat
We climbed the Golden Gate bridge
just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder
song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say
it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget
San Francisco
No I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget that
night in San Francisco
In San Francisco
In San Francisco
I met you in a bar
in San Francisco
But when the sun came up
we had to let go
When you took that Greyhound bus
Thought it was the end of us
But now
you're all I dream of when I sleep
We climbed the Golden Gate bridge
just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder
song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say
it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget

No I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget that

Ignite (Feat. Seungri),"12,098",K-391,"Fireflies a million little pieces
Feeds the dying light
and breathes me back to life
In your eyes
I see something to believe in
Your hands are like a flame
Your palms the sweetest pain
Let the darkness lead us
into the light
Let our dreams get lost
feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more
beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding
into the night
You and I get lost
in the infinite lights
Baby tell me one more
beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
So alive your touch
is like the daylight
Burning on my skin
it turns me on again
You and I
survivors of the same kind
And we're the only ones
Dancing on the sun
Let the darkness lead us
into the light
Let our dreams get lost
feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more
beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding
into the night
You and I get lost
in the infinite lights
Baby tell me one more
beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
Diamonds are forever
but all we need is just tonight
We're monumental tremors
that can freeze the speed of life
Just like particles
that's falling from heaven
all over the stars
Hear you calling for me
Hear you calling me on from afar
Let the darkness lead us
into the light
Let our dreams get lost
feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more
beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
I feel the heat as we collide
Like a fever that feels so right
So baby tell me one more

One touch and I ignite

Polaroid,"10,331",Jonas Blue,"Let me tell you how it happened
I wasn't looking
for someone that night
Now I was never a believer
That you could fall in love
at the first sight
But all of a sudden
We loved and got lost
in the moment
All of a sudden
She's gone in the flash
of a light
I never was looking hmm
I'll be looking
for the rest of my life
We took a Polaroid
You signed your name upon it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a Polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it starts fading
Was it my imagination
I could've swore
I saw someone like you
A thousand people at the station
In a second you slipped
out of view
Then all of a sudden
I loved and got lost
in the moment
All of a sudden
She's gone in the blink
of an eye
I never was looking hmm
I'll been looking
for the rest of my life
We took a Polaroid
You signed your name upon it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a Polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it starts fading
We were dancing without moving
All my friends are
leaving me behind
I didn't wanna catch a feeling
But there was something
in that flashin' light
Then all of a sudden
I loved and got lost
in the moment
All of a sudden
She's gone in the blink
of an eye
I never was looking hmm
I've been looking

Whoa, oh
So far, so good
Mmm, oh, yep

[Chorus]
Why? You only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

[Verse 1]
Tell me that you're gonna change then act like this instead
I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends
I can't make you love me, but at least you could pretend
Scrips gonna lead to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head

[Pre-Chorus]
You play the same old songs
I know that you're different in your Air Force Ones
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue
Like I got an addiction, yeah
You always say that shit's gonna change, but it never does

Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

[Verse 2]
I know it's my fault, I pick up your phone calls
When it's half past one and you're halfway drunk
You say you love me and it sounds so dumb
But you're the only one I can't run away from

[Pre-Chorus]
The same old songs
I know that you're different in your Air Force Ones
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue
Like I got an addiction, yeah
You always say that shit's gonna change, but it never does

[Chorus]
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?

Somebody That I Used To Know (feat． Kimbra) (Feat. Kimbra),"18,144",Gotye,"Now and then I think of when we
were together
Like when you said you felt so
happy you could die
Told myself that you were right
for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an
ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a
certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the
end always the end
So when we found that we could
not make sense
Well you said that we would
still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad
that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your
records and then change your
nunmber
I guess that I don't need
that though
Now you're just somebody
that I used to know
Now you're just somebody
that I used to know
Now you're just somebody
that I used to know
Now you then I think of all the
times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was
always something that i'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up
on somebody that you used to Know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your
records and then change your
nunmber
I guess that I don't need
that though
Now you're just somebody

Now you're just somebody

Now you're just somebody

That I used to know

On My Way (Da Tweekaz Remix),"6,357",Alan Walker,"I'm sorry but
Don't wanna talk

I draw the blinds
They don't need to see me cry
Cause even if they understand
So then when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and
ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery
Make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No nobody but me can keep me safe

So Good (Alex Adair Remix),"14,182",Louisa,"I said I'm 'bout five minutes away
One more stop and
I'll be off this train
I'm free any day of the week
always losing some sleep
I told myself I'll be back by ten
Trying to save myself
for the weekend
But I know me I hate to miss a party
Don't say don't say I didn't warn you
Don't say I didn't warn you
I live for the moment
I wasn't supposed to go out tonight
I should be at home I got work at 9
Shouldn't be out
here doing what I like
But it feels so good so good
I was only gonna be an hour or two
I guess that now I'm here
I'm going down with you
But it feels so good so good
Angel on my shoulder's
giving up on me
No listening to him
and I can hardly speak
The music they play
makes me this way oh yeah
It was only 10 how did it get to 3
It's like I'm in my own time machine
But you know me I'll never leave
Don't say don't say I didn't warn you
Don't say I didn't warn you
Just live for the moment
I wasn't supposed to go out tonight
I should be at home I got work at 9
Shouldn't be out
here doing what I like
But it feels so good so good
I was only gonna be an hour or two
I guess that now I'm here
I'm going down with you
But it feels so good so good
'Cause everyone I know is here
Drinking sours crying tears
Living out the best years
So keep on toasting shots cheers
People know it feels
So good
I wasn't supposed to go out tonight
I should be at home baby
I wasn't supposed to go out tonight
I should be at home I got work at 9
Shouldn't be out
here doing what I like

I can't promise you

I'll leave anything behind

cigarettes and fast talking
I feel you slip away
I can't understand the reasons
why you say you're leaving

in love with me yesterday

Happy Now,"19,223",Zedd,"You're a world away

So won't you tell me babe
Are you happy now
You're the only one
who can up and run
Leave me just as empty
as the day you came
And you hold all the cards
all the broken hearts
Strung over your shoulder
till it's all in vain
And only you know the strength
in your teeth
The wash in the weight
of your pockets so deep
And lonely
You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me babe
Are you happy now
Are you happy now
You're the only one who can
In the palm of your hands
You can make me dance
Spin me around in circles
till I'm wrapped in string
You keep on talking sweet
till your fingers bleed
But don't you dare ask me
how I've been
Now only you know the strength
in your teeth
The wash in the weight
of your pockets so deep
And lonely
You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me babe

Something Just Like This (Alesso Remix),"12,105",The Chainsmokers,"I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself
upon that list
But she said where'd you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person
that it fits
She said where'd you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody

Run It,"12,007",Midnight Kids,"I remember when
in the summer winds
We would speed down
the 405 playing The Who
With the red lights
and adrenaline
We had young blood in our veins
and dirt on our shoes
But you sold that
car the year you finished school
And I stopped wearing
that faded pair of shoes
We got so wrapped up
in the clouds we fell through
Hey Hey Hey Oh
We just want to stay this young for
Everyday the bills keep coming
All the bullshit we’re all stuck in
Take me back to
when we’d just drive
Think it’s time that we said fuck it
Red light let’s run it
I'm sitting in line on the 405
When the same song
that we’d sing is playing outside
I got the windows up
but I can hear enough
For it to bring me
back to the way we loved
Feeling so big feeling
sober feeling alive
You sold that car the year
you finished school
And I stopped wearning that
faded pair of shoes
We got so wrapped up
in the clouds we fell through
Hey Hey Hey Oh
We just want to stay this young for
Everyday the bills keep coming
All the bullshit we’re all stuck in
Take me back to when we’d just drive
Think it’s time that we said fuck it

You had your heart set on me
But these feelings
they come and go
And they come so easily
Tell me what
It is about you that I can't forget
But you're breaking
down my walls again
Just to set me free
Why do I baby why do I
Love the way you
only always leave me
Why do I baby why do I
Love the touch
but never love the feeling
Why do I baby why do I
Love the way you
only always leave me
Why do I baby why do I
Love the touch
but never love the feeling
Staying up when I go out
You gotta know I'm all yours
But when I say
What's that about
You start slurring your words
Tell me why you have to seem
So distant when I'm holding you
Your fingertips are drifting away
And I f*cking love how it hurts
Why do I baby why do I
Love the way you
only always leave me
Why do I baby why do I
Love the touch
but never love the feeling
Why do I baby why do I
Love the way you
only always leave me
Why do I baby why do I
Love the touch

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love

And I cannot change you

I take prescriptions to
make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams
where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past
but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls
had the prettiest face
You gave me a heart
that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart
and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
I still see your shadows in my room

Another start you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight
Where are you now

Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now
Atlantis under the sea under the sea
Where are you now Another dream
The monster's running
wild inside of me
I'm faded I'm faded
So lost I'm faded I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
These shallow waters never met
what I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire

Tired (Feat. Gavin James),"15,596",Alan Walker,"I see those tears in your eyes

Just let me love you

Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what came by me
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

And it feels like you've
lost who you are

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you

when your heart is tired
When you whisper I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could they’d say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes

Don't see myself inside
Why can’t I get it right

Why do I feel so small

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside

Ooh
Tired of being afraid
But lately I've lost my faith
What is love without pain
it ain't home
You're watching me but I'm below
When I get caught I hope
This is kinda like how they will
Take me home
So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

Where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone
Who's gonna walk you

Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up
I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone

Make our hearts the only sound
Throw my fears all to the ground
Will you hold me
Will you serenade me
With the song you used to play
'Til the night turns into day
Will you hold me
'Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I'm so tired I can't even sleep
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby
Just the sound of your voice
is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby
I could fall for the sound
of your sweet melody
'Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along
When I'm not feeling
strong I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me
So sing to me
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me
I'll be there when you're down
'Cause forever I am bound
For my love I shout it out
Let me hold you
No journey is too far
For the one who healed my scars
You're my saviour you're my star
Let me hold you
'Cause all I need is somebody near me

It's our time to learn
yourself to praise you

And you make it right
You bring the balance to our lives

Hope life is beautiful
You were the life of me
to find my truth
I just wanna say thank you
Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
And I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come
back to these days

These days these days
Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty
when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk
remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty
when you're trying to move on

We'll sit down together

About these days these days

To these days these days
Cigarettes and the ash tray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you'd end up
with my last name
But that changed
And I traveled around the world
Think where you living at now
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think
I'd get you back right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark
I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come
back to these days these days
We'll wish we could come back
to these days these days"

Look at where we are
Is this what dreams are made of?

With my hands in the air, I'lI make enough
To always stay by your side
I will be there on your darkest nights
I'm here 'til the day that I die

I believe in love again



Tonight

You know that

You're gonna find

What you're looking for

You and I

To feel you're in a dancefloor

Baby, please

C'mon



When I'm uninspired

And I'm down and feeling low

You take me higher

There's no limit

To the places I can go

And when I dive into your river

Where the crystal waters flow

Oh yeah

That is the moment I'm delivered

Baby, never let me go

Don't let me go



I believe in love again

I believe in love again

Oh, oh-oh, oh

I believe in love again

I believe

I believe in love again

I believe in love again

I believe in

I believe in love again

I believe

I believe in love again

Ooh, ooh

I believe in love again

I believe

I believe in love again"
Monody (Radio Edit) (Feat. Laura Brehm),"10,947",TheFatRat,"here we stand open arms
This is home where we are
Ever strong in the world
that we made
I still hear you in the breeze
See your shadows in the trees
Holding on memories never change
Summer in the hills
Those hazy days I do remember
We were running still
Had the whole world at our feet
Watching seasons change
Our roads were lined
with adventure
Mountains in the way
Couldn't keep us from the sea
Here we stand open arms
This is home where we are
Ever strong in the world
that we made
I still hear you in the breeze
See your shadows in the trees
Holding on memories never change"

Matches,"19,384",Cash Cash,"I remember how we used to be
so beautiful
You broke my heart at 16
The first time I felt my world
come crashing
Black magic
like your heart was made of matches
And I never got over it
I swear your friends know
when to post your photograph
It doesn’t really hurt
but it always takes me back to 16
In your basement and your parents
my feelings
And I never got over it
How did you break my heart
without even trying
How are you on my mind
You're not even talking to me
You were made of matches
and you burned me to the ground
You were made of matches
and you burned me down
Everybody says that you're
still living your life
One weekend to the next
still tryna' get it right
The truth is I worry you
never found something to escape
who you used to be
I found my own way of coping
with your mess
And I found my own reasons
why you weren't the best for me
Why couldn't you be the best for me
How did you break my heart
without even trying
How are you on my mind
You're not even talking to me
You were made of matches

You were made of matches

You were made of matches

Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense

If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

What will we do when we get old
Will we walk down the same road
Will you be there by my side
Standing strong as
the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on

Lean on lean on lean on lean on

Hot Air Balloon (Album Version),"7,334",Owl City,"We wrote a prelude
To our own fairy tale
And bought a parachute
At a church rummage sale
And with a mean
sewing machine
And miles of thread
We sewed the day above L.A.
In navy and red
We wound a race track
Through your mom's
kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back
Down your dark basement stairs
I lit a match then let it catch
To light up the room
And then you yelled as we beheld
An old maroon hot air balloon
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out of ideas
Pretty soon
So let's spend
The afternoon in a cold
hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean up and touch
the treetops over town
I can't wait
To kiss the ground
Wherever we touch back down
La la la la la laaa
La la la la la laaa
We drank the Great Lakes
Like cold lemonade
And both got stomach aches
Sprawled out in the shade
So bored to death
you held your breath
And I tried not to yawn
You made my frown
turn upside down
And now my worries are gone
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out of ideas
Pretty soon
So let's spend
The afternoon in a cold
hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean up and touch
the treetops over town
I can't wait
To kiss the ground
Wherever we touch back down

I know that I've been lately lately

I need someone to pick me up
Overdose my mind
with the things I love

When my heart beats
when my heart beats free

in the middle of a crisis

To help with the pressure

Thinking it mattered
Been with you for hours

It's only moments
and I'm in heaven
It's only moments

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control

Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Ride it, from head to toe

Movida was the club on the Saturday
You're actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
Re-apply your lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me, we gotta go
Won't you take me home? I wanna
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control

Hope (feat. Winona Oak),"16,616",The Chainsmokers,"I would have walked through fire
to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it
of what you did
Still see your old apartment
like a bad trip
Wish I could forget
all the places we've been
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy you know
how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older
I can see why
You made me feel high
'Cause you had me
so low low low
You owe me some time
'Cause you stunted
my growth growth growth
I only wanted you
'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love that wasn't love
that was just hope
That wasn't love that wasn't love
that was just hope
Always another bender
I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me
darling
But I never had it did I
Your heart's a trick
And all the magic
we felt was just a hit
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy you know
how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older
I can see why
You made me feel high

Lovers In A Past Life,187,Calvin Harris,"Patience, feels like I've been waiting for a lifetime
For lightning to strike me
Daydreams, feels like I've been sending out the signals
Hoping that you'll find me

I don't need the details, you don't need to tell me
It's like I already know where you'll be

You and me
We were lovers in a past life
Slow dancing in the midnight glow
I wanna hold you for a lifetime
For all we know
And these are familiar places
And maybe we're not just strangers
You and me
We were lovers in a past life
For all we know

Distance only ever makes the heart grow stronger
Late at night, I wonder
Were you thinking of me in someone else's arms?
Does that feel like it's meant to be?

You and me
We were lovers in a past life
Slow dancing in the midnight glow
I wanna hold you for a lifetime
For all we know
And these are familiar places
And maybe we're not just strangers
You and me
We were lovers in a past life
For all we know

We were lovers

I wanna hold you for a lifetime"

Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves
Oh, no damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

You get too close, you'll get a royalty high

To all of the queens who are fighting alone

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh"
Running Out of Roses,"3,229",Alan Walker,"I'm all by myself
seen this show like a thousand times
It's a side effect
loneliness without no reply
In my mind I just keep pretending
it's a big old lie
Big old lie big old lie
Dancing on the tables
city full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces
ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone
Oh my God did we go too far
Did we waste it all like
we're running out of roses
Plastic cups did we laugh enough
Looking back on us now
that everything is over
Oh my God did we go too far
Did we waste it all
had we're running out of roses
Plastic cups still we laugh enough
Looking back on us
now that everything is over
On a night like this
All I know is what I should've said
In the life I've lived
All the things I wanna do again
When the silence sings
Swear I'll never let a day go by
Day go by day go by
Dancing on the tables
city full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces
ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone
Oh my God did we go too far
Did we waste it all
had we're running out of roses
Plastic cups still we laugh enough
Looking back on us
now that everything is over
Oh my God did we go too far
Did we waste it all
had we're running out of roses
Plastic cups still we laugh enough
Looking back on us
now that everything is over"
Thorns,"7,528",Faustix,"I brought a dozen roses

Ooh you won't get the best of me
You won't get the best of me
I don't need ya I don't need ya

Thank you for hurting me
This is the pain that I need

Sometimes you gotta bleed
To know how good it can feel
When you finally heal

Closer (Feat. Halsey) (R3hab Remix),"9,280",The Chainsmokers,"Hey I was doing just fine
before I met you
I drink too much and
that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey you tell your friends
it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty
in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer
in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why
I left you I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tuscon okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer
in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older"

About a boy and a girl
And the girl loves the boy

Heart over Mind,345,Alan Walker,"I should've locked the door
Pinned myself to the floor
Made someone cover my eyes
'Cause when the devil's on my left
Telling me to go ahead
You're right back in my mind

I'm a human tug of war
How do I cut the chord
Feel like I'm stumbling blind
And with the angel on my right
Telling me to pick a side
Tonight's too hard to fight
Heart over mind

Oh you make me wanna
Throw my body into the fire
Should've known better
'Cause you're dangerous
A painful love
Tonight's too hard to fight
Heart over mind

Oh you make me wanna
Take it all and swallow my pride
Should've known better
'Cause you're dangerous
A painful love
Tonight's too hard to fight
Heart over mind

Tonight's too hard to fight
Heart over mind

You should've stayed away
Known what a mess you'd make
Said it's a bad idea
Should've picked kindness over cruel
What a stupid thing to do
Now I, I can't rewind
Heart over mind

Oh you make me wanna
Throw my body into the fire
Should've known better
'Cause you're dangerous
A painful love
Tonight's too hard to fight
Heart over mind

Oh you make me wanna
Take it all and swallow my pride
Should've known better
'Cause you're dangerous
A painful love
Tonight's too hard to fight

Fireflies,"14,148",Owl City,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I
Would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay
awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems
Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightening bugs
As they tried to
teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is
just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems
When I fall asleep
Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too
tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes
as they said farewell
said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
Cause I saved a few
And I keep them in a jar
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everythingis never as it seems
When I fall asleep
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems
When I fall asleep
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are
bursting at the seams"

Yeah things were sweet
three months ago
When I was living
how I wanna on my own

don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

They were so overrated

Wanna stay
can you give me a reason

but I'm not sure
She can love someone
back the way they love her
I don't think so I don't think so
Don't be mean if you wanna go
You can leave
and leave my heart alone
Waking up to nothing
when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep
at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection
All you do is roll your eyes
Broken down I've had enough
If this is love I don't want it
Give it time
c'mon babe it's been ten months
You should know do you know
know what you want
I don't think so I don't think so
Make it work know it
hurts but I'll go there
Do the same can you
show me that you care
God I hope so but I don't think so
Don't be mean if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you
Waking up to nothing
when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep
at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection
All you do is roll your eyes
Broken down I've had enough
If this is love I don't want it
All my friends keep saying
that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested
I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy and you know
it and you still don't even try

Cheerleader,95,Porter Robinson,"There’s no doubt
I can tell you’re acting your heart out
And she’s addicted, obsessed like “I know I can fix him”
She’s got hearts in her eyes
And she draws me kissing other guys
Her love, the type
Where she don’t know where to draw the line, oh
Cheerleader
Thought she needed me but I need her
She’s wanting me, telling me, screaming

It’s not fair
Cause I knew you like the back of my hand
Don’t you care?
I gave you everything, ah
Now I feel you even when you’re not there

It’s kinda sad how
It’s not your fault you’re living in a madhouse
I can’t back down
Aren’t you tired of blending into the background?
Oh-oh

She’s got hearts in her eyes
Sayin, “boy you better watch the time
Cus if you’re not mine
I’d rather see you burned alive”

Cheerleader, says she hates me cause
I’m not hers
Wanting me, telling me, screaming

It’s not fair
Cause I knew you like the back of my hand
And you don’t care?
I gave you everything
Now I feel you even when you’re not there

Somehow
I don’t even know what she does now
Do I wish her the best
Or do i actually miss her?
She had hearts in her eyes
She was rooting for me all the time
Her love, the type that makes you dedicate your life

Oh
My cheerleader
Thought she needed me
But I need her

It’s not fair
Cause I knew you like the back of my hand
And you don’t care?
I gave you everything
Now I feel you even when you’re not there
Now I feel you even when you’re not there"

Haven't seen your face in five days
I'll pretend
I'm happy that you're home
Cleaned up and I hid the ashtrays

when I smoke at your place
You won't kiss me
so I guess you'll never know
I thought that I could save it
But we're beyond repair
I could be on fire
and you wouldn't care
Welcome to the end
Guess you get your way again
Never held my hand
so you don't have to let it go
Welcome to the mess
Slippin' on my mini dress
I don't wanna party
but don't want to be alone
I hate the way that I love you
I don't want to
How can you hurt me
when you're not around
Welcome to the end
Guess you get your way again
Never held my hand
so you don't have to let it go
Last night I was out with your friends
Got drunk and forgot what I said
Don't like this version of myself
I'm not fine but it's easy to fake it
Good advice
but it's harder to take it
When my mind sees
you with someone else
I thought that I could save it
But we're beyond repair
I could be on fire and
you wouldn't care

Never held my hand

Take Back My Love (Feat. Dia Frampton),791,Frank Pole,"Where were you when I needed you, When I needed you back then
What am I supposed to do when you just play pretend
All those nights and stupid fights is how it always ends
Always ends
Gave you what I had to give but you don't give the same
Gave you all my time but all I ever did was wait
Built your walls so high that I could never break you down
Even if I wanted, I just keep you around
Grab your keys to the apartment
Get your things
No, I don't want 'em
Take what you want
But you can't take back my love
There's no point in saying you're sorry
All that stupid shit that you bought me
Take what you want
But you can't take back my love
Can't take back my love
Can't take back my love
Can't take back my love
Can't take back my love
I was used to putting you before anyone else
Somewhere between losing you I only lost myself
Poured my heart out on my sleeve, but you just wore me down
Wish I didn't have to, but I can't keep you around
Grab your keys to the apartment
Get your things
No, I don't want 'em
Take what you want
But you can't take back my love

As black as diamonds
We're running out of time

Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies
Believe it I see it
I know that you can feel it
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

I wish that I was someone else
I wish that I was someone else

I think of the evenings
And wine on the weekend
I hate to admit, that I was so in the deep end
And we split a taxi, hold hands on the backseat
Yeah I could’ve sworn, you really did want me

Then we’re in the club
And you’re kissing her neck
I’m stood by myself, texting my friends
Cuz I hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
And I’m getting a drink while you’re falling in love
And you dance with her like you did with us
And I hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
I wish that I was someone else
I wish that I was someone else

So tell me, baby, why not me
Was I just a novelty
Why’d you choose her over me
Tell me, baby, why not me
Did you love me honestly
God, I hate that you’re happy

Then we’re in the club
And you’re kissing her neck
I’m stood by myself, texting my friends
Cuz I hate to see you with someone else
And I’m getting a drink while you’re falling in love
And you dance with her like you did with us
And I hate to see you with someone else
I wish that I was someone else
I wish that I was someone else"

I'm the dark in need of light
And when we touch you inspire
Feel the change in me tonight
So take me up take me higher
There's a wall not far from here
We can die in desire
Or we can burn in love tonight

where I hurt you
Is it wrong for me to wonder
How you've been
How you've been

That I'll send

Feelings I believe in
This is power for real
We climb into your backseat
time stops
Rain on the windows of your car
This is how you
feel when you think of me
This is how you
feel when you think of me
This is how you
feel when you think of me
This is how you
feel when you think of me
Talking to the ceiling
To each other I can feel it
'Cause these feelings I believe in
This is power for real
We climb into your backseat
time stops"
Not Cool,963,More Giraffes,"I'm at the liquor store

Fucked up and furthermore
I left my wallet too
Always reminded me
'fore I walked out the door
Absentmindedly
don't have you anymore
I need you in my life
I feel it all the time all the time
Baby I'm trippin'
heart is rippin' apart
Without you without you
And now I'm all alone

It's not cool it's not cool
It's not cool not not cool
It's not cool not not cool
I'm on that take out game
each night of the week
Honestly too much lo mein

I don't even shower now

I need you in my life
I feel it all the time all the time

I Go,523,Peggy Gou,"삶에 지친 내 모습 또 비쳐지네
사람들이 네게 행복하냐 물어보네
힘든 내 맘 들어줄 친구들 생각나네
다 말 할 수도 없고
i go i go i go i go i go i go
i go i go i go i go i go i go
힘차게 달려 나가
상상을 해봐 어린날처럼
용기를 내봐
푸른별의 시들은 oh 굽이치네
슬픔 기쁨은 모처럼
가릴수가 없네 세차지는 세상속에
난 멈추지 않네
나는 또 원한다오
i go i go i go i goi go i go
i go i go i go i goi go i go
힘차게 달려나가 상상을 해봐
어린날처럼 용기를 내봐
용기를 내봐 용기를 내봐"
Closer (Feat. Jennie A.),"8,470",Lemaitre,"I feel the shadows hanging over
They're waiting to come closer
To come and take me away
And I can feel my heart skip
Everytime that I slip
I wanna run away
I I've been working the morning
Don't get off till the night
I can't find no time
to clear my mind
Oh I dream of the lazy days
Or for one of the careless ways
for me to be a'living
I feel the shadows hanging over
They're waiting to come closer
To come and take me away
And I can feel my heart skip
Everytime that I slip
I wanna run away

They're waiting to come closer
To come and take me away
And I can feel my heart skip
Everytime that I slip

All You Need Is Love,368,Nicky Romero,"I see you're lost inside
It's Heaven on your back,
pushin' angels away
You found the truth in lies
'Cause Heaven ain't the place
that you thought it would be
Feeling trapped under
all of that pressure
Promise you that it's gonna get better
Holding on when you know
you should walk away
Save a little piece of your heart
It's okay if you let go
Save a little light in the dark
For the nights when it gets cold
Save a little hope for the days
that don't make sense
It's never too late to
start again, whoa, oh-oh
Save a little piece of your heart
'Cause all you need is love
You see the warning signs
But you're blinded by the love
so you're taking the blame
Still tryna change that high
But it's hard to tame a fire
when you're fueling the flame
Feeling trapped under
all of that pressure
Promise you that it's gonna get better
Holding on when you know
you should walk away
Save a little piece of your heart
It's okay if you let go
Save a little light in the dark
For the nights when it gets cold
Save a little hope for the days
that don't make sense
It's never too late to
start again, whoa, oh-oh

Feel like I'm floating through the air
The pain I felt is paid for, all is said and done, oh
I am restricted, fixed upon the web
I need to kick the habit that my mind is breathing in
Break out, I've got to see (break out, I've got to see)
Spent all my life holding all of it closely
I played it innocent, a feel of discontent
I'm finally facing it all, fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Burning the bridge that keeps us
I'm here and I'm feeling fearless
Exaggerated, that's what you assume
The story's over now, I must conclude
I am conflicted, watching where I step, still
Hanging in the balance, not the life I want to live
I want to take it all, standing tall
Fear outweighed the person you are (oh-ooh)
Break out, I've got to see (break out, I've got to see)
Spent all my life holding all of it closely

I know, sometimes this life
can break your heart
When some things fall apart,
there's no good in goodbye
But the darkest night won't
always be that dark
Tears are gonna fall,
tears are gonna dry
Gotta let it go, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Fantasy,"14,234",Alina Baraz,"So you say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane
I could be your escape
Take you to a place
Where there's no time no space
I could be your private island
On a different planet
Anything could happen
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain
I could be your fantasy
I could be your fantasy
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Say you wanna get so high
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
I could be your fantasy
So you say you wanna get so high
Breathe me in like air tonight
Let yourself unwind get lost
In the garden of my mind
I could be your private island
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain
I could be your fantasy
I could be your fantasy
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries

Everything But You (feat. A7S),"1,059",Clean Bandit,"Oh my heart needs some headspace
Every night try to escape
Got me calling for your name
Feel you touching
You take me to a place only we know
Away from all the noise and the people
You take me to a place only we know
When I hear your voice
say the word and we'll go
'Cause darling when we pull close
I know we can pull through
I just wanna let go
Of everything but you
'Cause nothing even matters
If it's me you're holding on to
I just wanna let go
Of everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but you
I'm so tired of the hollow
Show me signs I can follow
Baby I go where you go
Don't you know that
You take me to a place only we know
When I hear your voice
say the word and we'll go
'Cause darling when we pull close
I know we can pull through
I just wanna let go
Of everything but you
'Cause nothing even matters
If it's me you're holding on to
I just wanna let go
Of everything but you
Everything but you
If I lose if I'm losing myself tonight
I'll be fine if I'm finally by your side
If I lose if I'm losing myself
it'll be alright
'Cause darling when we pull close
I know we can pull through
I just wanna let go
Of everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but you"
Lost And Found,54,Chromeo,"Remember Steve, he's such a thief
He stole your heart and promised he would never leave
And Stephanie, oh, what a tease
We fell in love and then we turned to frenemies
Remember Rob was on his job
Until you caught him talking with your best friend
And then there was Simone, I should've known
She stuck around a minute then the next she's gone

But you're the one that got away, ran away
When they thought that you would stay down
I guess we both needed a change
And it saved the day
Found a way out

Girl, we've seen it all between you and I
Exes so lame, they got no shame
If they ever run into you and I
They should apologize

I was lost, now I found you
I was lost, now I found you

Remember Paul, he's dark and tall
And handsome but he ends up playing you for a fool
And I won't even mention Ella
I could write a whole novella
About the way she caught an attitude

But you're the one that got away, ran away
When they thought that you would stay down
I guess we both needed a change
And it saved the day
Found a way out

Girl, we've seen it all between you and I
Exes so lame, they got no shame
And if they ever run into you and I
They should apologize

I was lost, now I found you
I was lost, now I found you
I was lost, now I found you
I was lost, now I found you

Girl, we've seen it all between you and I
And if they ever run into you and I
They should apologize

I was lost, now I found you
And I don't know what I would manage to do
I was lost, now I found you
And I don't know what I would manage to do without you
I was lost, now I found you
God only knows the type of things we've been through
I was lost, now I found you
And I don't know what I would manage to do without you"

All this feeling
It keeps pulling in myself to you
Wonder why
All this feeling

Are we trapped in this space

Runaway with me Runaway with me

Oh tell me where Wonder why
Anywhere anyplace but here
Just say what you want So
Wonder why connected

All this love is killing and
begging me in virtual
Captivated in this clouds
I wonder why all of these
feelings just delusional
If i do have some feelings
That i still don't believe in
Wonder why
Will you plan to get off this phase
After all this chase

I Don't Wanna Love You Anymore,"5,495",LANY,"I used to love these sheets
Dark hair against the white
I missed watching you get dressed
in our hazy bedroom light
It took a couple weeks
Last night I finally cried
I remembered us in London
your chocolate-covered eyes
Sick of staring up at the ceiling
How'd you change your mind
just like that
The only way to get past this feeling
Is to tell myself
you're not coming back
I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
From the start
I never thought I'd say this before
But I don't wanna love you anymore
You got that letter framed
Is it still up on that shelf
It's the one I left on our bed
When you were out of town
Sick of staring up at the ceiling
How'd you change your mind
just like that
The only way to get past this feeling
Is to tell myself
you're not coming back
I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
From the start
I never thought I'd say this before
But I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
I can't forget the way it felt
when you walked out the door
So I don't wanna love you anymore
Sometimes I just
wanna talk for a minute
But I can't bring myself to call
Because I know
that your heart's not really in it
And whatever we had is gone
Sometimes I just
wanna talk for a minute
But I can't bring myself to call
Because I know
that your heart's not really in it
And whatever we had is gone
I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
From the start I never thought
I'd say this before
But I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
Talk for a minute
I don't wanna love you anymore
I can't forget the way it felt
when you walked out the door
So I don't wanna love you anymore"
Last Summer (Feat. Lights),"4,267",Tokyo Machine,"I remember when the bartender
said it's on the house
You make me wanna fall in love
The weather felt better
When we were in it together
I miss the way we used
to talk about nothing
I hate to say I should've seen it coming
Last summer, everything was easy (easy)
We had it all, didn't we baby?
No wonder you
couldn't keep me (keep me)
It got harder than you
thought it would be
You stopped loving me
on the dark nights
Now you won't kiss me in the sunlight
Last summer,
I knew you'd leave me (leave me)
'Cause loving me isn't easy
'Cause loving me isn't easy
'Cause loving me isn't easy
If you wanted to talk,
you would've texted
If I wanted to stop, I would've let it go
But I get it, it's alright
'Cause I can't keep my shit together
Say fuck it, yeah, can't debate that
Don't want shit to get better
'Cause it'd make me forget it
all and I hate that
Last summer, everything was easy (easy)
We had it all, didn't we baby?
No wonder you

Heartbeat Highway,112,Cannons,"I caught a smile that you meant to hide
When you were sitting in my passenger seat on the 405
And your cigarette smoke rose like a serpent of light
One of those moments where everything is alright

But sooner, later, danger, danger
Need to give you this disclaimer
Know it may not be forever
Sooner, later, danger, danger
Write me up for bad behavior
And I, and I, and I

And I'm here tonight to ride this though
And just for tonight, I'm here with you
'Cause I'm goin' through emotions in motion with you
And I'm here tonight, riding down this road with you
Down this road with you

Another day, lost inside the maze
Maybe I'm not my best
But I'm trying my best
That should be okay

But sooner, later, danger, danger
Need to give you this disclaimer
Know it may not be forever
Sooner, later, danger, danger
Write me up for bad behavior
And I, and I, and I

And I'm here tonight to ride this though
And just for tonight, I'm here with you

Thru These Tears,"5,940",LANY,"This hurts like hell

It's gonna get better
But it's taking forever

Of what's now behind me
Everyday I let go
Just a little bit more
In the end I'm gonna be alright
But it might
take a hundred sleepless nights
To make the memories
of you disappear
But right now I can't see
nothing through these tears
Control my thoughts
Convincing myself it's your loss
I really mean it
And I'm starting to believe it
'Cause everyday I let go

take a hundred sleepless nights

take somebody else at night
To make it feel like
you were never here

nothing through these tears
You said it was over
But when we got closer
You cried on my shoulder
Goodbye

take a hundred sleepless nights
To make the memories
of you disappear

take somebody else at night

I want you down on your knees

And I fall down

When I can't find the answers

And I falter you pick me up again
Fall down you pick me up again
When I fall down

From risin' sea to settin' sun
We'll be together forever young
In the dead of night

Crawl under covers

When I can't stand

When I can't find the answers

When I fall down you pick me up
When I fall down

Every Minute,26,Yann Muller,"Once there was a man
With nowhere to go
But time in his hands

He made me believe
Told me stories
Bout all of his friends

But now he was alone
At end of the road
With somewhere to go
But he’s moving to slow

There’s a lesson in life
So please listen close
I want you to know

You’ve got to live every minute
Before you know, you run out of time
You’ve got to live every second
Like it’s the last one of your life

Oh I’ve always tried to do it right
And now I start realize that I could do no wrong
Just go and live every second
Like it’s the last one of your life
One of your life

He, he was afraid
Playing it safe
Inside the lines

No choice that he made
Would be a mistake
But he paid the price

Now he was alone
At end of the road
With somewhere to go
But he’s moving to slow
There’s a lesson in life
So please listen close
I want you to know

Now he was alone
At end of the road
With somewhere to go
But he’s moving to slow
There’s a lesson in life
So please listen close
I want you to know

You’ve got to live every minute
Before you know, you run out of time
You’ve got to live every second
Like it’s the last one of your life

Oh I’ve always tried to do it right
And now I start realize that I could do no wrong
You’ve got to live every second
Like it’s the last one of your life
Of your life
Like it’s the last one of your life
One of your life"

somewhere new from here

Always make you blush, cause I give you what you want

Baby do we have the same agenda
I don’t want no one to hear us shout

To paint with passion
It was planets meeting
It was synced up breathing
There were angels callin'

Than I believed in
Memories like freight trains
hit me
I replay to keep you with me
Better to have had than not at all
We were chasing stars
Across the county lines
Two imperfect pieces
With our fingers intertwinеd
And I would do it all again
Knowing I'd be left behind
Oh what a timе
Back when you were mine
Oh I'm hurting
But I'm still certain
That when the pain
comes back in waves
Yeah it was worth it yeah

You all pass up
And I guess that means
More freaks fo' me
So

Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas),"13,811",Daft Punk,"I didn't want to be
the one to forget
I thought of everything
I'd never regret
A little time with you
is all that I get
That's all we need
because it's all we can take
One thing I never see
the same way around
I don't believe it
and it slips on the ground
I wanna take you to that
place in the Roche
But no one gives us
any time anymore
You used me once
if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it
then you ran off
I got this picture of us
kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing
that you said
I listened to your problems
now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore
oh oh oh
And we will never be
alone again
Cause it doesn't happen
every day
Kinda counted on you
being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about
what I wanna say
But I never really know
where to go
So I chained myself
to a friend
Cause there's nowhere else
I could go
And we will never be
alone again
Cause it doesn't happen
every day
Kinda counted on you
being a friend
Kinda given up on
giving away
Now I thought about
what I wanna say
But I never really know
where to go
So I chained myself
to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what
they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone
that looked just like me
The summer memory
that just never dies
We worked too long and
hard to give it no time
He sees right through me
it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that
I would try and disguise
He runs the scissor
at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down
or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars
hiding in the cold
Take it
oh I don't wanna sing
anymore
Listen to you brother
and listen to me
I didn't want to anymore
oh oh oh
And we will never be
alone again
Cause it doesn't happen
every day
Kinda counted on you
being a friend
Kinda given up on
giving away
Now I thought about
what I wanna say

know where to go

But I never really know
where to go
So I chained myself
to a friend
Cause there's nowhere
else I could
I don't understand
don't get upset
I'm not with you
We’re swimming around
It's all I do
when I'm with you
And we will never be
alone again
Cause it doesn't happen
every day
Kinda counted on you
being a friend
Kinda given up on
giving away

Remember,"1,880",Becky Hill,"I'm doing just fine now it's over
I've been moving on and
living my life
But occasionally I lose composure
And I can't get you out of my mind

I'd do things differently yeah
I wouldn't think twice
I distract myself
think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me
It's only when I'm lying in bed
on my own
And I wake up and
I don't see your name
on my phone
'Til the moments where I think that
I'm better alone
That's when I remember
that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house
in the rain
And I tell myself that
you were the biggest mistake
Then just when I think
I'm finally doing okay
That's when I remember
that's when I remember
My friends tell me I shouldn't listen
To the voices that go round
in my head
So I try to delete all the memories
But you're really hard to forget
If I could go back in time

Where the winners might be sweet all around
Tell me your life.

If you wanna take a look around
Please don't hit a man who understands
As the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place
In the night you're looking for to meet
And checking the man to get in fit


Just the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place

Yeti, looking a horrid man.

I feel with you and I know that you are living apart

Burning up burning up

you caught me off guard

you moved out west
You tell me stories
underneath sunsets
Could it be more
than just one night
Kiss in the cab ride
head turning left right
Get a ticket for two
to wherever you choose
Drinkin' some red out of the blue
You say my name
with your accent
Makes me remember
how much I missed ya
Hope you're planning to stay
for a million days
You'll be my summer in December
Hey boy trust my intuitions
Always I'm not superstitious
I got lucky
Stole your heart
and it was mine for the taking
I'm bad at pretending
you know I'll be true
Sunday mornings
and midnight lights
Turn into songs
that you watch me write
Stole your sweater
on that night
You took a picture
keep by my bedside
So you're mine when you're gone
Baby please don't be long
I got my ticket to the westside
You say my name
with your accent
Makes me remember
how much I missed ya
Hope you're plannin' to stay
for a million days
You'll be my summer in December
Hey boy trust my intuitions
Always I'm not superstitious
I got lucky
Stole your heart
and it was mine for the taking

It was mine for a million days
In a million ways
Stole your heart and I got lucky
Stole your heart and it was mine
In a million ways

Past Life (Koven Remix),66,Felix Jaehn,"Did you wake up and feel
Like we've been here before?
'Cause the rush that I felt when you held me
I can't ignore
And the way that your hands
Found their way to mine
It feels like a journey they've taken
A thousand times
I keep thinkin' back to last night
We danced together 'til the daylight
So familiar how it felt like
I swear we fell in love in a past life
I keep thinkin' back to last night
We found each other in the spotlight
And there's no way it was thе first time
I swear we fеll in love in a past life
Was it a trick of the light
Or was it déjà vu?
Was it a memory I saw in a flashback
When I looked at you? (When I looked at you)
Was it a higher power
Some kind of energy (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh, that always knew one day
You would come back to me?
I keep thinkin' back to last night
We danced together 'til the daylight
So familiar how it felt like
I swear we fell in love in a past life
Oh, I keep thinkin' back to last night
We found each other in the spotlight
And there's no way it was the first time
I swear we fell in love in a past life
In a past life
In a past life
In a past life
In a past life"

And we're burning bright here in the dark
There ain't much in this world that we can't face together

They are strewn in the city
Daily struggle to be true
Betrayed authenticity
Poison world around but still
I will take another round
Or another ride until
We take off from the ground

Reach that skyline

Control (Feat. Jex),"2,381",Unknown Brain,"Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Filling the lungs inside you
In the blackest night
Make my way into your mind
Just to know what you knew
Restless every time
we start locking eyes
Oh oh oh oh
Lost control
Oh it’s paradise with a nasty bite
Oh oh oh oh
In the dead of the night
Let the darkness take control
Let the darkness take control
The darkness take control
May the darkness take control
Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Sink to your heart to find you
Open up your eyes
‘Til you're blinded by the lies
So you can see what you do
Restless every time
we start locking eyes
Oh oh oh oh
Lost control
Oh it’s paradise with a nasty bite
Oh oh oh oh
In the dead of the night
Teardrops on the floor
The pain is over
Feel the darkness
Take control
May the darkness take control"

And every night has its day

And if there's love in this life
there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty
arms were open
Thursday waiting for love
waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone
wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to
church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
waiting for love
To come around
We are one of
a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind
and so cynical
If there's love in this life
we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love"

Running rivers in my eyes right
When I think of you and I
I don’t know why

I Cry every night
Kind of makes me want to die but
I just do it for the ride, these waterslides

If I could cry enough I would swim to your love
I could cry you the Nile
Cause you out then you in, you’ve been gone with the wind
Oh your lov’in is tidal

Baby with just a touch I’d be back at the start
You got me go’in in spirals
Cause oooo baby I , I keep on running to you

Running rivers in my eyes right
When I think of you and I
I don’t know why

I Cry every night
Kind of makes me want to die but

I don’t know why

I Cry every night
Kind of makes me want to die but
I just do it for the ride, these waterslides

Everytime I try to get you off my mind, I can’t help it I backslide
Everytime I try and try to dry my eyes, I can’t help it my eyes cry
I can’t help that I love you really
Wish I could leave but Im caught in the feeling
Summer just started but it’s cold in the night when you’re not here by my side

my picture changed
I was blinded

in a different frame

Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
without you I am lonely
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention
to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears
are an omen

You left before my eyes
then it hit me
You're relocating and
I need you by my side

without you I am lonely

Blue skies, blue sea
It's a long way from Siberia
How did you get here?

Jumped the barrier at Orly Airport
Claimed political asylum there
Took all the KGB boys by surprise
I think they thought that you would never dare
But you knew you had to take a risk
You broke the rules over and over again
A fiery talent with a reputation
A trouble-maker among sombre men

(Dancing star)
That's what you are
(Came so far)
You're a dancing star
(Dancing star)
More power than a tsar
(Yes, you are)
You're a dancing star

When the streets of London sang with pop stars
Well the truth is that they always do
In the 60s you could feel the freedom
And the brightest star in town was you
Always a scandal and a real heart-breaker
Boys and girls both threw themselves at you

(Dancing star)
That's how bright you shine
(Dancing star)
When all your stars align

I know you're there but I can't see you anymore

What I mean to you do I belong
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helplessly
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again

Nada tiene por que importar
Dejalo atras estas conmigo

So what you waiting for
Wait before you burn me
to the ground
Please stay till the beat
of our heart runs out
I don't wanna let go let go
'Cause I've been tryna
hold on for so long
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away

I've watched all my loves
Move on to something more
Open out the door
Caught in-between every passing hour
Oh please stay until
the taste of your love turns sour
I don't wanna let go let go
'Cause I've been tryna
hold on for so long

Without You (Feat. Usher),"9,570",David Guetta,"I can’t win, I can’t reign

I will never win this game without you

Without you

I am lost, I am vain

I will never be the same without you

Without you

I won’t run, I won’t fly

I will never make it by without you

Without you

I can’t rest, I can’t fight

All I need is you and I without you

Without… you

Oh, oh, oh

You

Without

You

Without you

Can’t erase, so I’ll take blame

But I can’t accept that we’re estranged

Without you, without you

I can’t quit now

This can’t be right

I can’t take one more sleepless night without you, without you

I won’t soar, I won’t climb

If you’re not here, I’m paralyzed without you

Without you

I can’t look, I’m so blind

I lost my heart, I lost my mind without you

Without… you

Oh, oh, oh

You

Without

You

Without you

I am lost, I am vain

I will never be the same without you

Without you

Without you"

Holdin' On (Skrillex & Nero Remix),"7,619",Monsta,"I keep holdin' on
Broken footsteps on the floor
I keep holdin' on
Pick myself up and carry on

And I won't let them write my song
I keep holdin' on
Keep my direction and soon
I'll be turned to gold
A king without a throne
a heart without a home
Just cards that
I've been dealt in life
I'll walk it all alone
but my hope will never die
But my hope will never die
My hope will never die
My hope will never die

Broken footsteps on the floor
Pick myself up and carry on

Cassette,"1,236",ayokay,"V1:
Float around you like a satellite, this big divide
But you always got a pull on me

Sink or Swim, yeah you're my Ocean tide, the more I fight it
The more you've got a hold on me

Pre:
Out with other guys
While I'm stuck here chasing lonely nights
Every now and then I give you up
And that's when you act so in to us

Chorus:
Call it what it is
Pretend it's the Apocalypse
If I was the last man here on Earth
Then do you think we could make it work

Treat me like I'm your Cassette
Wind me up after you're done with it
If I was the last man here on Earth
What's it gunna take to make this work

V2:
Drove to LA tryna to find myself, be someone else
Said I wouldn't, so I called your bluff

Now I'm living back in N-Y-C, and all I can see
Are the years that got away from us

Pre 2:
Out with other guys
While I'm stuck here chasing lonely nights
Every now and then I give you up
And that's when you act so in to us

Don't think I don't think about you
Every night I drink without you

Vibe Like This (Feat. Ty Dolla $ign),"1,273",SG Lewis,"Been around the world, I did
Never felt a vibe like this
Might be worth the risk
To make up for the time I missed

for the time I missed

When I pull up Imma slide this
Do your two step,
I do mines like this
AP your wrist girl,
ain't no better time than this
G5 really no flyer than this
Crocodile Birkin,
I did it for Steve Irwin
Whatever it takes
to get you back,
girl I'll put the work in just
Let me know where you wanna go
Make believe or reality
Come slide on me show
it's real if you feeling me
I can fill up the energy
In the meantime, between time,
in your arms wish we could
freeze time, I need mine
Only one in here I wanna try
Been around the world, I did
Never felt a vibe like this
Might be worth the risk
To make up for the time I missed
Been around the world, I did
And I never felt a vibe like this
And it might be worth the risk
To make up for the time I missed
Tell me that that pussy's
still mine, is it all me
And you'll never give it up
to one of my colleagues
We should go to Bali,
after that The Maldives
You said if it's real then,
I'll give you these house keys
And make this house
where the home is
I know you like Diamonds and Roses
Tell me what your goal is
Imma make sure
you never know what alone is
Let me know where you wanna go
Make believe or reality
Come slide on me show
it's real if you feeling me
I can fill up the energy
In the meantime, between time,
in your arms wish we could
freeze time, I need mine
Only one in here I wanna try
Been around the world, I did
Never felt a vibe like this
Might be worth the risk
To make up for the time I missed
Been around the world, I did
And I never felt a vibe like this
And it might be worth the risk

Through the darkness
I see your eyes
And realize that I that I Drive
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night
drive all night ah-ah
Do what makes you feel alive
You can drive all night
drive all night
'Cause the road's callin'
over again
Ride to the morning
right to the end now
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night
drive all night
Drive all night"
Happy Now (feat. Sandro Cavazza),"5,296",Kygo,"We don't want to believe it

Heading Home,"6,202",Alan Walker,"I was so insatiable
'Til the lights came on
and the stories got old
Now there's no one here I know
And the city outside
it's not the same anymore

when we were young
We'd write our names in the sand
So carelessly
Then the rain came
and yours was gone
And now mine it stays alone
Nobody sees me
now I'm a one man show
I'll do this on my own
We knew it all then now
this is all I know
Guess I'm heading home now

Guess I'm heading home now
When the music always played
With the sound of our lives
and the sweetest escape
And the neighbors would complain
We would turn it up louder
who cares anyway
'Cause we we remember
that we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
And we made up castles
and kingdoms of
Now the rains have torn them down

Have you ever wondered
if you loved me harder
Where we'd be where we'd be now
Yeah we got so close so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough

you would show me
i had something
some people call a soul
you dropped out the sky
oh you arrived
when i was 3 years old
no one knows me like the piano
in my mother's home
you know i left i flew the nest
and you know i won’t be long
and in my chest you know me best
and you know i’ll be back home
an angel by her side
oh all the times
i knew we couldn't cope
they said that it's her time

let me go

the top to the ground

Carry You (Feat. Declan J Donovan),168,Martin Garrix,"We are never going home
We're the wild ones living on the go
You know that there is no rest for the wicked
I will show you if you come with me
Make you feel like it was all a dream
Imagine it's like heaven for a sinner
I can lead the way
Let me ease your pain
When the whole world is against you I will carry you
Carry you away
Through the darkest days
When the whole world is against you I will carry you
Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Time will never heal your scars
Might be hard to fix a broken heart
But I can make you forget for a moment
What if this is all we'll ever have
Make it count, don't hold onto the past
And we could light up the sky of tomorrow
I can lead the way
Let me ease your pain
When the whole world is against you I will carry you
Carry you away
Through the darkest days
When the whole world is against you I will carry you
Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Carry you with me
Carry you away
Through the darkest days
When the whole world is against you I will carry you
Carry you with me"

with the broken sword
Now I'm caught in a war
with no shield

Then I surrender surrender

Say you'll stay we'll be forever

I push and pull all the ones that try
Then I'll wash and fade away
As I look around the vacate room
I see nobody left here to play
Cause I made myself a prisoner
Shackle up all my fears
But I feel you're breaking away
out the walls
Make them fall make them

Lying down beside you
what's going through your head
The silence in the air felt like
my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings
I can't say
This gut feeling
I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missing pieces
I'm just sure
We're gonna sweep it under the carpet

Can't control this flame we started

So I drown them out
at night with my TV
You know I got to
Try to ignore these thoughts that
go back and forth inside my head
And if I want you
I should stop
before I'm in to deep

I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue

If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?

Everything will be alright
Wish I had more to give you

But never knew someone

And I know

where I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything
Hardest part is knowing
that I had it
Something almost perfect
we were almost perfect
Maybe it's too late
for me to save this
but I gotta face this
No matter how I hate it
I need your love
To give me hope
when I can't breathe
I need your love
To lift me up when I am weak
I need your love
When I hate every part of me
I need your love to set me free
I need your love
Oh I need your love
I need your love
I need your love tonight
I need your love
just need your love
I need your love tonight
Just need your love
need your love
need your love your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
When I hate every part of me
I need your love to set me free
I need your love"
Hard dreams,46,Gesaffelstein,"I can think of anything as hard as your love
If only I could understand what it is made of
I can think of anything as rough as your love
If only I could understand what it is made of

I trick myself with gasoline
The fire grows inside my skin
No fantasy, no in-betweens
Don't tell me no lies

Finger on the trigger
Letting it all out
Bursting with desire
I can deal without

I can think of anything as hard as your love
If only I could understand what it is made of
I can think of anything as rough as your love
If only I could understand what it is made of

Crouching in the empty scene
I see your face on the video screen
I'm your slave and you're my queen
I picture ourselves in a Hollywood dream
Crouching on the empty scene
Did I see your face on the video screen?
I'm a slave to you, my queen
Imagine ourselves in a Hollywood dream"

Better move to the side yup

Same story on a different page
I just wanted to escape, didn't you know that
Dull nights into brighter days
Always feeling out of place, didn't you know that

Pre-Chorus
I'm not saying I feel nothing when I think of all the memories yea
Of you and me yea
But I'm tired of holding on to something just because I'm scared You're gonna leave yea
You're gonna leave yea

Chorus
I'm not sorry that I've changed for the better
That I've got myself together
Guess I thought that you'd be happier
I'm not sorry that it didn't last forever
But its better late than never
And I'm moving on with or without you

Post-Chorus
And I'm moving on with or without you
And I'm moving on with or without you

Verse 2
I didn't know I was alone
Still I let the feeling go, I hope you know that

I'm not saying I feel nothing when I think of all the memories yea

Can’t be bothered to get up now
I wouldn’t care
If I never get up again
I don’t want to
Then our song comes on the radio
Makes me wanna start to dance oh
I wanna know
If you feel the same way as me
Why would you go
Dancing I’m all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home
Dancing with my phone
Thinking about you
On my feet and now I’m out the door
Walking by the places that we used to go
I remember all your favorite stores
I won’t lie
I don’t think I even know myself anymore
You’re the one who knew me fucking well
Yeah you know
Dancing I’m all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home

Thinking about you
Dancing I’m all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home

Just Another Day (Original Mix),"1,724",3Angle,"Wait a second
For this moment
Don't think about the seasons
you have done
There's no reason if you're boring
Let's wait another chance
will be enough
Turn around a simple game
Driving out your loneliness
Close your eyes
and hold your breath
Take the time for happiness
Every moment lauding yes
We can't stop and we can dance
Every problem flies away
We can play another day
I'm just waiting
I am falling
I'm not surprising
if you'll never come
You understand me
But you don't listen me so much
Let's take the other way
and you have fun
Turn around a simple game
Driving out your loneliness
Close your eyes
and hold your breath
Take the time for happiness
Every moment lauding yes
We can't stop and we can dance
Every problem flies away
We can play another day
Ring around around you'll find
Ring around you'll never die
There's a place deep in the sky
we'll fly together
Fly forever more
Turn around a simple game
Driving out your loneliness
Close your eyes
and hold your breath
Take the time for happiness
Every moment lauding yes
We can't stop and we can dance
Every problem flies away
We can play another day"
Symphony (feat. Zara Larsson),"4,327",Clean Bandit,"I’ve been hearin' symphonies

Now I can’t find
the key without you
And now your song
is on repeat

And when you’re gone
I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be
part of your symphony
Will you hold me
tight and not let go

Will you hold me
tight and not let go

I’d find this feelin'

All your years by his side
And you just say I
Will never say goodbye"
Sunset Jesus,"3,898",Avicii,"Try'na set myself up for the win
So people got a dream
that's so much bigger
than the town they're in
So give me love
give me love
give me peace
give me peace of mind
I know that there's an ought
to a start
and I need a little help with mine
California don't let me down
Seems so golden
but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus came to me
He once was waiter
now he's a savior making money
on the street
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken
and I'm down along the road
But I know
my dreams keep fading
til I get old
Breathe for a minute
breathe for a minute
I'll be okay
Staring at the billboard
from the bus
Looking at the faces
thinking that could be
anyone of us
So give me hope give me hope
give me hope on this lonely ride
Cause I know one day
I'll be the one in the sky
California don't let me down
Seems so golden
but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus came to me
He once was waiter
now he's a savior making money
on the street
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken
and I'm down along the road
But I know
my dreams keep fading
til I get old
Breathe for a minute

Sunset Jesus
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken
and I'm down along the road
But I know
my dreams keep fading
til I get old
Breathe for a minute
breathe for a minute
I'll be okay
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken
and I'm down along the road
But I know
my dreams keep fading
til I get old
Breathe for a minute
breathe for a minute
I'll be okay"

Playing on my heart just like a casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year that’s not original
Or cynical alright let’s go now

When all your dreams are gone
And you’re still holding on
You waited far too long
Don’t say I know, you know
It’s over

Play it cool
I just want the keys back to my vehicle
They just gonna tell that it wasn’t real
And I just wanna tell you how i feel
I know you feel
I know you feel it too

When all your dreams are gone
And you’re still holding on
You waited far too long
Don’t say I know, you know
It’s over

I think I gotta go soon and
Nowadays we don't really do communication
Or things of that nature, yeah
I don't wanna ghost you but
I don't really wanna go through
Just another uncomfortable conversation

So this is where I fade out
Yeah, this is where I fade out

Sorry to disappear
But I know that I can't say what you want to hear
You'll get over it
I never wanna give out fake love
Nothing you can say when my mind's made up
So sorry to disappear

But, baby, this is where I fade out
Yeah, this is where I fade out
You'll get over it
I never wanna give out fake love
Nothing you can say when my mind's made up
So I fade out

Don't pretend that you wanna hear all the reasons I'm not into you
I can let it all out, but I don't see how that would feel good to you
You don't really want closure, nah
You just want me to come over one more time
And honestly that's not gonna change a thing

So this is where I fade out
Yeah, this is where I fade out

Sorry to disappear
But I know that I can't say what you want to hear
You'll get over it
I never wanna give out fake love
Nothing you can say when my mind's made up

I never wanna give out fake love
Nothing you can say when my mind's made up

You think I'll come down with a case of regret
But I trust my gut and it ain't let me down yet
So why we gotta have an awkward moment?
I already know where this is going
I ain't gonna change my mind, change my mind

But, baby, this is where I fade out

No Man's Land,226,Marshmello,"When we were young, we had it rough
Short on money, short on love
That's how the wayside takes
The wayside keeps its ghosts
Thick as thieves, my fears and me
We've been wrong and now ten years deep
That's how the wayside takes
And it keeps a hold on me
Oh, I'm living in a no man's land
Nowhere land, no place left to go
When I'm running from myself
I'm holding on to hope
And struggling to cope
And there's places I can't leave
And they're leaving a mark on me
So I'm living in a no man's land
Everywhere I go, I'm running from myself
Right age, wrong crowd
Blamed it all on my hometown
But it wasn't them
They never let me down
No, it was me
I drank, I smoked
I held it in until I choked
Still, these roots are wrapped around my feet
Oh, I'm living in a no man's land
Nowhere land, no place left to go
When I'm running from myself
I'm holding on to hope
And struggling to cope
And there's places I can't leave
And they're leaving a mark on me
So I'm living in a no man's land
Everywhere I go, I'm running from myself
(I'm living in a no man's land)
(I'm living in a no man's land)
And there's places I can't leave
When they're leaving a mark on me
So I'm living in a no man's land
Everywhere I go, I'm running from myself"

Don't Leave Me Lonely,396,Clean Bandit,"You said that you’d never
Forget me,
how you could leave me behind?
Promise me you’ll be there,
For the good and there
for the darkest nights!
You said you’d
swim the deepest oceans,
Rip the stars right from the sky!
You said that you’d never
Forget me,
We’d have each other for life.
I could paint over the scars,
Take an arrow to the heart,
No I don’t care where you’ve been,
Just don’t leave me lonely again!
I could learn to picture you
From a different point of view,
No I don’t care where you’ve been,
Just don’t leave me lonely again!
Don’t leave me lonely!
You are my oxygen,
But somehow you still make me
forget to breath!
I’d go through hell again
For you,
coz it feels like heaven to me.
I’d crush diamonds,
Run from sirens,
Be the world beneath your feet!
Oh you said that
you’d never forget me
I’m yours for eternity.
I could paint over the scars,
Take an arrow to the heart,
No I don’t care where you’ve been,
Just don’t leave me lonely again!

And I lie awake and miss you

safe and soundly
But I`ll miss your arms around me
I`d send a postcard to you dear
`Cause I wish you were here
I`ll watch the night
turn light blue
But it`s not the same without you
Because it takes two
to whisper quietly
The silence isn`t so bad
Till I look at my hands
and feel sad
`Cause the spaces
between my fingers
Are right where
yours fit perfectly
I`ll find repose in new ways
Though I haven`t slept in two days
`Cause cold nostalgia chills me
to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I`ll sit on the front porch
all night
Waist-deep in thought because
when I think of you
I don`t feel so alone
I don`t feel so alone
I don`t feel so alone
As many times as I blink
I`ll think of you tonight
I`ll think of you tonight
When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I`ll taste the sky
and feel alive again
And I`ll forget the world
that I knew
But I swear I won`t forget you
Oh if my voice could reach back
through the past
I`d whisper in your ear
Oh darling I wish you were here"

In a world with everything

Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we have cried

One More Time,37,Felkee,"Oh I miss the way you felt
Close in the morning
The way i could breathe you in
Your little snorting
Oh I don't wanna let go
We made the bars our home
Down in the corner
Memories are froze
I never wanna
forget and have to let go
We were royalty
Working on the streets
With you next to me
Never meant to live
Why can't we just go back
To the days
Where we had life we could waste
We stayed up all night all night
Let's do it one more time
Why can't we just go back
To the days
Where we had life we could waste
We stayed up all night all night
Let's do it one more time
Racing will beat the clock
We're getting older
Something that we can't stop
Weight on my shoulders
I don't wanna let go
Pictures and polaroids
Hung on the window
Games that you'd avoid
But I let you win tho
Cause I don't wanna let go
We were royalty
Working on the streets
With you next to me
Never meant to live
Why can't we just go back
To the days
Where we had life we could waste
We stayed up all night all night
Let's do it one more time
Why can't we just go back
To the days
Where we had life we could waste

And friendships only pass by
Show up gone like strobe lights
But with you I feel something real
And I'd walk a million miles

How could I have let you go
Cutting corners turning stones
But I can only see your ghost
I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up gone like strobe lights
But with you I feel something real
And I'd walk a million miles

don't be in such a hurry

You used to tell me
not to dream away
Go chase the safety

is a world away
I think you worry way
too much
Level up
Light glows from my soul
and my skeleton
Better work better play
find some better love
Gotta dive headfirst
can't be scared of love
You shine you a diamond
when pressure come
Yeah we ain't sweating none
We the one proposing the toast
all in the restaurant
When you make it this far
is it ever done
Good news
the best is yet to come
Big dreams and bright lights
Long days and fast nights
Chasing what I like
Here is to the good life

Grip,"4,789",Seeb,"As the night time bleeds into the day
Tomorrow spills across the sky
And the sun’s a harsh reminder why
We are feeling barely human

We don’t know what’s good for us
'Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won’t discover ‘til we push it

I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
When I should call it a day and make my way
Oh, it grips me
'Cause the devil’s got my arms
('Cause the devil's got my arms)
And it pulls me back into the night
When I should just walk away, away
Oh, it grips me
'Cause the devil’s got my arms
'Cause the devil's got my arms
And it pulls me back into the night

We got drunk on this unholy wine
To deliver us from our old minds
The promise of a better time
'Til we’re feeling barely human

We don’t know what’s good for us
'Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?

Hot Air Balloon (쌍용자동차 CF 삽입 곡),"8,242",Owl City,"We wrote a prelude
to our own fairytale
And bought a parachute
at a church rummage sale
And with a mean sewing machine
and miles of thread
We sewed the day above LA
in navy and red
We round a racetrack
through your mom's kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back
down your dark basement stairs
I lit a match and let it catch
to light up the room
And then you yelled as we beheld
an old maroon
Hot air balloon
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out
of ideas pretty soon
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch
the tree tops over town
I can't wait to kiss the ground
wherever we touch back down
We drank the Great Lakes
like cold lemonade
And both got stomach aches
sprawled out in the shade
So bored to death you
held your breath
and I tried not to yawn
You make my frown turn upside down
and now my worries are gone
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out
of ideas pretty soon
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch
the tree tops over town
I can't wait to kiss the ground
wherever we touch back down
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out
of ideas pretty soon
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch
the tree tops over town
I can't wait to kiss the ground
wherever we touch back down"
The Nights (Felix Jaehn Remix),"1,294",Avicii,"once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father he told me
Son dont let it slip away
He took me in his arms I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever youre afraid
He said
One day youll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they cant put out
Carve their name into those shinning stars
He said Go adventure far beyond these shores
Dont forsake this life of yours
Ill guide you home no matter where you are
One day my father he told me
Son dont let this slip away
When I was just a kid I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever youre afraid
He said
One day youll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

But nothing can beat you
Try to convince myself that

You leave the door open
for me to come back at anytime

I would just leave you every night
And I didn’t call you
Back when you were mine
I know I deserve to be alone ohohoh
Cause I fucked it up
when we were young
So give me another chance
I’ll run to you like you ring for me
Back when you were mine

I’m changing now ohohoh

throw your life around
if you take it slow that
I will run to you like you ring for me

When you were mine mine mine mine
I’ve been damaged
And I know I got some work to do
Sweep out the ashes
Planting new seeds and
hope they’ll bloom
I promise you better
Than when you were mine
I know I deserve to be alone ohohoh

Nightlight,"2,475",ILLENIUM,"I could run
I could cry I could plead
I could say it's never gonna

enough to give all the love
that I need
But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes
Lead me home
When I don't know
which way is right
Love me when it's hard
I promise that I'm not
Leaving from your side
And when I fall apart

in the darkness
Know that I can find my way
Even on the days when it's hardest
But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes

100 Degrees (Feat. Quinn XCII),"1,990",KOLAJ,"You somehow get me riled up
And press my buttons 'til they come off
I spit back, fire burning in my lungs
And then we smoke to forget it all

But I cannot get enough
Your body's a perfect vacation and you know
That I can't stay mad at ya
We just take a break and get back at it

You turn a breeze to 100 degrees
Oh, I never keep cool when you bring that heat
That fire, that fire

You try my patience like a glove
I can't bite fingers when you fucked up
Then you lift my body in the air
I melt to drops and forget to care

But I cannot get enough
Your body's a perfect vacation and you know
That I can't stay mad at ya
We just take a break and get back at it

You turn a breeze to 100 degrees
Oh, I never keep cool when you bring that heat
That fire, that fire

Ooh, the way up, the way up
Ooh, the way up, the way up

Break down my sin, break down my lies
Right now I need your skin all up on mine
Right now, baby, I know you're acting wild
Somehow, I'm still a child when you walk into the room
Trying to keep my mind still, been fighting this all day
But in the night, we feel a rush, your energy's my wave
It's dangerous emotion like playing with those flames
But underneath this fire is where we stay

You turn a breeze to 100 degrees
Oh, I'll never keep cool when you bring that heat
That fire

Ooh, the way up, the way up
It's dangerous emotion
Ooh, the way up, the way up"

Said that you were fine with my mistakes
Now we're tryin to call on yesterday to go back

The bright blessed days,
the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
saying, How do you do
They're really saying, I love you
I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know

I try to hold it together
But once it gets bad
It ain't getting better
Was holding on hope forever
But once it gets bad
No, it ain't getting better

She's so nice, she's a go-getter
So go get her

But I miss you and a messy life


I try to hold it together
But once it gets bad
It ain't getting better
Was holding on hope forever
But once it gets bad
No, it ain't getting better

tell me where you've been

Counting in the dark
I feel at home
I see you light up the sky
a dance in the night Aurora

To a light in the sky
a dance in the night Aurora

like a secret hidden
in an emerald sea
And I'm drowning
in your green eyes
got that power over me
If I told you how I really feel
would you let me in
Would you tell me
all your secrets
tell me where you've been

I know that love is so unforgiving
You've been a victim too many times
And I'll be the friend
hold you together
I'll be forever

Tryna find the answer to the question

Dancing in the rain
Let the sunshine through to lift
your spirit once again

Chasing after rainbows
Somewhere in the sky

Riding on the river
Of hearts that beat as one
This feels like forever
and we've only just begun
Cause love makes the world feel good
Holding on the memories
Cause smiles are still alive
Looking to the future
and there's happiness in sight
Cause love makes the world feel good
Walking through my past life
With a desert full of joy
And it feels so good

Parade,"2,786",Vinai,"I gave you the keys to my door

was you asking for more
Loosing all of me
in a labyrinth of you
There's nothing that your smoke
and your mirrors won't do
Woah-oh woah-oh
It's like you only love
one half of me
When before I was straight
on the phone
But you can't even say my name
when we're alone
Take me places only we're allowed
You only love me
when the lights go out
I know that you're tryin'
to hide away
But you find me dancin'
on my own parade
So don't turn me down
show me that you love me
Don't turn me down
show me that you love me
I know that you're tryin'
to hide away
But I'll be dancin'
on my own parade
No rules in this love affair
But when it's time to play
you don't act like you care
Said baby you're my only poor
judges me
But I seem to be a blank page
in your diary
Woah-oh find me dancin' on my own
Won't you find a way to show love
Woah-oh find a way to show love
Take me places only we're allowed
You only love me

Rebirth (Feat. Ashley Apollodor),888,Rezonate,"Spread your wings to the night
Observe as flames fill the sky
It's just your frame of mind
Strike the match, ignite your life

Spread your wings in the night
Anticipate the lonely roads
Expand your frame of mind
Don't ever lose your soul

Find your harmony
Dissonance within your voice
When you smile, you burn
Down absent walls in your mind
Happiness is all I really need

Don't fear the darkness
It's your light that shines so brightly

Can't hold you back
From destiny
It's your time now
Set yourself free
Can't hold you back

From destiny
It's your time now

Take us up above the clouds
Shelter me under your wing

And it's more simple than you thought
And reflects your company

Storms approaching
I seal the dark within your eyes
Then you shine a smile and whisper
""It's alright""

Happiness is all I really need
Keep my soul full
And wear my heart up on my sleeve

Can't escape it
No I can't outpace it
Get strayed off of the path
You've flown so far
Instead of your last dance
Take a second chance
Rebirth is waiting for you
Ignite your life

Can't hold you back
From destiny
It's your time now
Set yourself free
Can't hold you back
From destiny
It's your time now

Look back upon the night
It's always dark before the dawn
So simple, now you see?
Strike the match to set you free"

Hoping we’ll gonna be alright
Don’t know where our feelings hide
Someone please just shed a light
You’re spinning though
my mind like a hurricane
Calling out your name in the heavy rain
Blowing through my mind
like a hurricane
I am loosing faith in the heavy rain Oh
You calling feel my mind
like a hurricane
I don’t beg you to call back
There’s no rewind
I’m asking myself
will our stars re-align
You said I should move on
and keep out the ghosts
Get out of this danger zone
I’m counting 1 2 3 4 5
Hoping we’ll gonna be alright
Don’t know where our feelings hide

World We Used To Know,"1,717",Alan Walker,"Wild wild wild horses tell me
Where did they all go
They used to run used to run
used to run right here
And all I see is an empty road
Wild wild wild roses tell me
Where did they all go
When I was young I was young
they would spread like fire
And now the roots
don't know where to grow
Did it come overnight
or did it come on slow
It's out of our hands
and it's out of control
I don't think that this is the world
we used to know
Is the world we used to know
White white white oceans tell me
Where do you lead
When the sun and the sky
come to meet at night
I wonder would you carry me
Why won't you tell me
If I'm on my own
You used to be used to be
used to be right here
And now I don't know where to go
Did it come overnight
or did it come on slow
It's out of our hands and
it's out of control
I don't think that this is the world
we used to know
Is the world we used to know
I could show you places that we had
In the world we used to know
Take me home and
show me love can last
There's a world we used to know
Did it come overnight

You knew I wasn't good for you
But you swore you hit the jackpot
And you swore you struck gold
You were stepping on your toes
Always tripping over nothing
But nothing's on the floor
I swear the time it takes
To congregate and conversate
Just so things don't complicate
I just don't have the time of day
To try to pay attention to
what your momma say
She just moving lips moving lips
Talking 'bout stupid shit

And she don't know
how to keep the man
But she can move them hips

And you really know already
what I'm gonna drop
Hella money mami
wanna come up to the top
I walk a little closer then I do
my Diddy bop
I love the way she moving and
the way she make it pop
And I'm loving the way that
you're making it bounce and
you're moving it doing it
See the way that you're breaking
it down and the way you got them
all losing it
Get it lit shake it shake it
Bounce turn up level level
Do it nasty like you out here

On your lips, I could taste it
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend

With you 'til 6:00 in the morning

If I could just...

I'm trying to lock your love down
Just give me one shot: I won't waste it now

Chorus
Friday night, we were faded
On your lips, I could taste it
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
Saturday, I was all in
With you 'til 6:00 in the morning
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend

Post-Chorus
One more weekend
If I could just...
One more weekend

Bridge
If I could just, oh...
Fell so deep, it went so fast though
Still thinking about when time froze
I won't waste it now
Moon sank just outside your window
You come back I'll never let go
I won't waste it now

Chorus
Friday night, we were faded
On your lips, I could taste it
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
Saturday, I was all in
With you 'til 6:00 in the morning
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend

Post-Chorus
One more weekend
If I could just...
One more weekend"
Hungry Heart ft. Hayley Kiyoko,301,Steve Aoki,"You thought we couldn't be
friends in the morning
After we stayed up till
six in the morning
I knew what I wanted, yeah
It was you that I wanted
You, you make me feel like
I’m finally okay
All of the colors,
they mourn when you hold me
Running together
We're better together (Ooh)
Daylight to the moonlight
to the sunrise to the water
Dark nights and the hard times
only make me want you more
Want you more
Yeah, you always leave me
with a hungry heart
'Cause all I think about is,
think about is you
Every time you leave,
I always fall apart
’Cause all I think about is,
think about is you, ooh
Got me swimming in
your blue eyes (Eyes, eyes)
You got me wishing just for one night
Yeah, I got a hungry heart,
hungry heart (Heart, heart, heart)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Hey, hungry
Yeah, I got a hungry heart,

No, I make everything so complicated
I put it on you,
I don't know how to take it
Whenever I'm with you, yeah
I already miss you
Daylight to the moonlight
to the sunrise to the water
Dark nights and the hard times
only make me want you more
Want you more
Yeah, you always leave me

Someone To Hold On To,21,Sigma,"Space and time collide, we're roses in the storm
Lightning clouds bursting around us till the dawn
Thousand times I've been wild,

When the day fades and the night falls
When we dive into a dream world
And the high times, they're just so close
But they don't work when we're all alone


If you need, I can be
Someone to hold on to
And I'll be here when you need
Someone to hold on to
All we got, you and me
Someone to hold on to
Yeah, I'll be there when you need
Someone to hold on to

thinking 'bout each other

I swore it would never
come to this, no
'Cause as soon as we met
I knew it was it
Laying by your side
a perfect fit, yeah
The perfume on your neck
I still smell in my bed
I know I've seen better days
I hate that you're the one
to thank
It kills me
thinking 'bout your face
It's true, oh
I tell myself I'm moving on
Been telling myself for way
too long

Like a ghost inside, sleepwalking in the darkness
When you're lost, I'm here
And I wake you up and hold you when your world shakes

If you're losing your way, feel like tumbling down
Slipping away, I will turn you around
Learning how to navigate my heart
And we're starting our fire and never look back
Taking our chance, bet I'm counting on luck
Learning how to navigate my heart

How we so, chasing gold
Me and you, unique, unique
How we so, anywhere we go
Me and you, unique, unique
Unique, unique

Let the world be gone
Sail away with me forever, start tonight
Let the road lead on
Glorious, beautiful, magical

If you're losing your way, feel like tumbling down
Slipping away, I will turn you around
Learning how to navigate my heart
And we're starting off flying and never look back
Taking our chance, bet I'm counting on luck
Learning how to navigate my heart

Say those words you don't believe
You turn around and look at me
I still got far to go
You're hanging on to hope
So good that I don't deserve it
So close that it's almost perfect
To be lying in your arms
Even though I broke your heart
So high for the chance to fix this
I’m wrapped up
in your forgiveness
And without you I am nothing
But I feel like somebody with you
Somebody with you

And without you I am nothing

Looking for ways we can repair
Out of the certain

Tres dos uno
Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there and
my blood ran cold
Take me back to
that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young didn't know 'bout love
You were wild
couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go
Find me in another
place and time
If only if only you were mine
But I'm already
someone else's baby
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through
the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's
C'mon
Baby ahh
Baby ahh
Baby ahh
But I'm already someone else's
All caught up in the way we were
I feel your hands
getting close to mine
Don't say the words
that I love to hear
The beat goes on and
I close my eyes
I was young didn't know 'bout love
You were wild couldn't get enough
Let's leave things the way they were
You'll stay with me like a lullaby
Hey
Se que te gusto a ti todavia
por mucho que digas
Ademas puedo ver en tus
ojos que no solo quieres
quedar como amigos
Tienes mi corazon
eres mi obsesion
Soy tuyo pa' siempre
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through
the cracks in my hands
Tell myself be stronger
My heart's like a rubber band
And it's such a shame
You'll always be the
one who got away
We both know that deep down
you feel the same
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's
C'mon
Baby ahh
Eso no eso no
Baby ahh
Mereces mejor
Baby ahh
Quiero tu calor
I'm already someone else's
Wish I met you at another
place and time
If only if only you were mine
This love story ends for you and I

Lo que tienes
con el no es amor no

Know how to move
Tell you the truth

Remember how
Everything was so
Beautiful

I miss the old days
When the skies were blue
I miss the long nights
Staying up with u
I miss the summer
Cuz we were in it together

I miss my hometown
Dont you miss it it too-
Driving to nowhere
nothin else to do
I miss the old days
I Wish they lasted forever

When we were young, it seemed that life was so wonderful

Remember how
Everything was so

When we were young It seemed that life was So simple then
So innocent
Infinite

It’s so different
Isn’t it?

The Hair across ur face
The little moments
Before we moved away
And Looking back now
We should have stayed there forever

at twenty-three
She left her body
and hovered above me
I saw no shadow, I looked around
Searched every building
and home that I found
I saw no shadow, but felt a glow
The warmth inside me,
it kept me afloat
I felt like heaven,
had found my bones
And gave me comfort
when I feel alone
Now you're gone, I moved on
I guess it's time to get better
Through the pain I will go alone
If I fall, break my bones
I will scream even louder
'Cause I'm not dying alone
I lost my best friend
at twenty-three
She left her body
and hovered above me
I lost my best friend
at twenty-three
I heard the heavens
crying above me
They gained an angel,
I lost a friend
I felt like dying again and again
I went through hell,
I stared at death
But I keep fighting
with each living breath
I saw my way out from
where I stood
Felt like the fire had burnt me
for good
Now you're gone, I moved on
I guess it's time to get better
Through the pain I will go alone
If I fall, break my bones
I will scream even louder
'Cause I'm not dying alone

To you
Why I should give my love, my love
My love to you

My love, my love to you
My love, my love to you

Feeling drama free, keep your distance
Cuz I ain't got no time for your messes
You keep telling me you're so different
Why don't you come show me
I hope you don't take this personal
There's one thing I need you to know
If it ain't drama free, get that away from me

I swear I heard it all before
You say that you wanna love me
Be by my side and you'll never leave me
I ain't sayin you lying but I just don't trust it
So give me a reason why I should give my love
To you
Why I should give my love, my love
My love to you

My love, my love to you

You say that you wanna love me
Be by my side and you'll never leave me
Not saying you lying but I just don't trust it
My love, my love to you"

I never thought it’d be this
I’m jumpin' out of your arms
I land and fall in a pit
Is this what they call the abyss
I fought and clawed for an inch
Turned into miracle mile
I can recall when your lips
Used to contort into smiles
Bright as the sun
that’s drawn an eclipse
I haven’t seen light in awhile
Hasn’t been bright in awhile

Clarity
A testament to your character

On your birthday you told me
to donate money to charity
You are made of sincerity
'cerity
And got cake like Sara Lee
You tether me
when my stress start burying me
You are the one to take care of me
I’m so gone
that conclusion foregone
that confuse you
I'm weary of war zones
this tour long
I’m ready to go home
I’m ready for your bed
Can you comb my hair Oh
so it don’t dread
I just want my head rubbed
I don’t want a mixtape
I just want the best of
I just wanna get grub
from our spot again

Stay down escape town
Head low and face down

Doing God’s work
in the devil's playground

Hot as napalm
Next day come the rain

Press play
put my heart in all of these songs
Display all of these wrongs yeah
a part of me is gone
You are a gift in itself
A measure of wealth
The meaning of selfless
I place you over the shelf
and higher than pedestals
Over the belt

on Orion’s constellation
Observation of you
Here come the truth

Dive (Feat. Chris James),706,Hot Shade,"From the small things

To the roadblocks that we had to face
There's no moment I'd ever replace
'Cause it made us what we are
All the days, all the nights
I'll be by your side
No, we don't have to rush
We can take our time
If you feel kinda lost
I'll be your light
We can leave this world behind,
you and I
I don't care what we call home
If you dive, I will follow
Through the fire and the smoke
If you dive, I will follow
If you dive, I will follow
If you dive, I will follow
From the small fights
'bout nothing at all
To the tough times when we hit a wall
There's no moment that I can recall
That I didn't wanna stay
Mmh, all the days, all the nights
I'll be by your side
No, we don't have to rush
We can take our time
If you feel kinda lost

Baby I'm Yours (Feat. Irfane),"3,033",Breakbot,"I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray
The day you walked away
You were the clock
that was ticking in my home
Changed my state of mind
But love's so hard to find
Your feelings changed
like the weather
Went from clear to grey
On that cloudy day
How can I go on
without falling apart
Love's so hard to find
When someone's on your mind
Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
What can I do to
make my baby understand
Something tells me
that I'm dreaming
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that
have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds
You need someone
you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to
heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

Waiting for daylight

I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed
and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall

Just know you might think
you're dying but you won't

something out of you
But when you think
of giving up don't
Bang your head against the wall
You may feel light headed
But you won't crawl no
you won't fall
You will rise above it all
You'll find
what you're searching for

You think you're gonna
hit the floor
Instead you rise above it all

To say what's been on my mind
You got it right
There's nothing more
You give me chills all the time
There goes all those butterflies

Every time we dance in my garden
I say damn that's wild

Never Growing Up,"1,137",Mathieu Koss,"I watched the sun come up
in every city
Round the world
so young and so free
All those beautiful faces stay with me
Deep in my heart a strong memory
Now let's go back to that
playground and remember when
We raced through the days
just to blaze with our friends
Let's vibe out on good times
with wine in our cups
We may be getting older
but we ain't never growing up
We ain't never growing up
We ain't never growing up
oh oh oh way oh
We ain't never
We may be getting older
but we ain't never growing up
I watch the moon hang high
above my city
This is my home
where I know that I'm free
Tried to move
had to lose my self pity
But now I'm back where I can be me
Now let's go back to that
playground and remember when
We raced through the days
just to blaze with our friends
Let's vibe out on good times

I'm Done,458,Aeden,"I'm so sick of your sad excuses
Just wish you could you look at me and say you're sorry
That's all that I need from you
But your ego's inflating, taking the vacancies
And slowly suffocating me, yeah honestly
It's been 6 months and I'm starting to feel like
I've grown up more than ever without you judging my life
Cause for the first time
Oh I'm not afraid to cut you out and say
I'm done
Getting blamed for all the selfish things you've done
Feeling guilty for no reason till I'm numb
I had to unlearn what it meant to love someone
Cause you messed me up
And I'm done
I was so young, didn't know any different
Just thought maybe that's what love's supposed to feel like
So I closed my eyes
While you'd manipulate my feelings
Build a cathedral out of all my insecurities
So I'd feel weak
I wish I could go back in time and tell myself that
Sometimes it's better just to be lonely
Than to let someone walk all over me
But oh, I'm gonna finally stand up for myself and say
I'm done
Getting blamed for all the selfish things you've done
Feeling guilty over nothing till I'm numb
I had to unlearn what it meant to love someone
Cause you messed me up
Yeah I'm done
Holding all my anger like a loaded gun
Counting all the times you told me I was wrong
You taught me I should hate who I've become
But I'm rising up
And I'm done"

Discord,992,The Living Tombstone,"Verse 1
I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I've a nagging fear
Someone else is pulling at the strings
Something terrible is going down through the entire town
Wreaking anarchy and all it brings

Pre-Chorus
I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
I curse the name, the one behind it all

Chorus
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne
Discord, we won't take it anymore
So take your tyranny away

Post-Chorus
Discord
Discord

Verse 2
I'm fine with changing status quo, but not in letting go
Now the world is being torn apart
A terrible catastrophe played by your symphony
What a terrifying work of art

Pre-Chorus
I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
I curse the name, the one behind it all

Chorus
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne
Discord, we won't take it anymore
So take your tyranny away

And I am trying not to drown
Fell in deeper this time

And doubt creeps into my soul
And now I've found there's
nothing left to hold
Tonight I feel like

yeah you're my oasis
I thought I'd die
I had no fight I had given up
Thought I was done
I was savaged by the sun
I thought I'd die
I had no fight I had turned to dust
When I came to in your arms
I knew I would make it through
Tonight I feel like

Where are you now
These shallow waters never met
what I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire

You pour it on me
slipping into desire
Whatever happens feed the fire"

'Cause a little bit sooner turned into a lot
There's no way
I'll be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything
that I thought I was not
Tell me tell me ay ay ay
Oh mama hola hola hola
Don't know what this is
What do I do now do now do now
Do with all of this
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama hola hola hola
Oh what do I do now
Everything I thought I knew
about me's upside down
Everything is changing
but I think I love it now ay ay ay
Oh mama hola hola hola
Don't know what this is
What do I do now do now do now
Do with all of this
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama hola hola hola
Oh what do I do now

No Sleep (feat. Bonn),"5,988",Martin Garrix,"Summer nights all align
As we drown in the moonlight
We collide in plain sight
Yeah I know we'll be alright
And we come alive
we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end
we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild
enjoy the ride we made it
We made it
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming
already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling
I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming
already dreaming
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming
already dreaming
Wide awake no time to waste
Make a mark on my timeline
We're safe and sound
we come around
We are dancing the sun down
And we come alive
we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end
we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild
enjoy the ride we made it
We made it
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming
already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling
I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming

Oh I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming

Oh I don't need no sleep

Young,229,Skye Holland,"We were dumb
Using our fake ids to
Fall in love
And we had dreams that we would
Drive our way to LA
And we all wanna do is
Ride along to our favourite song
And be forever young
Empty bottles and cigarettes
Drink on the bleachers
In the morning we forget
End up at the beach
And then we do it all again
With our parents liquor
And a shot glass from Amsterdam
We were young
And dumb and stupid
Trying to live everyday
like its our last
We were young
And had no worries
We promised that one day
we would go back
So lets do it again
Chase the sun
Sneaking out of the house to
Fall in love
We thought we knew it all bump
M.I.A. with paper planes
And we all wanna do is
Ride along until were gone
And be forever young
Empty bottles and cigarettes
Drink on the bleachers
In the morning we forget
End up at the beach
And then we do it all again
With our parents liquor
And a shot glass from Amsterdam
We were young
And dumb and stupid
Trying to live everyday
like its our last
We were young
And had no worries
We promised that one day
we would go back
So lets do it again
Wanna go back wanna go back
wanna go back to
you and i
Wanna go back wanna go back
wanna hold you
Wanna go back wanna go back
wanna go back to
you and i
Wanna go back wanna go back
to that night
So lets do it again"
One More,990,SG Lewis,"I know you can't stay here forever
I know you've got friends
in the bathroom stall
Been wanna do this since I met you
Can we just stay here for one
You'll just get distracted
and see someone you know
I'll be waiting getting
impatient all alone
Go out on the balcony
Light myself a smoke
Start talking to someone
that I don't even know
They just might invite me
to see another spot
You'll be trying to find me
again but I'll be gone
We'll forget each other
The night will carry on
But that don't have to happen
And that's not what I want cos
I know you can't stay here forever
I know you've got friends
in the bathroom stall
Been wanna do this since I met you
Can we just stay here
for one more song
If you leave now might forget you
The Memory fades
when I'm way too gone
Was hoping we'd wake up together
Maybe just stay here
for one more song
Maybe just stay here
for one more song
Now imagine that you stay
and we just keep it going
Just another couple minutes
in the vibe we're on
Then I'll come with you
where you're going
and we'll both take one
Feeling rushing over both of us
So we'll go out on the balcony
Light ourselves a smoke
Start talking to people
that we don't even know
Maybe call a taxi
to hit another spot
But this time you'll be with me
And yeah that's what I want cos
I know you can't stay here forever
I know you got friends
in the bathroom stall
Been wanna do this since I met you
Can we just stay here
for one more song
If you leave now might forget you
The memory fades
when I'm way too gone
Was hoping we'd wake up together
Maybe just stay here
for one more song
I know you can't stay forever
Maybe just stay here
for one more song"
You Don't Ignore (Too Late),24,Petit Biscuit,"You enflame me
Waiting for me to cross the line
You seem so terrified
As time moves on

Trying not to jump the gun
We both know it’s a lost cause

‘Cause you don’t ignore that it’s not
Too late for these temptations
Too late for me to find a reason
To stop you
Gazing into
My eyes, watching you
It’s too late for me to renounce
Too late for me to cool it down

When we’re out at night, you’re playing hard, what is there to prove?
Misleading moves
It’s approved
I don’t know what’s missing
I give up trying to keep control

‘Cause you don’t ignore that it’s not
Too late for these temptations
Too late for me to find a reason
To stop you
Gazing into
My eyes, watching you
It’s too late for me to renounce
Too late for me to cool it down

It’s not too late for these temptations
Too late for me to find a reason
To stop you
Gazing into
My eyes, watching you
It’s too late for me to renounce
Too late for me to cool it down"

All that I'm asking for

Am I talking to myself again
And I know you don't owe me your love

don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you
Don't leave me here in the dark

Save Me (Feat. Kiddo A.I.),573,Lost Kings,"I got a new break
Packed all my old shit
Back at my mom's house
Down in the basement
I'm feeling good now
And that's a statement
I know you're cold now
Can't be your blanket
But if I called you in the middle
of the night
Would you pick up
Would you even think
twice or think I'm crazy
Tell me would you save me
If I called you and
I asked you for a ride
Would you show up?
Would you even think
twice or think I'm crazy?
Would you show up?
Would you save me?
'Cause these nights are
something else that I never felt
And when I look in the mirror,
I don't see myself
I go back in time to realize
I wasn't ready for us
We weren't ready for love
We're running on empty,
left my heart on the shelf
And sometimes I think of you,
but I never tell
Can't give up my pride to realize
I wasn't ready for us
We weren't ready for love
But if I called you in the middle
of the night
Would you pick up?
Would you even think twice
or think I'm crazy?
Tell me would you save me?
If I called you and
I asked you for a ride
Would you show up?
Would you even think
twice or think I'm crazy?
Would you show up?
Would you save me?"

Fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less

Is you out with her?

Drop them drawers, give me what I want

Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2]
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them
More of them, more of you on me
On us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door
Ready to take her place
Ready to give you
What you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

Wash Away (Feat. Weldon),"1,197",Junkilla,"I feel the sun
Shining down on me
Soaking in the summertime heat
I’m on the run
Searching for a dream
Floating like a bottle at sea
On the golden road
Where everybody goes
To find a little peace
in the breeze
Up and down the coast
Where everything unfolds
Never wanna leave when I see
The breaking of waves
The sand on the bay
Enough clarity for me to stay
And all I can do
Is stare at the views
While I watch my worries
Wash away
Watch them wash away-ay-ay-ay-ay
Wash away
I wanna stay
Today and everyday
Sit and watch the worries wash away
Hands on the clock
Slowing down for me
Making time for memories
Captured in thought
Holding on to peace
If I could then I would
never leave
The breaking of waves
The sand on the bay
Enough clarity for me to stay
And all I can do
Is stare at the views
While I watch my worries
Wash away
Watch them wash away-ay-ay-ay-ay
Wash away
I wanna stay
Today and everyday
Sit and watch the worries wash away
On the golden road
Where everybody goes
To find a little peace
in the breeze
Up and down the coast
Where everything unfolds
Never wanna leave when I see
I don’t wanna leave
I don’t wanna be anywhere
but where I am right now
Cause where I am right now
I’ve got everything
Like the breaking of waves
The sand on the bay
Oh I wanna stay
The breaking of waves
The sand on the bay
Enough clarity for me to stay
And all I can do
Is stare at the views
While I watch my worries

Watch them wash away-ay-ay-ay-ay
Wash away

Sit and watch the worries wash away"
Yesterday,216,Alan Walker,"Held your hand in a dream I had in New York
But I never turned around to see your face
Two drunk kids on a boulevard
You faded
Woke up to another empty bed
Now I'm choking
No one knows how I feel
Now you're gone
I don't know what's real
I close my eyes and make tomorrow yesterday
I miss your smile like the deserts miss the rain
10,000 tears but you would dry them all away
If I could make tomorrow yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday
We'd head west in a car we can't afford yeah
Flaming lips looking at the stars just friends
I watch the moonlight dancing on, on the water
'Cause I see your face in everything
Now I'm choking
No one knows how I feel
Now you're gone
I don't know what's real
I close my eyes and make tomorrow yesterday
I miss your smile like the deserts miss the rain
10,000 tears but you would dry them all away
If I could make tomorrow yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday
Now I'm choking
No one knows how I feel
Now you're gone
I don't know what's real"

Remind Me to Forget,"8,034",Kygo,"It never fades away it's staying

holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark
reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are
you can keep my regret
Baby I got these scars
reminding me to forget
Reminding me I got these scars
get your love
Keep reminding me ooh
to forget your love
You left your mark my heart

There's no room
in war for feelings
Hurt me to the core still healing
And I know you're no good for me
So I try to forget the memories

Remember I told you
To save it it's over
And I'll be alright
So hurt me as much as you like
I need you to let go
I got these mementos
And I'll be alright

I Found You,"1,692",Cash Cash,"On the way I was crowned a king

I've been high and I've been low
Played the fool
and the star of the show
Gone along for a wild ride
And I can say lookin' in your eyes
That it all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way
I found cynicism
I found criticism
I've been the zero the hero
And I have been the villain
I lost more than a heart can take
But I found you on the way
I found you I found you

It all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way
But I found you on the way
On the way I was given the keys
To the city they were mine to keep
Over time every lock'll change
But you love me all the same
I found pessimism
I found skepticism
I've been the corner performer
and sung in front of millions
I lost more than a heart can take

closer to an end tonight

like something
from a dream calling to me

to be wasting
I asked if I knew you
'cause I felt a pull
from some greater feeling
You took hold of me in that moment
And I know it's childish
from me to think such things
to say such things
But this really feels
like forever tonight
'Cause I'd walk a million miles
just to know your name
I know you said
you felt love before
this ain't the same
And I can't let you go

Follow my voice like a melody
Meet me outside, side side side
I’ll trade my heart for a dance
Hold you with blood on my hands

Tug on my lip til I’m blue
We love like teenagers do
We’ll never grow up
We’ll never grow up
We’ll never go home
We’ll never grow up
We’ll never grow up
We’ll never go home

I’m drawn to danger
You’re drawn to me
We’re not a love song
More like a high
So mesmerizing
It’s called a crime
Follow my voice like a melody
Meet me outside,
black smoke white teeth
Follow my voice like a melody
Meet me outside, side side side

A past lost in space

The past and the chase
You hunted me down
Like a wolf a predator
I felt like a deer in the lights
You loved me
and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete
with the she wolf
who has brought me to my knees
what do you see
in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
DId she lie and wait
Was i bait to pull you in
The thrill of the kill
You feel as a sin
Alone with the wolves
And now it seems
I thought I was part of you
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete
with the she wolf
who has brought me
to my knees
What do you see

'Cause I've been trapped inside my head for so long
I'm sorry, I should've called when I was sober
Some days, I get scared to be alone

I, I'm blacking out and I can't help it
I, I scream and shout and I can't help it

I can't stand my bedroom, I put blankets on the couch, woah

When everybody's
caught up in the night
Oh darling fall back on me
You can pick it up
and call me down the line
Oh darling fall back on me
These roads they take you on
from where you once belonged
I know your father told you
this is not your home
But oh, I wait here for you
'til the time is gone
You know I'll always be here
if you fall behind
When everybody's

Hanging by the orchards
Sleeping under trees
We ran into the water
My hands around your waist
You were so much harder
I was saying stay
But you just walked away
You just walked away
Yeah you just walked away
Try to hold on to the dream
I'm painting all the scenes
in which I still believe
I found my way back
back to where we came from
To that summer day
when you just walked away
I'll take you to the lakeside

Sleeping under trees
We'll go into the water

I know I'm not there but I'm close
I'll find my way back
to a higher ground
Yeah I just want to feel alive
with you
Yeah I just want to feel alive
with you
Yeah I just want to feel alive
Try to speak
but my voice keeps breaking
Need to say what's wrong
So many smiles
you have seen me faking
On and on
It's been a long time coming
But it wasn't for nothing
Soul searching for something
for something
I'm down on my knees in the dust
I scream from the top of my lungs
I find my way back
to a higher ground
Yeah I just want to feel alive
Deep in my bones
I know I'm not there but I'm close
I'll find my way back
to a higher ground
Yeah I just want to feel alive
with you
Yeah I just want to feel alive
with you
Yeah I just want to feel alive
With you you yeah
I just want to feel alive
With you you yeah
I just want to feel alive with you"
Yellow Lights,634,Harry Hudson,"Don't cut the lights
Just take it slow
We're moving fast
We've lost control
But I feel safe with you
Love is brave
but I've been scared
I look around see no one there
And still feel close to you
'Cause my life is
like a bedroom door
Don't lead me in when you feel low
'Cause I might make a move
So what should I do
in the darkness of you
When you light up my moon
from July until June
What would I do
if there wasn't a you
Would you sing about me
like I sing about you
You're my sunshine
You're my rain
You're all I've lost
Yet all I've gained
If I must tell the truth
Hello darkness goodbye light
I'll kiss you close
and hold you tight
If that's alright with you
I'm coming back
if that's alright with you
So come on back
if that's alright with you
So what should I do
when I'm dark and I'm blue
When you light up my room
from July until June
What would I do
if there wasn't a you
Would you sing about me
like I sing about you
'Cause all I see are
yellow lights yellow lights
yellow lights
Meet me under yellow lights
yellow lights yellow lights
We're burning through these
yellow lights yellow lights
yellow lights
When I'm with you
What should I do
in the darkness of you
When you light up my moon
from July until June
What would you do
if I died before you
Would you sing about me
like I sing about you"
Frontier (Feat. Jasmina Lin & Jay Christopher),"1,750",Krale,"From far away they came
to us with knowledge
They changed our world
then left us without warning
They will return the day
when they are needed
Our gaze is shifted
upwards to the sky
We crave for knowledge
farther than the unknown
Our time has come to find
why we were shown"
Way Back Home,994,Krys Talk,"I can't find my way back to you

God he almost
looks like you in the dark
Sitting in the same corner at the bar
Yeah we took so many shots
we went too hard
God he almost
looks like you in the dark
He ordered a drink
before I could notice
That Jack and Coke
brought us into focus
I took a sip it tasted
just like it used to
It's been a while
since I thought about you
I wouldn't say it sober
But the truth is coming out
I didn't miss you until now until now
In my right mind it's over
But the drinks are talking loud
I didn't miss you until now until now
Being here without you
doesn't feel right
His lips are moving
and I'm tryna be too nice
He's looking at me
but he doesn't have your eyes
Being here without you
doesn't feel right
Your song just came on
and now it feels hopeless
Jukebox is playing
old Guns 'N Roses
I put a dollar in it
just like you used to
It's been a while
since I thought about you
I wouldn't say it sober

I didn't miss you until now until now

Digital Love,"3,794",Daft Punk,"Last night
I had a dream about you
In this dream
I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked
like everyone was having fun
the kind of feeling
I've waited so long
Don't stop come a little closer
As we jam the rythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong
with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long
The time is right
to put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly
I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it
this dream was all gone
Ooh I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true
Ooh I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Different World (feat. CORSAK),"2,560",Alan Walker,"All We know left untold
Beaten by a broken dream
Nothing like what it used to be
We've been chasing our demons
down an empty road
Been watching our castle
turning into dust
Escaping our shadows
just to end up here once more
And we both know
This is not the world
we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers
we can't find
But we got time
And even though
we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us
of a different time
This is not the world
we had in mind
But we got time
Broken smile tired eyes
I can feel your longing heart
Call my name howlin' from afar
We've been fighting our demons
just to stay afloat
Been building our castle
just to watch it fall
Been running forever
just to end up here once more
And now we know
This is not the world
we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers
we can't find
But we got time
And even though
we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us
of a different time
This is not the world
we had in mind
But we got time
Take me back
Back to the mountainside
Under the northern lights
Chasin' the stars
Take me back
Back to the mountainside
When we were full of life
Back to the start
We both know that
This is not the world
we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers
we can't find
But we got time
And even though
we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us

We Got Love (feat. Ella Henderson),"3,209",Sigala,"Mm you can run away from it all

It'll all come back

where we come from
With bottled hopes
and dreams and desires
Must've forgotten that
We got bills to pay
We got rules to break
We got risks to take
We got things to say
No one ever said
It would be okay
But we'll find a way
When there's love
And we got love
Yeah it's okay
'cause we got love

When the world is at your feet
Stay on track

Lost in the days of heartbreak

Without you, I'm just a shade
of someone I used to know

when days turn into weeks
that's one more night without no sleep
tried my best to bridge the distance
but everytime i try, thoughts of you
stay on my mind
i miss the way we used to be
all the little things
baby, can't you see
without you, there ain't no me
i miss the way we used to touch
yearning for your rush

without you there ain't no me

And will you be there in the morning
Do you stay when it all goes
Or will I wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
I don't need cars
I don't need clothes
forget that money

Anh mà không nể em là khi mà anh không hết ly
Uống thêm vài ly để mình chẳng mấy khi vui
Nốc thêm vài chai vì anh em chả mấy khi gặp lại
Nơi đây đang xoay xoay, thế gian đang xoay vòng
Anh đang ở nơi đâu, biết anh có thay lòng?
Đừng nói chi í i i mà
Mình uống đi í i i
Một hai ba bốn hai ba một
Hình như anh nói anh say rồi
Một hai ba bốn hai ba một
Hình như anh nói anh yêu em rồi

I'm pulled in, fucking lot
Wanna watch her make it hot
I do the most, I make a lot
Yeah take it off and make it pop
Shots make the party rock
Rock my ice it don't tell time
Frozen now forever shine
Floating and I'm Hella high.

Bass. Pop. Shake. Twist. Drink. Fetti high

Blow my mind tell me it's mine.
You lie, it's fine.

Giorgio by Moroder,"5,691",Daft Punk,"When I was fifteen sixteen
when I really started
to play the guitar
I definitely wanted
to become a musician
It was almost impossible
because it was
the dream
was so big
That I didn't see any chance
because I was living in a
little town
I was starting and
when I finally broke away
from school and
became musician
I thought
Well Now I may have a
bit of a chance
Because all I ever wanted to do
is music And not only play
music but compose music
At that time
in Germany
in 1969 70
they had already discotheques
So I would take my car
and go to a discotheque
sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about 7 8 songs
I would partially sleep in the car
because I didn't want to
drive home and that helped me
for about almost
two years to survive
In the beginning
I wanted to do an album
with the sounds of the 50s
the sounds of the 60s
of the 70s
and then have a sound
of the future
And I saw wait a second
I know the synthesizer
Why don't I use
the synthesizer
which is the sound of the future
And I didn't have any idea
what to do but
I knew I needed a click
so we put a click on the 24 track
which then was synced
to the moog modular
I knew that it could be a sound
of the future
but I didn't realize
how much impact it would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
but everybody calls me
Giorgio
You want to free your mind
about a concept of harmony
and music being correct
you can do whatever you want
So nobody told me
what to do and
there was no preconception
of what to do"

Tired (Feat. Gavin James) (Kygo Remix),"5,147",Alan Walker,"Cold hands red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
I don't know what came by me
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like
you've lost who you are
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
When you whisper I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could they’d say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like
you've lost who you are
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
I know right now you feel alone
And all the good things
they hurt the most
But it's a long way done
yeah it's a long way down
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired"
Feel Alright (Feat. Guy Sebastian),683,Oliver Nelson,"Open, life is better wide open
Forget the lessons meant to clone us
Rules are better when they're broken
So come on hold on tight
I know you're ready and you know I'm right
Life is better when you don't think twice
Life is better wide open

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I see adventure there in your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
That's why my intention is that we leave this all behind

[Chorus]
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Seeing stars while we dance in the headlights
Don't it feel alright?
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Non stop, running one with the paradise
Gonna be alright

Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Seeing stars while we dance in the headlights
Don't it feel alright?
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Non stop, running one with the paradise
Don't it feel alright?

[Verse 2]
Waking to the joys of misbehaving
You know no second should be wasted
'Cause to keep in check is overrated
So that's why we're breaking out
Ain't nobody gonna hold us down
Tasting life is what we're all about
So let's grab this crazy world and shake it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I see your recklessness in your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
And I know the best of it is you see the same in mine

[Chorus]
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Seeing stars while we dance in the headlights
Don't it feel alright?
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Non stop, running one with the paradise
Don't it feel alright?

Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Seeing stars while we dance in the headlights
Don't it feel alright?
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Don't stop, running one with the paradise
Don't it feel alright?

[Bridge]
If you can we can do it all
I will let you lead the way
(If you can we can do it all)
I know there's no price to pay
(If you can we can do it all)
If you can we can do it all
If you can we can do it all

[Chorus]
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Seeing stars while we dance in the headlights
Don't it feel alright?
Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?
Non stop, running one with the paradise
Gonna be alright

Can you hear, hear it tonight?
Can you hear the freeway calling?

Everything,"1,481",Diamond Eyes,"I'm on my own broke and alone
I feel the rain crashing down
All around this empty town
I'm searching for the lost and found
But you don't care you're unaware
Keep moving like the scars
aren't even there
It's in the air like a prism flare
Just stay cause the flames
will burn us
I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas
Oh you meant the world to me
I used to kiss your head
when you cried for me
Hold your hand
while the pain was all around
Keep you warmed by the roaring sea
Oh you meant the world to me
Oh you meant the world to me
Oh you meant the world to me
My darling dear you're never here
When I'm in pain you
hide and disappear
Like shadows in the atmosphere
Charming the stratosphere yeah
I prayed for you and catch you near
And host you chase away my fears
I'm on my own you made it so
And now I'm chasing nightmares
through your pain
I used to run with you
through the great big leaves
Laugh at you when you laugh at me
Hope for us because I believed
That home was just you and me
I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas
Oh you meant the world to me
Oh you meant the world to me
Oh you meant the world to me
Oh I'm gonna do this on my own
No point in blaming you
you did not know
Ooooh
I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas
Oh you meant the world to me
Oh you meant the world to me
Oh you meant the world to me

Just to have some fun and be no one

One More Time,"1,865",Davai,"We're a train-wreck

You're screaming my name
as I'm leaving again
All the madness
Brings me back to your mattress
I-i-i-i know
I should leave you
I would if I could
But I don't want to
Can we go back one more time
Hold me in your arms tonight
As we fall into the same mistake
Another drunken night
I'm at your place
Can we go back one more time
One more time
Helpless
I tried to get clean
but the way that I'm feeling
Needs warning
You'll always be my fix
You're so selfish
You knew I was here
but you came to this bar
All of my willpower falling apart
I can't help it no no no
I know
I should leave you
I would if I could
But I don't want to

Desperate,98,Neffex,"Got a monster inside of me
You better watch out if you ignite him
He has a got a road ahead, a full prophecy
To be the greatest beast the world has ever seen
I feed him every day, lick the bones clean
I feed him all the hate and he grows mean
He gets claws real big, pissed off quick
And if you cross him you might drop dead
Metaphorically of course, settling the score
Never getting bored, loves the blood and gore
Always wanting more, feed him from the source
They don't really understand until they feel the force
Departed if you start shit, you'll be heartless in the darkness
Torn apart quick, you'll have scars ripped, you'll be chewed up and discarded
And this world ain't right, won't accept it
Negative energy, I expect it
Once it's in your mind it's infectious
So fight for your life and reject it
You better give me space, I'm protective
My adrenaline spikes when I'm aggressive
'Cause when there's no exit, I'll kill when I'm desperate
'Cause when there's no exit, I'll kill when I'm desperate
He's back and better than ever
I can feel my heart rate adrenaline pressure
It's stormy weather, lightning, thunder, pouring. wetter
Yo, I'm a go-getter, try to do it like me but I do it better
I got a mind that's clever, the beast inside is competitive as ever
I'm conscious, my subconscious an accomplice to me
I promise the darkness I can harness, believe
But don't cross me, I might lose control of the lost beast
So he's locked away inside, with the key controlled by fight or flight, oh
And this world ain't right, won't accept it
Negative energy, I expect it
Once it's in your mind it's infectious
So fight for your life and reject it
You better give me space, I'm protective
My adrenaline spikes when I'm threatened
And if you stay in my way I'm aggressive
'Cause when there's no exit, I'll kill when I'm desperate
'Cause when there's no exit, I'll kill when I'm desperate"

Can't Wait (Feat. Anna Yvette),255,Jim Yosef,"If I had known then what I know now
I wouldn't have said what i said
I took the long road thought I'd be better on my own
Sometime what's right is wrong instead
Cause I was too young
And I didn't understand that You were my one
And I can't wait to see you again
I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait
I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait
And I'm just pleading when your heart's bleeding
And all you can see is red
Til you discover it is within each other to forgive and make amends
If I had known then what i know now
I would't have said what I said
I took the long road thought I'd be better on my own
Sometime what's right is wrong instead

Sweet Nothing (Feat. Florence Welch),"3,525",Calvin Harris,"You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hope
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper every sigh
Eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hope
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing

Into The Sunset,734,Mako,"Oh, we don't hit much
Pocket full of holes ain't got no luck
One in every town we've been before
Stealing from the rich but giving more

Oh this is where the legend begins
I think I know the ending for this
And I know it cause

We ride into the sunset like it's the young west
Don't mind lover, reach for the stars
We make out like bandits, dreaming of mansions
Every night you'll sleep in my arms
So darling, ride, ride, ride like the wind
And drive, drive, drive to forget
Our lives might depend on it
Ride into the sunset

Oh, it's all or not
Lovers on the run 'til we get caught
Making a getaway with everything we stole
Pistol on the draw that's hard to show

Cause this is where the legend begins
I think I know the ending for this
And I know it cause

We ride into the sunset like it's the young west
Don't mind lover, reach for the stars
We make out like bandits, dreaming of mansions
Every night you'll sleep in my arms
So darling, ride, ride, ride like the wind
And drive, drive, drive to forget
Our lives might depend on it

I thought of you I can't deny
But the minute that I realized
That you were means to an end
And I wasn't gonna pretend
Then you ran and reappeared
You're no longer just a souvenir
Taking all the words I wanna hear
Your hands wandering in the cab
And now you can't take it back
'Cause we got too much history
And all you wanna do is fuck with me
But we got too much history
Too wake up in my bed
With you lying next to me
With you lying next to me oh-oh
With you lying next to me me
'Cause we got too much history
With you lying next to me
With you lying next to me oh-oh
With you lying next to me me
'Cause we got too much history
Your every wish is my command
With the Gin and tonic in your hand
Only words that me
and you can understand
Pretending that nobody knows
We're already in the cab home
'Cause we got too much history
And all you wanna do is fuck with me
But we got too much history
Too wake up in my bed
With you lying next to me
With you lying next to me oh-oh

I just can't make it up
Making love to you

Don't let it fade, pup

Cuz even when I snap back out of it
I see us from above with clear vision
Now I can't do anything
but fall in love
But fall in love

Get the fever

Tell you everything you're missing
How did she know?
Can't move 'til you pay me

Talking shit from across the club
Wrist watch n**ga try your luck
(Try your luck)
I was feelin' comatose
Nothing makes sense
I hit the floor, then I hit the drink
Caught them all then
I start to think
Gotta figure this out (Figure this out)
Gotta figure this out (Figure this out)
I hit the streets and they show me love
Afterparty from the club

I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in
Holdin' even though
it kills you slowly
Explosions hitting
when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Holdin' even though
it kills you slowly
Arguments that never end
you're talkin' shit
to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
these fights with you are
startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good
for you right
before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
and grab my hand even though
you hate it

Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend

Summer,310,Steve Kroeger,"So they said
You will know
When you fall in love
Don't let it go
Looking back
I already knew
That it felt right
When I met you in the summer
You said lets run away
Let's leave it all behind
And go make some mistakes
We'll get lost in Ibiza
We'll lose track of time
All I need is you
My one ride or die
Fading back
From black and white
These memories
Of you and I
Take me back
To that night
And how it felt
When we were
Coast to coast on adrenaline
Making the most of what we got
And I don't know
if I'll ever forget
That time
When I met you in the summer
You said lets run away
Let's leave it all behind
And go make some mistakes
We'll get lost in Ibiza

Is washed away
All I know

We'd find our way"

City Of Love,347,Surf Mesa,"These streets are full of angels
Big dreams but turning tables
I thought all the distractions
Would cut the attachment
And get me through
Don't wanna be closer to the truth
Don't wanna be reminded of you
There's no space,
there's no room for two
So now I disappear
I'm feeling lonely in the city of love
Thought it'd be different
but it's four million
Try to move on
but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you
All full of strangers,
I got no one to trust
Following footprints
but they turn into dust
Try to move on
but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you
Looks like a simulation
Where everybody's famous
But under the surface
They're hiding, they're hurting,
I got deja vu
Now I'm feeling lonely
in the city of love
Thought it'd be different
but it's four million
Try to move on
but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you
All full of strangers,
I got no one to trust
Following footprints
but they turn into dust
Try to move on
but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you
Now I'm feeling lonely
in the city of love
Thought it'd be different

Remind me how
it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin'
I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Oh just sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Remember me now
time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become
what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep

Fingertips,"1,755",Kisma,"I wonder what went wrong, today
Why do I feel like I linger
Linger between the words, to say
To say the words to remember

Chorus: Kisma
Now we're here, to take control
Over your body, and over your soul
We gonna take back everything and lose it all
Lose it all, lose it all
Feeling it in your arms
Feeling it in your legs
Feeling it on your Fingertips
And feel it in your head
Just let your body go
Just let your body go
Just let your body go
And move to the rhythm

Verse: Kisma
Now we won't go back home, today
Until the very last hour
We still got few more days, to slay
It's gonna get so much louder

Chorus 2: Kimsa
Now we're here, to take control
Over your body, and over your soul
We gonna take back everything and lose it all

Stuck (Feat. Tove Styrke),"1,639",Lost Kings,"Just because I can't put
my finger on the problem
Doesn't mean there ain't a problem
We're so quick to think history
could just solve 'em
Don't you think we would've
solved them by now
I gave you what you wanted
Moved East right after college
But nothing filled the space
I called you wherever you hearted
Moved West the end of August
So I could find a place
But maybe I need ya
'Cause it's harder than I thought
Baby I need ya
But you always want too much
Oh fuck it I need ya
And I'm really trying tonight
But I miss it when it's dark aah
Aah somewhere between love
Aah got feelings I don't trust
Aah right in between love
Aah stuck
I get so possessed of
when I see you happy
But I want you to be happy
I get so conflicted
when I see you without me
Are you better off without me
Don't you know you gave me
what I wanted
So quiet in the morning
Just you and I could
fill the space
Lately I've start to notice
Have been missing
all the little moments
By now I thought I'd be okay
But maybe I need ya
'Cause it's harder than I thought
Baby I need ya
But you always want too much
Oh fuck it I need ya
And I'm really trying tonight
But I miss it when it's dark aah
Aah somewhere between love
Aah got feelings I don't trust
Aah right in between love
Aah stuck
Stuck inside this feeling baby
Stuck inside this love
Stuck inside a moment baby
Can we give it up
Stuck inside this feeling baby
Stuck inside this love
Stuck inside a moment baby
Can we give it up
Aah somewhere between love
Aah got feelings I don't trust
Aah right in between love

Heading Home,479,Alan Walker,"[Verse 1]
I was so insatiable
'Til the lights came on
And the stories got old
Now there's no one here I know
And the city outside's
Not the same anymore

{Pre Chorus]
And I
I remember when we were young
We'd write our names in the sand, so carelessly
Then the rain came and yours was gone
And now mine, it stands alone

[Chorus]
Nobody sees me
Now I'm a one man show
I'll do this on my own
We knew it all then
Now this is all I know
Guess I'm heading home now
Ooh-ooh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now
And the music always played

[Verse 2]
With the sound of our lives
And the sweetest escape
And the neighbours would complain
We would turn it up louder
Who cares anyway?

[Pre Chorus 2]
Cause we-
We remember that we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
Had we made our castles and kingdoms up?
Now the waves have torn them down
Nobody sees me
Now I'm a one man show
Ooh-ooh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now

[Verse 3]
You'll find me
I'll be here, oh
I can't see
I can't breathe anymore
But how could we have stayed?
You were high on love
I was drunk
Drunk on the pain

I'm heading home

And he makes
you feel like you should
And all your friends say

His love for you is true
But does he know you call me
when he sleeps
But does he know the pictures
that you keep
But does he know the reasons
that you cry
Or tell me does he know
where your heart lies
Where it truly lies
Yeah
You should be with him
I let you go from time
You should stay with him
'Cause he seems
like he's good for you
And he makes you feel

Shooting Stars,"1,659",Bag Raiders,"It's late and I'm awake, staring at the wall
Open up my window, head floats out the door
No one else around, the shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head, blinded by the sky
Feel my weight in front, following the sound
Moves away so fast, fall down to the ground
I know there's more to come, jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me, chasing down the street

Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasing
I'm in love with a shooting star
But she moves so fast, when she falls then I'll be waiting
Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasing
I'm in love with a shooting star
But she moves so fast, when she falls then I'll be waiting
Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasing
I'm in love with a shooting star

Back When This Started (Feat. Sam Vesso),58,ZEVY,"Back When This Started

We were younger back when this started
children at heart and we did it all for the hell of it just because
i remember wishing we'd make it, hoping and praying but take a step back in the gap what its become
we put our blood sweat and tears, into all of this which came from nothing don't let me down we've come way too far now
to run and let fear into all of this which came from nothing got here on our own
either we can go hard or we can go home
either we can go hard or we can go home
We were older when we decided if we put our time in and didn't get distracted maybe this could really happen
let's show them what we're made of show em' what we're made of
what's there to be scared of

We put our blood sweat and tears into all of this which came from nothing don't let me down we've come way too far now
to run and let fear into all of this which came from nothing got here on our own either
we can go hard or we can go home
we can go hard or we can go home
we can go hard or we can go home
we can go hard or we can go home
we can go hard or we can go home
oh woah oh woah
oh woah oh woah
Can you feel it rising slowly taking hold
now I'm realising we can go hard or we can go home
look at the horizon
see whats just below
now I'm realising
we can go hard or we can go home
we can go hard or we can go home
we can go hard or we can go home
we can go hard or we can go home
oh woah oh woah
oh woah oh woah
oh woah oh woah
We put our blood sweat and tears blood sweat and tears
into all of this which came from nothing don't let me down don't let me down
we've come way too far now come way too far now

Shadow Of The Sun,995,Max Elto,"They say that life is
always easier
after you let yourself
come undone
They say they'll give you
all that you want

in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time no one
has been before
close the curtains
what are you waiting for
And I'll be keeping secrets
till I'm in the ground
Changing colors makes
you waste away
just paint your eyes
with a vivid mind
Now you see
what's behind the lights
And I'll be waiting
in the shadow of the sun
Finding treasures that
has been on demise
building mountains
in disguise
and I'll be keeping secrets
till I'm in the ground
I'm in the shadow
of the shadow of the sun
where I belong there's
something coming on
I'm in the shadow
of the shadow of the sun

I count the seconds

Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this
I won't be the one
No I won't be the one
I know it's pathetic
Fuck it yeah I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance
that I'll regret it so

I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached
the end yet

I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been

All it takes is that one look you do and I run right back to you
You cross the line and it's time to say ""F"" you

What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck, with you, and that's that

Leaving you alone is the hardest
Even when you're out of focus
I will be the light in your life
You'll see clear

I'll be your inspiration
Cause I know that you'll do just what you're told
I'll be your hard earned temptation
Cause I know that you'll make it on your own

Are You Lonely (feat. ISÁK),"2,175",Steve Aoki,"I know that you're calling me
To light up and let the shadow
That follows you underneath
I know that you’re calling me
I don't want to play it safe
'Cause I don’t contend like that
Just keep falling into me
I know I got your back
Are you lonely Are you lonely
Are you lonely
I'll stand by you I'll stand by you
Are you lonely Are you lonely
Are you lonely
I'll stand by you I'll stand by you
Whoever said it was easy
They never know what we'd do
Oh when these walls fall down
I'll stand by you
What you believe in
I'll give it to you
’Cause when these walls fall down
I’ll stand by you
Are you lonely Are you lonely
Are you lonely
I'll stand by you I’ll stand by you
Are you lonely Are you lonely

I'll stand by you I'll stand by you"
Ain’t Gonna Happen,580,Glaceo,"When I first met you
I thought I was crazy
An apple don't fall from the tree
Dad said he felt the same
way I feel lately
The way I get when you at look at me
And I'm not trying
to make this harder
But falling in love
ain't in the cards though
If you say I'm playing
with your heart
Just stop me stop me
We can go on like this
Holding out for that kiss
The one that doesn't exist
It ain't gonna happen
I'm seeing it on your lips
I wish I could grant that wish
But darling it ain't like this
It ain't gonna happen
Right now we're both hiding
inside of our rooms
Not talking holding out for a truce
I'm guessing you're waiting
to see my next move
Well guess what
I don't know what to do
And I'm not trying
to make this harder
You and I are just sons
and daughters
If I'm about to walk on water
Stop me stop me
We can go on like this
Holding out for that kiss
The one that doesn't exist
It ain't gonna happen
I'm seeing it on your lips
I wish I could grant that wish
But darling it ain't like this
It ain't gonna happen
Cause we could be best friends
Here is the lesson
If those feelings rest in peace
As soon as you do
Somebody brand new
can give you what you need
We can go on like this
Holding out for that kiss
The one that doesn't exist
But it ain't gonna happen
I'm seeing it on your lips
I wish I could grant that wish
But darling it ain't like this
It ain't gonna happen
We can go on like this
Holding out for that kiss
The one that doesn't exist
But it ain't gonna happen
I'm seeing it on your lips

Birthday,"3,176",Disclosure,"Oh babe oh babe
You've been on my mind
Just an old flame old flame
I left you behind
But oh if it were any other day
Maybe you'd want me to stay away
I'm just wonderin'
what you would say
Or would it be a big mistake
Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working
Yeah
I ain't even callin'
for no reconciliation
I just want to tap
in and see how you been
I've waited for
an adequate amount of time
To give us both some space
I think it's been good
for us to stay up out of the way
But it can't hurt to check up
on an ex not to flex
But to put the hurt to rest
put maturity to the test
So I'm callin' to say Are you okay
on your special day
Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working
If I called you on your birthday
Would it be worth it
Should I call you on your birthday
Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working

I'm gonna hurt someone

With my feelings
And leave it all
blame it all Inexperienced
Since you rubbed your back
with my heart
Why did I give it again
It's time you broke
it’s my direction
It takes a soul stick to me
And you still I still can't
find my feelings
So I turn to you
look the other way
So I won't see you kill this face
Couldn't help falling in again
I couldn't help it
Tried to pick my words away
And this time
only healed this game
Time only heals this game
You just play on
But you just play
With my feelings
Blame it all
You still blame it all

Got real clothes and fake friends
We're real close on weekends
We keep up the pretense
We smash up the whole street
Then pay off the police
Just tryna be low-key
I'm drippin' Gucci, runnin' empty all night
Red wine, no pride, I'm here for the good time
I'm only sober
When I'm hungover
But it's cool
'Cause all my friends are rich
All my friends are rich
And I love it
Air in my wallet

All This Time,802,Deorro,"All this time
Still a part of me
Standing on your street
At your door
Knocking to the beat
Of a melody
Take me back
Take me back to summers
when the nights were long
Pick it up
Pick it up
the pieces where we left off
Still hear it just like a record
Playing on after all this time
Still feel it with me forever
Backseat with your hands in mine
Backseat with your hands in mine
Backseat with your hands in mine
I don't mind
If you’re haunting me
In my memory
Let's rewind
'Cause I can’t believe
Feels like centuries
Take me back
Take me back to summers
when the nights were long
Pick it up
Pick it up
the pieces where we left off
Still hear it just like a record
Playing on after all this time
Still feel it with me forever
Backseat with your hands in mine
Backseat with your hands in mine
Still hear it just like a record
Playing on after all this time
Still feel it with me forever
Backseat with your hands in mine
See you and I go falling
Right back to when we met
And I hear it just like a record
Playing on after all this time

Save Me,603,Steve Aoki,"One night in the city
One night tryna find myself
My mind's so busy
Spent the night with someone else
Got high 'cause I'm feeling low
Holding tight never letting go
But one night in the city
One night can change it all
'Round and 'round in circles
till I met you at the stoplight
I can still remember touching you
and what it felt like
'Round and 'round in circles
till you saved me for the first time
For the last time
That's when you saved me
From myself
Saved me
Yeah you saved me
From myself
Saved me
I was lost without you
until I found you
You're bringing me back around
Save me from myself
That's when you
That's when you saved me from myself
Saved me
Yeah you saved me
From myself
Saved me
That's when you
That's when you
That night in the city
Ten steps behind myself
My mind wasn't pretty
Until you took me somewhere else
Got high 'cause I'm feeling low
No I'll never let you go 'cause
One night in the city
One night you changed it all
'Round and 'round in circles
till I met you at the stoplight
I can still remember touching you

Symphony,57,Coffeeshop,"I've been hearing symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singing on my own
Now I can't find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio

Will you hold me tight and not let go
Symphony

Will you hold me tight and not let go

Every day you're here, I'm healing
And I was runnin' out of luck
I never thought I'd find this feeling
'Cause I've been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
And now your song is on repeat

Trying Not To Cry,337,Kina,"Can you hear all of my open wounds
I'm whispering as loud
as the flowers bloom
I've been somewhere in the sky
don't worry
I'll be right on time if I can help it
I'm so sorry
I've been trying not to cry
in the grocery store
Little bully inside
pinning me to the floor
It must be easier than it seems
But I can't get these thorns
out of my teeth
It's killing me but I want more
Cover my ears
I think I'm shutting down
going standby
Sleep mode offline
Feel nothing
It's quiet as hell in my room
I've been fighting
for my sanctuary
How do I stay alive
if I don't wanna be
I've been trying not to cry
in the grocery store
Littlе bully inside
pinning me to the floor
It must bе easier than it seems
But I can't get these thorns
out of my teeth
It's killing me but I want more"
OK,903,Alan Walker,"It's so uncomfortable at times
Finding it so hard to say
I'm broken again
The things we never talk about
I'm a bit afraid to let you know it
When I told you it was fine
It was just another lie
Just like boys don't cry
Lost in the threads
of the little spider webs
Got me hiding in a corner
Trying not to call her
This is all a heartbreak
Just like you said
A fairy tale from hell
Thanks to everything you told me
Even though I'm only
Imma be OK
When I told you it was fine
It was just another lie
Saying boys don't cry
Lost in the threads
of the little spider webs
Got me hiding in a corner
Trying not to call her
This is all a heartbreak
Just like you said
A fairy tale from hell
Thanks to everything you told me
Even though I'm only
Imma be OK
Imma be OK"

Look at me now

I gotta go
Put on a show like i’m a rockstar baby

About to blow cuz I’m a rockstar baby

I can do this everyday
Up in the air like a plane
And I feel it in my bones

you can't even have a good time

And it wasn't low blows

Am I the only the one getting tired
Why is everybody so obsessed
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down
and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

Morse Code (Feat. Odile & Geoffroy),"1,806",Men I Trust,"Night loots us of our time
Hints of defeat through me
Yielding to one final pun,
And shared flashing glaze
But our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Our hearts talking low
A fading Morse code
But our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Our hearts talking low
A fading Morse code
Quick! Says a darting bird
Fierce is nature's way
Trophies bared up high
Strong men do have firm grips
And though I seize
the high-prized advise
Distracted by labor and wraiths
Can't set my mind with it
Keeping me away from heap
And our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Hearts talking low
A fading Morse code
And our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Our hearts talking low

The girls all now do the Suzie-Q,
Clap their hands in the center of the floor,
Saying, ""Ching, ching, chop-suey, swing some more!""

Now, geisha girls in old Japan,
Wink behind their peacock fans,
Since they learned to say, ""Yeah!
Let's swing it like Amelican's swing swing dance!""

Now, Gypsy caravans have changed their mode,
They truck down the Romany road,
With their hi-de-hos, and their hey-hey-diddle,
Doin' the swing on the Gypsy fiddle.

Them eastern wisemen know the story,
Of the swing with Oriental glory,
They stroke their beards and grin,

From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side

What stands behind the North
But I got a feeling
It's a feeling that's we're dying for
Just close your eyes
and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving
till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

Just tell me that you are the only one
And take me back
where we belong
I need you by my side
you make me come alive
Don't give up I'm holding on
Don't leave me here this way
I just need you to stay
So take me back where we belong
I'm dreaming of the days
when we were young
We could've had it all
so what went wrong
I'm dreaming of the time
that feels long gone
Just take me back
where we belong
I'm longing for your touch
that felt so right
I know that we can go
for real this time
Just tell me that you are the only one
So take me back
where we belong
I need you by my side
you make me come alive
Don't give up I'm holding on
Don't make me hate this way
I just need you to stay
So take me back where we belong"

Wonderland,"4,530",Caravan Palace,"Just imagine a trip to a wonderful land
Of candy, and jam, and ice cream

I gotta hit that street you better watch it
With a gat that I cock with a full clip
I got the whip, got the clip, I keep it undercover
all up in the club just to live it up
See the stone cold face, try to knock it
I can't stop, I'm a rocket
I gotta be in it, I gotta be in it
I gotta be ba da be ba da be da be it

See the big gold chain that I'm rockin'
I got the ring for the bling, not a problem
I got a stash full of cash that I owe to my brother
All up in the club, just to live it up
Watch the street turn cold when I walk it
It's my rules no man can stop it
I throw a kick so quick that'll leave you in the gutter
Leave you in the gutter, gutter, gutter

All up in the club, all up in the gutter
Just imagine, wonderful land
Why do all these things never happen
I'm just a random girl with gentle manners
If my dreams aren't rocked and I rule the wonderland
All up in the club, all up in the gutter"

Cause tonight girl you're all mine
There's no point in trying to hide it
I will come and find it
I know it's in there somewhere
Your love for me is out there
I can hear it calling
Where's your sense of belonging
We could be getting frisky girl
Till three o'clock in the morning
Something caught my attention
Yeah it's you I'm talking 'bout
Cause your eyes are like an ocean
I can dive straight into that
And I feel like a wave passed
When I'm 'round you
Nothing can bring me down
You make me candles
Nothing I would think
can stop us now
There's no point in trying to hide it
I will come and find it
I know it's in there somewhere

you keep on fighting me
You won't know
what you got until it's gone
So smooth your hair back on
Know that you're my girl
You are my number my number one
My number one
Girl you're my number one
There's no point in trying to hide it

The Shine (Feat. Chelsea Cutler),"1,186",ayokay,"I tripped and fell into
A rythm with you
I jumped off the deep end
But still played it cool
Tried to pretend we're not different
And I hate that I have to admit it
But I'm done with wishing

I know it's only a matter of time till the shine wears off
Cause I'm all out of words, feel alone every time we touch
The more that I hold you, the more I don't know your touch
I know it's only a matter of time till the shine wears off

I know that we're living inside of a dream
Cause we're trying too hard to make this a thing
Why does it feel like we're working
You act like a whole different person
I'm tired of searching

I know it's only a matter of time till the shine wears off
Cause I'm all out of words, feel alone every time we touch
The more that I hold you, the more I don't know your touch
I know it's only a matter of time till the shine wears off

I'll be fine knowing it's over
Clearer eyes come with getting older
We fantasize but we had our day
Now your diguise is fading
Your disguise is fading away

I know it's only a matter of time till the shine wears off
Cause I'm all out of words, feel alone every time we touch
The more that I hold you, the more I don't know your touch
I know it's only a matter of time till the shine wears off

Feel alone every time we touch
The more that I hold you, the more I don't know your touch
I know it's only a matter of time till the shine wears off"

Born To Run (feat. Dalton Diehl),44,Madism,"How did we get here
Damn it was a struggle every night
Prayers through the bad years
Always had that something in your eyes
I’d do it
Over and over again
Leaving behind innocence
Like we’re supposed to do
We were born to run
And Theres a million miles
A million miles
To roam
With the rising sun
Oh there's a million ways
A million ways home
That lead home back
where the heart is
Where the love for it all started
Where the highs got us
through the lows
We were born to run
And there’s a million miles
A million miles to roam
We were born to run
I can feel it coming
Follow you like rivers where you lead
Everything or nothing
We put it back together, every piece
I’d do it
Over and over again
Leaving behind innocence
Like we’re supposed to do
We were born to run
And Theres a million miles
A million miles
To roam
With the rising sun
Oh there's a million ways
A million ways home
That lead home back
where the heart is
Where the love for it all started
Where the highs got us
through the lows
We were born to run
And there’s a million miles
A million miles to roam
We were born to run
That lead home back

Where the love for it all started
Where the highs got us

We were born to run
And there’s a million miles
A million miles to roam"
Kids,137,Patrick Lite,"hold me
on the troublesome days
when I feel lonely
I hear my brothers calling from the ocean
live for the weekend we’re living bitter sweet

cause late nights, the partying
the bills we pay in the morning
I hate the high and lows we call a week
I wish we stripped it all apart
found a way to find our
adolescence for our inner peace

tell me
pretty white lies to keep me from running
into the tide when my head starts rushing
tell me the good, outweighs bad in the end

cause late nights, the partying
the bills we pay in the morning
I hate the high and lows we call a week
I wish we stripped it all apart
and found a way to find our
adolescence for our inner peace

when we were kids"

But I heard from a friend of a friend
Life is movin' on without me
Even callin' other lovers your baby
I knew that you would eventually
But it still feels strange
As I drift away
And you touch her hips like that
Am I on your brain?
It's always a part of me, part of you now, baby
I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?

I know everything that we wanted,
we'd outgrown
But still I don't, don't like knowin' that
you're not on your own
Can someone tell my ego
'cause she won't let me let it go?
She's obsessin' and guessin' answers
to things she'll never know
Oh, yeah
As I drift away
And you touch her lips like that, yeah

Fragments of Time (feat. Todd Edwards),"5,017",Daft Punk,"Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sun light into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it’s crystal clear
That I don’t ever want it to end
If I had my way
I would never leave
Keep building
these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can’t stay
I’ll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I’ll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Familiar faces I’ve never seen
Living the gold
and the silver dream
Making me feel like
I’m seventeen
And it’s crystal clear
That I don’t ever want it to end
If I had my way
I would never leave
Keep building
these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can’t stay
I’ll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I’ll just keep playing back
These fragments of time

you surrender to the night

When both of us were intertwined
Who knew something

Was an illusion in my mind

Still do you feel feel
Feel good Real bad"
Lost Without You (with Dean Lewis),727,Kygo,"(I'm- I'm a little lost with-
I'm- I'm a little lost without you
I'm a little lost without you)
I was falling apart
So caught in the dark
Now that you're gone I see it
You were lighting my way
But so much has changed
So where did you go
Tell me you love me
Or tell me you're leaving
Don't keep me waiting here
all night
'Cause you were not ready
Ready for someone
Someone to stay right by your side
Oh I don't want to let you go
I'm a little lost without you
a little lost without you
My darling you are all I know
I'm a little lost without you
a little lost without you
Without you by my side

Tell me you love me
(I'm- I'm a little lost with-
I'm- I'm a little lost
without you)
A little lost without you
I lost count of the days
So lost in a haze
Wherever I go I feel you
You say you needed some time to
Go back and find you
How could I know
Oh tell me you love me
Or tell me you're leaving
Don't keep me waiting here
all night
'Cause you are not ready
Ready for someone
Someone to stay right by your side
Oh I don't want to let you go
I'm a little lost without you

Prettiest To Me,325,HYBS,"If our love was
Like a song
That we wrote
and sang together

It would be the sweetest
Of memories and melodies
Oh I could never

Forget how it feels
To have fallen for you
You will always be
Special to me

So won’t you sing along
To our brand new song
It might not last forever
But ain’t it pretty
I’ll write the melody
You write the words for me
It might not be the prettiest
But it’s the prettiest
To me

You are on my mind all the time
Oh it’s too good to be true
I’m madly in love with you


Forget how it feels
To have fallen for you
You will always be
Special to me

So won’t you sing along
To our brand new song
It might not last forever
But ain’t it pretty
I’ll write the melody
You write the words for me
It might not be the prettiest
But it’s the prettiest
To me

You are
You are
The prettiest to me"

my dough so I could buy C 3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke
in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid
I ate Spaghetti Os
played laser tag and GI Joe's

I spent my Saturdays
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was Lion King

I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie my friends and I
were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing
trees and Dr Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of Jurassic Park
was how real the Raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS
watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff

When did you become so cruel

I will never let you go
Never let you go
I'll never let you go
If we fall off of our life
I will always keep a hold
Never let you go
never let you go
Through the longest of time
I will never let you go
Never let you go

If we fall off of our life
I will always keep a hold
oh-no
I will never let you go

Pay No Mind (Feat. Passion Pit),"3,188",Madeon,"She was dancing she was smiling
This was blooming in your cheeks
Inner quiet kind of litany
She accepted from the feet
And then she turned into my arms
Of disgrace and then repelled
Now she's fallen to her knees
But you couldn't ever tell
And then
she asked me how we got here
I told her I don't know
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying
So this isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and
Pay don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
Let it burn as if we'd bothered
We'll make sound based off their eyes
As she closes just to open
It's some sirens rolling by
And as she's off to tell her secret
To her friends somewhere in town
And her friend just takes a moment
And that's why I'm not around
Darling this is something
I should have told you long ago
I just want you to feel safe
I just want to make you glow
But how you glowed
when we were young
And with nothing on our minds
When you jump for your love
Baby you're nothing long of time
And then
she asked me how we got here
I told her I don't know
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying
So this isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and
Pay don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
Why did we have to
go further every time
Some days you hear it
don't listen I'll carry you
Some days you don't
to the universe we'll never go
Sometimes you feel it
it's not worth it help me
Sometimes you won't
Just calm yourself and
Pay don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind"
Until You Were Gone (Feat. Emily Warren),"3,586",The Chainsmokers,"Thought that I'd be better off
if I were on my own
I tried to put my finger on
the moment we were wronged
But the taste turned bitter
so I pulled the trigger
Not so easy to move on
I guess I should have known
Ice cold I freeze up
when I see you
left you just to find out
that I need you
So far
I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start
the whole thing over
Ever since I left you
I'm tryina get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I'm burning on the inside
and the truth is that I didn't know
how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone
I was always told that only time
would heal the pain
Yet even though it's been so long
it still hurts just the same
Now I'm finding that
the break was binding
Let's take back everything I said
Oh won't you just come home
Ice cold I freeze up
when I see you
left you just to find out
that I need you
So far I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start
the whole thing over
Ever since I left you
I'm tryina get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I'm burning on the inside
and the truth is that I didn't know
how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone
Until you were gone

I guess the signs were wrong
'Cause at the end of the day
I came from love
When I see what they've got
I realize I shouldn't settle
Nothing less, nothing less
I could confess what I mean

I gave you my all and that's the truth
I never gave up on me and you
I need you to give me your best

And I need to know if I'm enough
I've put in the work, now it's your turn

So don't you leave
The lonely nights are terrifying
Only if you're

These emotions
The river never runs dry

I know you can do better
So I'ma save you the best of me
I know you can do better
So I'ma give you the rest of me


I gave you my all
I never gave up on you
I need you to give me your best

Standing Still (feat. Victoria Voss),"1,013",Joakim Molitor,"Left your flowers by the bed
Pile of books I never read
Gotta give you space
To get over your feelings
I know what you think
Baby we've gone out of sync
Wanna feel the same again
Though you're good at concealing
That that
that you wanna keep me close
But what
what if we had an overdose
Why why has it gone
all chemical babe ohh
High high high
until we hit the lows
Up and down
that's how the story goes
Ride ride riding
on a rollercoaster
At first we hit the sky
But then we tumble down
We're waiting to take off though
we'd be happier without
From poison to a pill
Love potion to the kill
We're waiting for these thrills
Though we both know
we're standing still
We're standing still
We're standing still
We're standing still
We're standing still
So let me cut the chase
Said I'm happy but I ain't
Gotta give me space
Gotta give me space
To wrestle with my demons
Loved you God forbid
I was hoping that you did
Wanna feel the same again
Or maybe I'm just dreaming
That that
that you wanna keep me close
But what
what if we had an overdose
Why why has it gone

Ironic,613,Remzee,"An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery
and died the next day
It’s a black fly
in your Chardonnay
It’s a death row pardon
two minutes too late
Isn’t it ironic don’t you think
Mr Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase
and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life
to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down
he thought
Well isn’t this nice
And isn’t it ironic
l don’t you think
It’s like rain
on your wedding day
It’s a free ride
when you’ve already paid
It’s the good advice
that you just didn’t take
Who would’ve thought it figures
A traffic jam
when you’re already late
A no-smoking sign
on your cigarette break
It’s like ten thousand spoons
when all you need is a knife
It’s meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting
his beautiful wife
And isn’t it ironic
don’t you think
A little too ironic
and yeah I really do think
It’s like rain
on your wedding day
It’s a free ride
when you’ve already paid
It’s the good advice
that you just didn’t take
Who would’ve thought
it figures
It’s like rain
It’s like rain
on your wedding day
It’s a free ride
when you’ve already paid
It’s the good advice
that you just didn’t take
Who would’ve thought
it figures
Well life has a funny way
of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny way
of helping you out

Killer,253,HYBS,"Your heart is cold

That I better stay away from you

Look so innocent

That you would be the death of me

Who would believe
You’d be the one who kills me

Baby you were born as a killer
Born as a killer
When you called me babe you’re never alone
Cuz you were born as a killer
Nothing but a sinner
Oh i better be on my own

You gotta real mean streak baby
Ain’t nothing but a crime scene lately
ripped out my heart in cold blood lady
Oh think i better stay away from you

Told myself you'd be gone

I just heard you found the one
you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known
that wasn't me
Cause even after all this time
I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress
you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love
was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame
we don't talk any more
we don't talk any more
I just hope you're lying
next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason
that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up
at your door
But I'm just too afraid
that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you
so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love
was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

That we don't talk anymore

Now I painted over old mistakes
Just tryin' to find
my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
To know I couldn't live without it
I see your face in the moments
I feel lost
'Cause I lost my way
and I feel the fault
All I wanna say is
I'm sorry (Woah)
I just needed space,
my heart to break
'Cause givin' you up
was my greatest mistake
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
I hate I couldn't hold you up
When we were
in the waters drownin'
Now I painted over old mistakes
Just tryin' to find
my way back to you
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
To know I couldn't live without it
(Woah)
It's like the world stands still
Without your love (Woah)
Nothing's real
I hate I had to lose your love
To know I couldn't live without it
Hate I couldn't hold you up

Get a little bit drunk
Get little messed up
Get a little bit oh my my

Have little bit too much fun-un-un
Sometimes
Give a little less fucks
In the back of the club

It's alright
I can do what I want sometimes
Been lost in my emotions
Been looking for a sweet escape
I'll show you where l'm going
I'll take you to a, a better place
Leave your worries with me
I'll be your remedy
Your hand pressed onto my cheeks

Play our songs on repeat
Lost in the melody
Come fade into it with me (Ah, ah, ah)

Or what would have you
Love to see your waterfalls,
we can come to that too
(Ooh, do a light year on the dash)
You can see her in the pass'
Other than your ass,
it's the freedom that we grab
So put it all on my tab, on my tongue
(Doin' what I want) Let me see you go up
Show me how you get down
Love it when you go left to right (Right)
Girl, you know what I want
We ain't gotta take long
I'm just tryna figure out your vibe (Vibe)
You know you're good wherever I'm at
Smokin' like the science lab
Morning after nightcap (Ooh)
Girl, you know I'm like that
Changin' with the climate
If it feels natural, I never fight that
Leave your worries with me
I'll be your remedy

Did I learn about trust in the ring with suffering

next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason
that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up
at your door
But I'm just too afraid
that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you

To choose ride or die
I would risk it all
I'm not afraid
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy

Would you do the same
Tell me
Are you with me ride or die
Are you ready to survive with me
'Cause I wanna face
this crazy life with you
Fuck and fight with you
On and on until we're insane
So now I believe
we're just meant for each other
The way that you touch me
I've never known better
I'm so sick of guessing
so take me or let go
Just choose yes or no
Baby by now you should understand
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Please be careful
my heart's in your hands
Tell me
Are you with me ride or die
Are you ready to survive with me

Fireflies,"1,205",Owl City,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I
Would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as
it seems
Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightening bugs
As they tried to teach me
how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is
just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as
it seems
When I fall asleep
Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I trie of counting sheep
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as
they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
Cause I saved a few
And I keep them in a jar
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything
is never as it seems
When I fall asleep
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd
Rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as
it seems
I'd like to make myself believe

bursting at the seams"

All of the problems that came into light
Say that we're good but we know that we're lying
Can't find a reason to try 'cause

Everything about you I thought I loved
Was all just in my head, yeah I was making shit up
The heaven that I felt wasn't what it was

That I imagined more than there really was
And I told everyone
That in the end I wanted it to be us but

Can’t find my way without you God knows what I’ll do

I thought of you I can't deny
But the minute that I realized
That you were means to an end
And I wasn't gonna pretend
Then you ran and reappeared
You're no longer just a souvenir
Taking all the words I wanna hear
Your hands wandering in the cab
And now you can't take it back
'Cause we got too much history
And all you wanna do is fuck with me
But we got too much history
Too wake up in my bed
With you lying next to me
With you lying next to me oh oh
With you lying next to me me
'Cause we got too much history
With you lying next to me
With you lying next to me oh oh
With you lying next to me me
'Cause we got too much history
Your every wish is my command
With the Gin and tonic in your hand
Only words that me
and you can understand
But then when nobody knows
We're already in the cab home
'Cause we got too much history
And all you wanna do is fuck with me
But we got too much history
Too wake up in my bed

Something About You (Chill Mix),311,Elderbrook,"I miss the touch of morning time
Making silhouettes of us
Way back when we had our paradise
Been staying out all through the night
Smoking, drinking, getting high
I was wrong and I apologised
Where did you go?
What can I do?
I'm workin' on my problems
But I need you here to solve them
Where did you go?
What should I say?
I hope that I can make a change 'cause
There's somethin' 'bout you
Keepin' me sober
I was drownin' in the moment
But now I'm holdin' onto you
There's somethin' 'bout you
Keepin' me sober
I was drownin' in the moment
But now I'm holdin' onto you
There's somethin' 'bout you
That keeps pickin' me up when I'm low
There's somethin' 'bout you
That keeps pickin' me up when I'm low
I miss the company we had
Back when I was still on track
Now I'm makin' my own paradise
But now the drink is tasting strange
And the high isn't the same
Well I'm still wrong and I apologise
Where did you go?
What can I do?
I'm workin' on my problems
But I need you here to solve them
Where did you go?
What should I say?
I hope that I can make a change 'cause
There's somethin' 'bout you
Keepin' me sober
I was drownin' in the moment
But now I'm holdin' onto you
There's somethin' 'bout you
Keepin' me sober

Eighteen,"1,249",Tep No,"I was only eighteen chasing dreams

starts to fall
I won't be around

When I was only eighteen
only eighteen
I had a picture
A great disaster in my mind
And the world would look at me
And love me through all disguise
But now that I'm older
I think of what I lost chasing time
I found disorder
come with pain in this life this life

"All Falls Down (Feat. Noah Cyrus, Digital Farm Animals) (Mio Remix)","7,851",Alan Walker,"What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do and I run right back to you
You cross the line and it's time to say ""F"" you

What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck, with you, and that's that

[Chrous]
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine

[Verse 2]
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go

[Chorus]
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine

[Outro]
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (fine, fine, fine, fine)
I'll be fine

You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad

I'll be fine"
Feel Again (Feat. Harley Bird),"1,639",Culture Code,"I recall the past again, tonight
It's in the front of my mind
As we fall apart
You began to cry
The tears are making you blind
The future's far away, but I will stay
I will stay
Just take a leap of faith
We'll find a way, for you and me
Can't look back, can't run
From what I feel inside
There's no more time to hide

Chorus: Harley Bird
Because I..
I Feel Again
I, I Feel Again, oh now
I, I Feel Again
We're bringing this back to life
I Feel Again, I Feel it Again, oh now x2
I Feel it Again

We're bringing this back to life

Verse: Harley Bird
Help me find the right words to say
To get us back on our way
Can we try to fight against the grain, I've thrown out what we made
The future's far away, but I will stay
I will stay

Chorus: Harley Bird
Because I..
I Feel Again
I, I Feel Again, oh now
I, I Feel Again
We're bringing this back to life
We're picking up where we left
Off and on again
We never quite could forget
Cause what we got is so intense
I Feel Again, I Feel it Again, oh now x2

I Feel it Again
I Feel Again
We're bringing this back to life"

no spare room
Now the places I walk
I never filled up by the mess you
bring with you
Say my name say my name

You can play all your games
But I'm calling your bluff
Already getting on so long

Shit you left in my house
Hanging around like
I'm done with the favors
And you kept texting me back
Blah-blah-blah
but I said no more talking
'Cause you know you fucked up
And that's some tough luck
Now I'm off to a party

Have read between the lines
Left the engine runnin'
I guess this is goodbye

We've been here about a thousand times
Should've never let you back inside
Inside my mind


I should've known better than to let you break my heart
I should've known better, I believed you from the start
I should've known better and now we wasted all this time
I should've known better, so I'm taking back my life


Should've known better than that

Since I've got my senses

You call me every night
You're looking through our photos, but I deleted mine


And you're never gonna change my mind

Just set them up to knock them down,

'Cause I just set them up,

How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,

Out of control,

I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow,

Push it baby, push it baby,

Out of control,

This is the same old dance that you already know,

Push it baby, push it baby,

Alone (Feat. Lauren Evans),"4,005",Armin Van Buuren,"Everyone is
walking on the edge of life
Like a ghost of
a shadow barely alive
Even times in a rush
but it’s going nowhere
Everyone’s connected
but no one is connecting
The human element
has long been missing
Tell me have you seen
it have you seen it
Oh we’re alone
‘Cause I need
something to believe it
Tell me are we alone
Where is the love
where is the feeling
Is anybody out there
Is anyone listening
Is anyone loved
in this whole world
Oh we’re alone Alone
Loved in this whole world Alone
Where is the feeling
Everybody needs
to know somebody who cares
Just a friendly face
you can trust to be there
Are you afraid to be known
And not be a stranger
Cause everyone’s connected
but no one is connecting
The human element
has long been missing
Tell me have you seen
it have you seen it
Oh we’re alone
Cause I need something to

Tell me are we alone
Where is the love

Of places in London you wanted to go
Those tourist shops around camden town
take a late night ride on the underground
See the gardens and drink warm beer
I know you would die… if you knew I was here
I feel so helpless and I feel so far away
If you knew where I was I wonder what you’d say
I feel guilty and I don’t know how to tell you
I saw London without you
Everything here makes me miss you
I can picture us
Still in love
Holding hands on a rooftop bus
I haven’t posted any pictures
Cause there’s a part of me
That still believes
Ill bring you back to these

See the gardens and drink warm beer

Was just pretending

And have some drinks with me
Meet me where my heart

Meet me where my heart has been
Where my story once began
From grey into the blue
From darkness to the light

I'm sorry but I need ya, need ya
Sorry but I need ya
I'm sorry but I'm freaked out, freaked out
Sorry but I need ya

I'm sorry but I need ya, need ya
Sorry but I need ya
I'm sorry but I'm freaked out, freaked out
Sorry but I need ya

I'm not sure why I'm calling
All I hear's myself talking
But I think I've been falling
Ever since you laid your eyes on me
I try too hard, yeah, I know it
I move too fast and I
Maybe this time I owe it
To myself to keep it in for once

I'm sorry but I need ya, need ya
Sorry but I need ya
I'm sorry but I'm freaked out, freaked out
Sorry but I need ya
I'm sorry but I need ya, need ya
Sorry but I need ya
I'm sorry but I'm freaked out, freaked out
Sorry but I need ya

We could go high

Therapy,115,Duke Dumont,"The cut was so deep

He got me on my knees
down and praying
Hoping that you'll take
me to a place

with you
Need your love to look my way
Our love
Our love baby
Our love
Our love I love you baby
All I wanna do is get
on with the start
'Cause it won't stop
ticking away my life
You and me we got a little time
To take what we can
and leave the rest behind
I'm ready for something deeper
Come on let's give it a name

Start Over,62,Jako Diaz,"I'd rather lie by the shore
let my thoughts float away
When my perception is clear
and nothing holds me back
And I can feel like a current
that's pulling me closer
to something new
While I am drifting
I'm drifting away
from the past I knew
Think I've gotta
let myself start off
from the beginning
Let myself float into the waters
I don't know
Think I'm just gonna follow
I'm just gonna follow
Leave it all behind
I've gotta let myself
Start over
Start over
I'll leave the worries alone
I'll let them fade away
Won't have to face those doubts
cause now I'm not the same
And like the tide passes
by now they're gone
All the words that used to hurt
And now I'm drifting
I'm drifting away
to somewhere else
Think I've gotta
let myself start off
from the beginning
Let myself float into the waters
I don't know
Think I'm just gonna follow
I'm just gonna follow
Leave it all behind
I've gotta let myself
Start over
Start over
Think I'm just gonna follow
I'm just gonna follow
Leave it all behind
I've gotta let myself
Start over

A Case Of You,"1,989",James Blake,"Just before our love
got lost you said
I am as constant
as a northern star
And I said Constantly
in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me
I'll be in the bar
On the back of
a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face sketched
on it twice
You're in my blood
you're my holy wine
You taste so bitter
and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case
of you darling
I would still be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones
that ain't afraid
I remember that time
you told me
Love is touching souls
But surely you touched mine
Cause part of you
pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
You're in my blood
you're my holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case
of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils
and your deeds
And she said
Go to him stay
with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed
You're in my blood
you're my holy wine
You taste so bitter
and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case
of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet"

Wake Me Up (Avicii By Avicii),"2,828",Avicii,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost"

So make it last
You got some brand new sneakers
Little darling lace up, darling lace up
And make it fast

They'll try to make you talk
Don't give them nothing
You're up against the wall
Waiting for judgement
Open your prison door
Nobody's watching

You only get one shot
You better run for your life
You better run for your life

Is it everything you dream of
And that you've got your eyes up, got your eyes up
Off the ground
You hear me yelling at your treason
Little rebel rise up, go and rise up
And make us proud

They'll feed you sense and doubt
Play on your conscience
But you'd rather risk it all
Fighting for justice
Here's what you waited for
Everyone's watching

You only get one shot
You better run for your life
You better run for your life

They'll try to make you talk
Don't give them nothing
You're up against the wall
Waiting for judgement

But I believe that we could be so amazing
Uuh, you got me moving like a freak, no
And you're the reason why I'm drinking

Stay sane
Her scent all over me
Try again
I loose myself too frequently
And my brain has caught me up in love again
Time don't Change and I always fall in to deep
But I can't give the things that you need
And I'll be trying hard, but I find I'm too weak that shits left for future me

Something About You,"4,111",Elderbrook,"I miss the touch of morning sun
Making silhouettes of us
Way back when we had our paradise
We're staying up out
through the night
Smoking drinking getting high
I was wrong and I apologize
Where did you go What can I do
I'm working on my problems
But I need you here to solve them
Where did you go
What should I say
I hope that I can make
a change 'cause
There's something 'bout you
Keeping me sober
I was drowning in the moment
But now I'm holding onto you
There's something 'bout you
Keeping me sober
I was drowning in the moment
But now I'm holding onto you
There's something 'bout you
That keeps picking me up
when I'm low
There's something 'bout you
That keeps picking me up
when I'm low
I miss the company we had
Back when I was still on track
Now I'm making my own paradise
But now the drink
is tasting strange
And the high isn't the same
Well I'm still wrong
and I apologize
Where did you go What can I do
I'm working on my problems
But I need you here to solve them
Where did you go

All Around the World (feat. Bryn Christopher),964,Matoma,"You and me were never
meant to be forever na na
Take control for one night

Bring some energy
put some memories in my mind
Dancing in the moonlight
don't be polite it's not or never
The way you roll your eyes
So low I get so high
I think you're crazy think I like it
The way that body moves
So cold when you cut loose
Some kind of crazy I can't hide it
So take me baby
Love me all around the world
So many places I've never been
Love me all around the world
All around the world
All around the world
Something beautiful about
the way you're feeling yourself
Give me all of your truth
roll me out
I'm down for whatever
Dancing over my way
you do me like no one else
No one moving like you honey
you are my new forever
The way you roll your eyes
So low I get so high
I think you're crazy think I like it

So cold when you cut loose
Some kind of crazy I can't hide it

We Are the Young,"1,309",Addal,"We are the young the rising suns
Of our Mother Earth
We're living everyday for all its worth
'Cause from the second it's begun
The clock is counting down
To the night that our light is not around
So we're bleeding dry the moment
Legends in our time
We're carving our initials in this world
More than actin' like we own it
Bound to fall and climb
Beneath the generation's flag unfold
For as long as we are young
We're gonna hang along a ledge
Not afraid of heights or even letting go
For as long as we are young
We're gonna take it to the edge
Not afraid to die
but scared of growing old
We don't need a guarantee
Meant to reassure
Uncertainty is always at our door
The price we pay for being free
Is never knowing when
What's ahead to be tread
we'll reach the end
So we're bleeding dry the moment
Legends in our time
We're carving our initials in this world
More than actin' like we own it
Bound to fall and climb
Beneath the generations flag unfold
For as long as we are young
We're gonna hang along a ledge
Not afraid of heights or even letting go
For as long as we are young
We're gonna take it to the edge
Not afraid to die
but scared of growing old
For as long as we are young
We're gonna hang along a ledge
Not afraid of heights or even letting go
For as long as we are young
We're gonna take it to the edge
Not afraid to die

Not afraid of heights or even letting go
Not afraid to die

Back In The Days (feat. Lasso the Sun),207,Wildvibes,"Back in the days
we fought and then we fell
and we stood up
Back in the days
we took a ride through hell
but stayed intact
Back in the days
we did before we thought
and came out new
Back in the days
we got busted
we got caught
and we slipped through
Like water slowly carving stone
Oh we change somehow
Time’s shaped these bodies
of our own
Oh we’re better now
Oh we change somehow
Oh we’re better now
Oh we change somehow
Oh we’re better now
Back in the days
we swayed and lost control
and went down well
Back in the days
we lost our heart and soul
so we’d excel
Back in the days
we were lied to
we were played
and learned what’s fake
Back in the days
we bent and did not break
we did not break
Like water slowly carving stone
Oh we change somehow
Time’s shaped these bodies
of our own
Oh we’re better now
Oh we change somehow
Oh we’re better now
Oh we change somehow
Oh we’re better now

Can't take another sleepless
night where you stay out till 4am
And never tell me
where you've been
Cause you like you
fuckin' with my head
So I'm walking away
but I know I'll be back again
Cause it only takes one thing
It only takes one drink at a party
It only takes one call for me

Born to Ride,137,Alan Walker,"Head to my heart
Hand on your chest
I have the best of intentions
I've played my part
But who did the rest
Don't wasting breath on redemption

Who do you love when it isn't me
'Cause we fall apart inevitably
Sometimes what you want
Just ain't what you need
And you know me

Baby, I was born to run
Baby, I was born to run
Ain't nobody ever gonna slow me down
'Cause I
I'm looking for the number one
Only me, myself and I
Ain't nobody ever gonna hold me down
Baby, I was born to run

Hand to the wind
Head in the sky
Yeah baby that's where I'm headed
But you fenced me in
For too long a time
So, let's forgive and forget it

I'm not the one, it's easy to see
'Cause we fall apart inevitably
Sometimes what you want
Just ain't what you need
And you know me

Baby, I was born to run

I’ll be telling you how

And the pain will turn to healing

Would you love me till it hurts

My whole life
I've felt like a burden
I think too much and I hate it
I'm so used to being
in the wrong
I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home

Wanna Say Sorry,76,just Fede,"I feel the morning light coming through the curtains
The sun is heating my face
A little tired of looking hours at the ceiling
Oh I just couldn’t embrace

All the things that I’ve said and I couldn’t take back
The way that my head is screaming that I’m a mess
I wanna say sorry for who I am
but there’s no need to be delusional

Step outta bed cause I’m blinded by the daylight
But I cannot complain
Cause as long as I’m waking up with sunshine
Then I’m grateful again

All the things that I’ve said and I couldn’t take back
Made me a better version of myself
I wanna say sorry
but I can’t help that I’m not your kind of Superman

(Aah)
(Of myself)

All the things that I’ve said and I couldn’t take back
The way that my head is screaming that I’m a mess
I wanna say sorry for who I am

Well, you took me with a glance
I should've took the last bus home

And now we go steady to the pictures

And my father, he's going crazy
He says I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night
It's alright, alright

And it's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the street again
I disobeyed another warning
I should've been in by ten
And I won't get out 'til Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
Oh, but it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the ends

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night
It's alright, alright

And I'm dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
And I'm dancing in the moonlight

You wished it bad
You come in here spading
more than who you are
You are who you are
Say you lived both ways
You've got these
troubles day after day
It would all serves the same
I'm not listening to a word you say
Thanks for a second chance
But let me tell you something
I understand go fuck yourself
Don't tell me that
you are who you are
You are who you are
It's only been a minute
since you knocked me
Now you're tryina
treat me like you love me
But I'm not fooled by you
Cause you are who you are
You are who you are
Say you lived both ways
You've got these
troubles day after day
It would all serves the same
I'm not listening to a word you say
You're forever taking aim
You've got these
troubles day after day
My patience was away
I'm not listening to a word you say
I've turned down cause I'm tired
You're telling me that
I'm shut all the time
Can I come babe
Every word you say
drives me away
Say you lived both ways
You've got these
troubles day after day
It would all serves the same
I'm not listening to a word you say"
All We Know (Feat. Phoebe Ryan),"4,225",The Chainsmokers,"Fighting flames of fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart
still we hold together
We've passed the end
so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the world
Down the streets right
through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me
Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right
through the window
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
Never face each other
One but different covers
We don’t care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart
still we hold together
We've passed the end
so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the world
Down the streets right
through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast

Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right

To many places
And I know there's a reason why
Whatever I do
And the day that I met you
I would always find the way to make it right
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime
Everyday is a winding road
You gotta ride it
'Cause I know that I can't be wrong
Whatever I do
And as long as you're with me
We would always find the strength to carry on
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime

And these are the days of our life's
And these are the days of the days
Of your life

Of your life

It's how we learn and it's how we grow
I gotta be patient
All it takes is to let it go
I need to know
Even if the lights go out
Will you ever be the one who stay right by my side
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime

And these are the days of our life's
And these are the days of the days
Of your life

Of your life

We would always find the strength to carry on
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime
And these are the days of our life's
Of your life

Breaking what's already broke

got the right to choose
Over time you’ll see that now
you’ve broken up with me
you’ve made the wrong call
Should I have seen it coming
Out of nothing
Were you running all along
You gotta give me something
now you leave me on my own
Girl you know it hurts me
You gotta give me
something baby
try to open up
Are you telling me it’s pointless
are you telling me to stop
Ever since we’ve met
you made me feel alive
Now you make me survive
don’t you break me
You gotta give me
something baby
try to open up
Are you telling me it’s pointless
are you telling me to stop
Ever since we’ve met
you made me feel alive
Now you make me survive
don’t you break me
Now you’ve left without a word
leave me guessing
what is wrong with you
Was it me or something
that I didn’t do
that made you suddenly change
I find it hard to find the words
see me drowning here in solitude
Could it be that you have
never really told me
that we've turned the wrong page
Should I have seen it coming
Out of nothing
Were you running all along
You gotta give me something
now you leave me on my own
Girl you know it hurts me
You gotta give me something baby
try to open up
Are you telling me it’s pointless
are you telling me to stop
Ever since we met

Wasting all my twenties making

And you're so close now
They always said you'd make it far
But they failed to mention how
So you keep fighting for that moment
When you can claim it that you own it
And everyone around you knows it
When you look back, it seems so easy
You've been caught in the in between
It's never been enough
But you know this view won't compare
To the one from above
So you keep fighting for that moment
Terrified for you, I show it
All the things you left unspoken
Seem unseen so easy"

It's all we need to win for love
Oh you're the king of the hill
I I'm ready to face
Oh you're the king of the hill
I will take your place
King of the hill
King of the hill
I'm high up now
Ruling like no one has ever seen
I won't allow
For someone to come in
and take my queen
Time to fight
Make yourself a warrior
It's raining arrows from above
Take your shield
Raise it up above your heads
It's all we need to win for love
Oh you're the king of the hill
I I'm ready to face
Oh you're the king of the hill
I will take your place

Love Again (feat. Alida),174,Alok,"When the sun goes up, when the sun goes down
It's been six days now with insomnia
Try to touch my skin but I feel nothing
I just think of you, don't know what to do
Clock is ticking out and I hear the sound
Like an empty soul playing all day long
And I move my feet but I feel nothing
I pretend to smile but I cry inside
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again
When the sun goes up, when the sun goes down
All the things I do to get rid of you
Try to make new friends, try to go outside
And I act okay but it's not the same
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again
Tell me how
How baby, I need to know, oh
Tell me how
How 'cause my heart's icy cold, oh
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn
Learn to love-love-love-love again
Tell me how will I-I-I ever learn-learn-learn

Sparks flying from the sun

can I confess
I feel your heart beatin'

Tonight is gonna be the one

You pull hope from
defeat in the night

than we did before

is a heart that works
From a broken place

Seems so clear then the breakup
I reach out
always wake up cold alone
Between what's real
and becoming ghosts
Blue sky days on the rainy coast

I miss the days that we'd chill and relax

Only thing I did was take out the trash
Now It's much harder to laugh
Hard to get up and then work on my craft

Should try some meditating

Well maybe I'm done, maybe I've lost
Still putting up a fight because
I love my mom, I love my family
When I was young they would all look after me

I spend my life overthinking my purpose
Can't really cry, I'm so used to the hurting
Trauma creeps up on me at the wrong moments

Never Really Loved Me (with Dean Lewis),893,Kygo,"You say you only ever wanted love

Just like the summer
steals the memories

with a broken sword
Now I’m caught in a war
with no shield

Say you’ll stay with me forever
Then I surrender surrender
If you hold me now
and leave me never
Say you’ll stay with me forever
Then I surrender surrender

I pushed and pulled
all the ones that tried
Then I watched them fade away
As I look around a vacant room
I see nobody left here to blame
‘Cause I made myself a prisoner
Shackled up by all my fears
But I feel you breaking away
at the walls
Make them fall make
them all disappear

Rise up the sea, oh let me be
And let the waves crash over me

Let go of reasons, surrender to fate
The apple of Eden is all yours to taste
Nobody's perfect and things will be rough
Love conquers all, so let there be love

To tell you out of all the
moments in my life
The ones I got to share with you
Were probably my favourite
I know you're looking down on us
Yeah I'm missing you bro
I hope you're proud of us
At least I know you made it home
And I know you're not alone
Cause now you're singing
with a choir
Now you're dancing with a crew

We fight like lions
We howl at the moon
We should be flying
Instead we bury the truth
But I know inside
we're beautiful creatures
beautiful
We're beautiful creatures
When your highs are low
keep the faith yeah
Cause you know that a life's

Standing tall shaking off the dust

You say I'm asymptomatic
'Cause I don't show any remorse
I'm super over dramatic
Oh since the day I was born
I'm really trying to be better
I know how fragile you are
But we need to move on together
We'll be so much better apart

Looking For Love,29,Fini,"Your Cartiers cover my eyes
Is anyone reading me right
Am I someone you want to hold
Or am I the mystery you fight
I’m always looking for unlikely heroes
I’m always looking past me
Combing the VCR for 90’s B-roll
Where will haunted past be
You know we’re looking for love
We’re all just looking for love
I cry as I open my eyes
The longing has kept me alive
Am I the one relic you chose
Could you and me finally be right
I’m always looking for unlikely heroes
I’m always looking past me
Combing the VCR for 90’s B-roll
Where will haunted past be
You know we’re looking for love
We’re all just looking for love"

When I smell that perfume in the street
Pieces of my past all come together
Fly right through my head
Something 'bout our love
Could not last forever
How can I forget?
When I drink rose wine
Oh I hear Harry Styles
If I wake up at three
I think of you and me

No matter wherе I'm gonna be
I think of you and me
Think of you and me
I think of you and me
When I talk about my childhood
Or look at picturs from my youth
I find it so hard
to remember the details
But I know every part of you
Pieces of my past all come together
Fly right through my head
Something 'bout our love
Could not last forever
How can I forget?

Do you always look so god damn fine
Yeah you must be tired
from all of the time
you spent running through my mind
Cause I could really be your guy
The one you've been searching
for the whole of your life
Come to my place and be who you want to
And do what you want to
But do the right thing
And let me show you what you're missing
Oh can you feel it
It's something special and I mean it
I can give you heaven if you want it
Just promise me girl you can handle it
And oh I wanna please you
Wanna treat you to a thing or two
I can give you heaven if you want me to
Just give me the word and it's done for you
You said you wanted paradise
A place to sip champagne on ice
And put those diamonds in your eyes
Everything I do girl
I do it all for you girl
Oh I really wanna please you
Wanna treat you to a thing or do
I can give you heaven if you want me to
Just give me the word and it's done for you"

Deadwater,"1,786",WET,"If I could be stronger
And if you were just older
We might last this out longer
But the task just gets harder
And my face turned to red
From drinking all that dead water
And the again when you said
That I was my mother’s daughter
Shaky when he comes to me
Shaky but I believe
Shaky and I’m on my knees
There are better things for me
Shaky when I came to be
When they left
they left me in pieces
Shaky but I believe
There are better things for me
If my legs were longer
They might carry us further
But we waited too long
And so the task just gets harder
And the thoughts that come in
They come on stronger and stronger
And it takes all of me
To just stay out of the water
Shaky when he comes to me
Shaky but I believe
Shaky and I’m on my knees
There are better things for me
Shaky when I came to be
When they left
they left me in pieces
Shaky but I believe
When you left
you left for a reason
Ohhhh take me to the things
I see I see
My eyes can reach passed all
that’s been laid out for me
Shaky when he comes to me

There are better things for me

to going too far
So now I'm running like you
set me free out in the wild
I know you want me to come home

I got my heart in my hands while
my head's up in the clouds
And only heaven knows
if I will make it back to you
So I I just keep running
And I said oh
And only heaven knows
if I will make it back
Where the sand runs into the
ocean's where I'll get lost
And let the raindrops fall
all around the castle of cards
Faced with the lions I felt the
courageleading my head
Cause even I know every battle
leaves you with scars
So now I'm running like you
set me free out in the wild
I know you want me to come home

Young & Reckless,429,Jason Thurell,"Yesterday
We were young and reckless
We didn't want it any other way (other way)
And we we would stay out late, waiting for the sunset
Dancing on the moonlight 'til the day
When life was chasing fate
It would be easy getting drunk
'Cause we didn't give a fuck
When love was just a game
We couldn't keep it on the ground
We break often, we rebound
First time you said my name
You would never gonna break my heart
The same way you're my tomorrow
If flames go out
And you think it's time to grow up
Just think about the times we spent together
Just can't hold away thinking 'bout the future
Let the sunshine in our souls guide the way
Let's just save it 'til the day
'Cause if it was our last one hopes
And feelings and will never walk away
When life was chasing fate
It would be easy getting drunk
'Cause we didn't give a fuck
When love was just a game
We couldn't keep it on the ground
We break often, we rebound
First time you said my name
You were never gonna break my heart
The same way you're my tomorrow
If flames go out
And you think it's time to grow up
Just think about the times we spent together
First time you said my name
You were never gonna break my heart
The same way you're my tomorrow
If flames go out
And you think it's time to grow up
Just think about the times we spent together
First time you said my name

The same way you're my tomorrow

the things that I once knew
I don't know
if you want a second guess
I was playing an actor in a film
that I outgrew
Trying out one
trying not to forget
I don't know if you wanna know
the person in my past
If you do
then I'll let you take the blame
We can grow we can move
we can shift
We can always rearrange
Never commit
never remain the same
So when you say my name
Remember that I've changed
Remember all the things
that we've done
Our hearts are interlaced
with all the better days
With all the rising stars
and the sun
I don't know if you wanna know
the things that I once knew
I don't know
if you want a second guess
I was playing an actor
in a film that I outgrew
Trying out one
trying not to forget
Wanna know why you gotta know
what lives under my bed
Wanna know
why you can't live day to day
If I could find a map to the key
to what's locked in my head
I'd make it sail
I'd make it sail away
So when you say my name
Please tell me that I've changed
Please tell me
I'm not who I once was
Our hearts are interlaced
with all the better days
With all the falling stars
and the sun
I don't know if you wanna know
the things that I once knew
I don't know
if you want a second guess
I was playing an actor
in a film that I outgrew
Trying out one
trying not to forget
I don't know if you wanna know
the things that I once knew
I don't know
if you want a second guess
I was playing an actor
in a film that I outgrew
Trying out one
trying not to forget"

be more to life than this

With me tonight
Trying to find
A place in this world
Reaching for the stars
traveling so far
Like a dragonfly
Keep our secrets there
hide them everywhere
Just you and I
Just you and I
We'll never forget the past
But what counts is
our brand new start
Even if it hurts me
or I get scared
Just come take this risk now
we'll be prepared
Trying to find
A place in this world
Reaching for the stars
traveling so far
Like a dragonfly
Keep our secrets there
hide them everywhere
Just you and I

A place in this world"
Movies (Alex Ghenea Remix),693,FRND,"Roll the credits on us
Did it turn out the way
the way you were dreaming of
Except with a different ending
Did you get it what you want
Did we feel it coming
coming for us all along
Or were we both just pretending
It's not like the movies
This is way more real
It's not how I imagined
The way that I would feel
You're the star and I'm the screen
I play back my favorite scene
Where you still love me
You still love me
I know by now it's overdue
Now I should be over you
I don't mean to but I still need you
Roll the credits on us
Did it turn out the way
the way you were dreaming of
Except with a different ending
I couldn't read between the lines
I didn't know I didn't try
Wish we saw our name in lights
But we were blind
It's not like the movies
This is way more real
It's not how I imagined
The way that I would feel
You're the star and I'm the screen
I play back my favorite scene
Where you still love me
You still love me
I know by now it's overdue
Now I should be over you
I don't mean to but I still need you
I still need you
I still need you
I still need you
I still need you

حكايه عن يقين وقوة وامل
يملها الطوح وغنت الاجيال
حدود الكون ما عادت تكفينا

Step into the unknown
Cause this is where dreams are born
Million miles away
But it still feels like home

In the land of heroes

Step into the unknown"

Don't Trust Me (Explicit Album Ver.),0,3OH!3,"Black dress with the tights underneath

I've got the breath of a last cigarette on my teeth

And she's an actress but she ain't got no need

She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east





T-t-tongues always pressed to your cheeks

While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth

You tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef

That I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him





She wants to touch me, woo ooh

She wants to love me, woo ooh

She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh

Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho

Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me





She wants to touch me, woo ooh

She wants to love me, woo ooh

She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh

Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho

Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me





X's on the back of your hands

Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands

And the set list, you stole off the stage

Has red and purple lipstick all over the page





B-b-bruises cover your arms

Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm

And the best is, no one knows who you are

Just another girl alone at the bar





She wants to touch me, woo ooh

She wants to love me, woo ooh

She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh

Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho

Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me





She wants to touch me, woo ooh

She wants to love me, woo ooh

She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh

Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho

Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me





Shush girl, shut your lips

Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips

I said shush girl, shut your lips

Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips

I said shush girl, shut your lips

Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips





She wants to touch me, woo ooh

She wants to love me, woo ooh

She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh

Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho

Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me





She wants to touch me, woo ooh

She wants to love me, woo ooh

She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh

Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho

Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me"

Maybe I'll get you out of my head
Maybe I'll forget all the things you said
Lies on your lips, but there's love in your eyes
Maybe I'll forget you some other time
Why do I let you cross the line every time
Why do I stay if I know you're not mine
Ride on your skin, I know that love used to glow
How can I let you go if I know I'm so close

Away from the hands of the youth
Hold fast cause the
daylights coming

Take it if it's yours to take
Go sleep in the bed that you made
I know its never been easy
To say what you never could say
You'll wait so long
Don't wait so long
I've been counting
all the passing days
You keep hiding in the back room
It's taken awhile to find you
covered in blue
Hey been watching
as you walk away
From all you leave in the past
I never thought I could save you
Even if it's the last thing I do
Move on cause the world is moving
Along right in front of you
If you don't stop for awhile
You might miss a perfect view
You'll wait so long
Don't wait so long

all the passing days
You keep hiding in the back room
It's taken awhile to find you

Hey been watching
as you walk away
From all you leave in the past
I never thought I could save you
Even if it's the last thing I do
I won't stop and go and
let another day unfold
I miss the feeling that you
get when you can have it all
I won't stop and go and

Starlight raining over me
Like drifting through a memory
Wake up in your crystal sky

through the night
Illuminating coastlines
Headlights toward the afterlife
Bright enough to shine
Colors fade into the waves
Swimming through reality

All That She Wants,"1,307",Campsite Dream,"When she woke up late
in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
oh what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching sun
Just laying on the beach
and having fun
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby oh
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby oh
So if you are in sight
and the day is right
She's the hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
won't talk forever
It's a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's gonna get you
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby oh
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby oh"

no matter what they say
And when the thieves
try to steal your faith
Keep pushin' through 'em

Stripped to my shadow on the floor
Like the broken bones
inside my body
I will be stronger than before
You gotta take it day by day
Keep movin' forward
no matter what they say
And when the thieves
try to steal your faith
Keep pushin' through 'em
'cause there ain't no other way
If you wanna get stronger
No we don't break
no we don't break
Stronger stronger
No we don't break
no we don't break
Stronger stronger
No we don't break

Stronger stronger

did you ever wonder
Maybe we're meant to be

Crashing cars again

To stop from falling
Will I ever understand

Dirt on the soles of my feet
They say, Come here where the air is sweet
Play the game we're playing
I heard them saying
Here's where you lose your mind
The water here's divine
You're doing just fine
Come on darling

I'll reach for you and remember

My Life Is Going On (Cecilia Krull vs Gavin Moss),"1,714",Cecilia Krull,"If I stay with you
if I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all
If I'm losing now
but I'm winning late
That's all I want
Now we need some space
'cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone
it seems so short
I can't explain
I don't care at all
I don't care at all
I will be so strong
looking for a new version
of myself
Cause now all I want is
to be a part of my new world
Whatever happens in the future
trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything
else even when you feel
I don't care at all
I don't care at all"
Sleep (Feat. Liv Dawson & Courage),440,Conducta,"Can we just?
Sunlight, eyes wide shut
Close the curtains
Give me time
I’m still dreaming of last night
Can we just sleep all day?
Can we sit and talk
about our dreams all day?
I’ll live here in your sheets
And baby, with your loving you
can cover me
(Can we just?)
High times, red skies
I’m not ready
Turn off the light
Still dreaming of last night
Can we just sleep all day?
Can we sit and talk about
our dreams all day?
I’ll live here in your sheets
And baby, with your loving
you can cover me
Can we just sleep all day?
Can we sit and talk about
our dreams all day?
And I’ll live here in your sheets
And baby, with your loving
you can cover me
’Cause I want this thing to last for life
And we come alive at night
So why can’t we make the talk our life?
And you stay here by my side
So stay on the ground,
let’s not take flight
And don’t say it's wrong,
it feels too right
Stay on the ground,
let’s not take flight
Sun’s coming up, my love, good night
Night, night
Can we just sleep all day?
Can we sit and
talk about our dreams all day?
And I’ll live here in your sheets
And baby, with your loving you

Yes you do
Time square can't shine
as bright as you
I swear it's true

Don't you worry
about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice it's my disguise
I'm by your side
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

But just believe me girl
Someday I'll pay the bills
with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life
we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Wish You Were Here,790,Vicetone,"It never goes how you wanted

each other through
the summer under covers
Then spent January
sleeping back to back
God knows I still want you like
the moment that I met you
But it takes the both of us
to make it last
When you hold me at a distance
I can tell that something's missing
Like I blinked and
your heart disappeared
'Cause even when you're
right beside me
With your arms wrapped around me
I still wish,
I still wish you were here
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Nothing breaks like a promise
From somebody you trust
Were you being dishonest?
Or did you just say too much?
How we went from wrapped around
each other through
the summer under covers
Then spent January
sleeping back to back
God knows I still want you like
the moment that I met you

When you're far away
the isolation gets the best of me
It's a recipe I know all to well
And I try to vocalise
Exactly what I'm doing wrong
When you're face is filled with tears
Coz you tried to compromise
But you really can't go on
You've had it up to here
Now I would always want you
As a lover as a friend
But some days a man
needs space from his relationship
It ain't hard to comprehend
It's hard to say no
It's hard to say no
I've been around the world and back
I know what you associate with that
I know you have trouble trusting me
But I held my own
but I held my own
It doesn't take away from the fact
Something changed
the minute I came back
I have'nt felt the same
from not seeing you so long
Now I try to rationalise
Exactly what I'm doing wrong
When your face to face with fears
I know you tried to compromise
But you really can't go on
You've had it up to here
Now I would always want you
As a lover as a friend
But some days a man needs
space from his relationship
It ain't hard to comprehend
It's hard to say no
It's hard to say no
It's hard to say no
It's hard to say no
Now I would always want you
As a lover as a friend
But some days a man needs
space from his relationship

Tom's Diner (Feat. Britney Spears),"5,955",Giorgio Moroder,"I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in
It is always nice to see you
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
I'm pretending not to see them
Instead I pour the milk
Everybody's welcome
Come on come on in
Sit yourself down
The funnies never end
Love is the drug
That makes you want to drink
Till the morning after oh
I open up the paper
There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope
Looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me
And so I raise my head"

What I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive

Where are you now
Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire

In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink 182 song
That we beat to death
in Tucson okay

Back home for the weekend
And I'm overthinking
I know you sense it I'm being distant
I've felt this before
But this time can't ignore
I know you're gettin' back home
in an airplane
'Bout to leave LA
But there's something I gotta say
I know you know
but I don't wanna tell you
It hurts me it hurts you
But that's what I have to do
Will I still feel this when I see you
Will we still be us when I see you
Will I still feel this when I see you
Will we still be us when I see you
My friends don't know yet
Haven't told my parents
With nowhere to start
Damn I'm falling apart
I know you're nervous
I hate the fact
that we're up in the air
While you're up in the air
let me know
when your phone's off airplane mode
Just got back into town
Baby I'm freakin' out
How do we even start
this conversation
I'm crying just thinking about
We haven't talked about
Will I still feel this when I see you
Will we still be us when I see you
Will I still feel this when I see you

Back To You (feat. Koa),378,Altero,"Summer nights under pretty lights
Drunk fights and
we're faded till daylight
Elevated when it's you and me
Separated
and I'm feeling like I can't breathe
Every now and then
I find myself thinking
How I let it come to this
Where every night I'm drinking
But I'm sure it's no surprise
It's how I'm movin' on from you
Dizzy
and I'm spinnin’ in the headlights
Feeling love sick going all night
Gave you all I got took a shot
Now I'll take another shot
and I'll take another shot oh
Dizzy
and I'm spinnin in the headlights
Feeling love sick going all night
Gave you all I got took a shot
Now I'm never coming back
No I'm never coming back to
You-
Sun rays in a summer haze
Flashback
going back to the good days
Rewind sunshine
it was you and me
Now it's over and
I'm feeling like I can't breathe
I miss the way you sleep
The sound of your heartbeat
But you're no good for me
The hardest thing to do is leave
And when I'm feeling down
And I need you
I think of all the things
That we've been through
Caught up in the heat of emotions
Everything we've built is broken
Dizzy
and I'm spinnin in the headlights
Feeling love sick going all night
Gave you all I got took a shot
Now I'll take another shot
and I'll take another shot oh
Dizzy
and I'm spinnin in the headlights
Feeling love sick going all night
Gave you all I got took a shot
Now I'm never coming back
No I'm never coming back to
You-
Dizzy
and I'm spinnin in the headlights
Feeling love sick going all night
Gave you all I got took a shot
Now I'll take another shot
and I'll take another shot oh
Dizzy
and I'm spinnin in the headlights
Feeling love sick going all night
Gave you all I got took a shot

No I'm never coming back to"
Relapse,76,Satin Jackets,"Waking up to a feeling, the best we had
If it looks like we mean it don't take it back
Is it better to ignore it or better when we relapse?
'Cause I'm lost in the beating, don't move too fast
If it looks like I'm leading, I'll roll it back
Is it better to ignore it or better when we relapse?

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Giving up to the demons but it won't last
If it looks like I'm bleeding, I'll take the chance
Is it better to ignore it or better when we relapse?
I'm lost in the weekends just take my hand
'Cause I can't help but feed it, can't stop this dance
Is it better to ignore it or better when we relapse?

When we started, didn't I take control?
When you slowed it down, didn't I even notice

That we could handle the quiet, you could handle the cold
We never let it be something over letting things go, but
It's still in my memory, didn't we have some hope?

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

We don't need a reason to fall in
I don't need a reason to lose myself
We don't need a reason for calling up
Better feeling something than leaving nothing
We don't need a reason to fall in
I don't need a reason to lose myself
We don't need a reason for calling up
Better feeling something than leaving nothing"

I know you've been
watching me too
You're the type of girl
In demand and loves to dance
to make the boys go insane
If you're the type of girl
Drink in hand and loves the sand
Then baby I'm your man
Let me take you where the sun goes
I can make
your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby we can leave
our shadows behind

Like animals in the wild
We could play all day and
all night underneath the stars

In demand and loves to dance

Drink in hand and loves the sand

Guess who's rollin
in the snowed out Jeep
On fleek
Got an extra seat
if you wanna roll
with me and be free
Ooooooh weee
let the games begin
Turn up volume on ten
What a feeling no ceiling
Hands up hair
blowing in the wind
Two villains on the run
Two kids following the sun
Footprints in the sand
Skipping rocks
Holding hands Knee deep
in the white wash
It's getting late but
we ain't done yet
Til the coast guard take
our postcard by the sunset
Me and You sipping
Malibu with a view
Let me take you
where the sun goes
I can make
your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby we can leave
our shadows behind
Leave our shadows behind
Leave our shadows behind"

Been high since yesterday
You know it kills the pain
It's hard to find a love
through every shade of grey
So tired of the same
Never seems to change
It's hard to find a love

I don't know if I can take
Another call another night
in the city
Chasing the spark
that got lost in the dark
Left these scars
but I think they're pretty
So I say Hey
Been high since yesterday
You know it kills the pain

Been a lot of places
And none of them were home
Always told myself that I'd be
Better off alone
Float up from my body
Been longing for the moon
Look her in the eye and tell her
I'ma see you soon

Run It (feat. Annika Wells),"1,078",Midnight Kids,"I remember when, in the summer winds
We would speed down the 405, playing The Who
With the red lights and adrenaline
We had young blood in our veins and dirt on our shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
But you sold that car the year you finished school
And I stopped wearing that faded pair of shoes
We got so wrapped up in the clouds, we fell through
Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh!

We just want to stay this young for
Every day the bills keep coming
All the bullshit we're all stuck in
Take me back to, when we'd just drive
Think it's time that we said fuck it
Red light! Let's run it

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting in line, on the 405
When the same song that we'd sing is playing outside (Is playing outside)
I got the windows up but I can hear enough
For it to bring me back to the way we loved
Feeling so big, feeling sober, feeling alive

But you sold that car the year you finished school

We got so wrapped up in the clouds, we fell through

Without notice she flew back

Tried explaining to her boss
Said he had to lay her off
She called I said hi
Her brother drove
Left her drinking lost control
Salty with feathers barely dry
The next month her father died

With wounds so sharp
that they cut too fast
Runnin' when the sky comes down
Growin' more cracks
when you can't be found yeah
I took your heart
and made it mine
Do my best to justify it
Call it pleasure
but it feels like pain
So how'd we let it get this way
Your broken heart was
just like mine
We built these walls
and hid inside 'em
I said I wouldn't let you in
And now you know I'm paper-thin
And now you know I'm paper-thin
And now you know I'm paper-thin
Maybe I'll just let you down
But look at those eyes
I'm thinkin' too loud
Maybe I'll just bide my time
So when it feels right
you can be mine yeah
Didn't know I'd be so late
Drinking all night
numbing that shame
Guessing I'll be careful now
I'm holding your past
I'll carry you out

for certain right now
but then again
If I lost you I never could be
your friend again
Doubts creep up inside us
if we both let 'em in
Unless we both never
lettin' that question enterin'

First time how did you get there

Hate You,173,Jim Yosef,"I don’t recognize who’s in my bed
I know I used to love him but I can’t pretend
All we do is scream and fight
Cruel through the day, selfish lover at night
Am I stranger to you too?
Don’t love me like you promised to
So why am I so sad to leave you?
Yeah
Why am I
Doing everything I can to justify your arrogance
Your cruelty, and your neglect? I can’t pretend cause
I know there’s no saving us now
This point I’m just burnt out from pleasing you
I hate that, I hate that, I hate that I hate you
Stone cold to the touch
Eyes vacant, you’re not enough
So selfish, can’t keep up
I hate that, I hate that, I hate that I hate you
Hate that I hate you
Do you think about it like I do?
Is it me in your mind when you’re with someone new?
Tryna map out in my head
How we got here from where we started
Take or leave, I should have gone
Got stuck tryna right your wrongs
Doing what I can I compromised and bled I
Got down on my knees for nothing cause you’re
Stone cold to the touch
Eyes vacant, you’re not enough
So selfish, can’t keep up
I hate that, I hate that, I hate that I hate you
Hate that I hate you
I know there’s no saving us now
This point I’m just burnt out
From pleasing you, from pleasing you, from pleasing you

I know there’s no saving us now
This point I’m just burnt out
From pleasing you, from pleasing you, from pleasing you
Yeah baby I know there’s no saving us now
This point I’m just burnt out
From pleasing you
I hate that I hate you
Hate that I hate you
Hate that I, hate that I, hate that I hate you
Hate that I hate you

Sorry,"2,608",Aquilo,"The note you wrote upon the shelf
I frozen there in silver doubt
My heart was breaking by the shore
And I couldn't give you anymore

And I'm still shaken
And crawling back again
And all my brothers
And all my sisters are gone

I'm sorry that I've let you go
I'm sorry that I've cared
I'm sorry that the feeling showed
And I just wasn't there

And reminded of the fool I was
I cut you off and fucked it up again
I'm sorry that I've let you go
I'm sorry that I've cared

This pillow case smells of you
And time itself stops to prove
And for a moment nothing changed
And everything stays the same

And I'm still shaken
And crawling back again
And all my brothers
And all my sisters are gone

I'm sorry that I've let you go
I'm sorry that I've cared
I'm sorry that the feeling showed
And I just wasn't there

And reminded it the fool I was
I cut you off and fucked it up again
I'm sorry that I've let you go
I'm sorry that I've cared

I left the light on
So you could see me in the dark
But then it blinded us
And left us who we are

I'm sorry that I've let you go
I'm sorry that I've cared
I'm sorry that the feeling showed
And I just wasn't there

In a cold cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry

we're bleeding
So deep that
we might not get back up

But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper just a papercut
I find refuge in a distance
Even when we're breaking down
down down down down
Can't we pause it just for one kiss
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
Cause I never meant to hurt you
And I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to

So deep that

Introducing all these hands but I'm out of luck

For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Is there anything you need
Make you feel more comfortable
Put your mind at ease

So what do I do instead
When I think about every single thing
Nodding through my head
Keeping me inside

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Broken,"1,106",DNMO,"I don't even want to watch it last
I just wanna bask in shattered glass
Pick each fragment up one at a time
Shards inside my skin

Want you to tell me that I'm broken
That I'm finally choking
I'm not worth the rhyme
I'm just a dime, a rusty token
Tell me that I'm fucked up
Mentally unstable
Tell me that I care too much about my whole damn fable
I just want your body
I don't want your mind
I just want a noose around my neck to pass the time
I just want a god, please, rather roll my dice
I don't wanna watch the light
Extinguish from your eyes

Bones are laced with oil
I'll just burn my name, no toil
I just want my way, so spoiled
How are you today

I'll tell you that I'm broken
That I'm finally choking
I'm not worth the rhyme
I'm just a dime, a rusty token
Flooded wishing wells are, where I like to spend my days
I'd bathe in pools to dwell
But wish I could just wash away

Now tell me that I'm
I don't want to watch it last
I won't recycle the past
The way you smile, cannot ever beat that
The space between our laughter always felt sad
Jam a stick between my spokes
I will never feel at home
The way you cry, they cannot ever beat that
The space between our tears had always felt mad
I don't really want to learn
I just want to watch you squirm
In my palm, relax
Hiding in the walls
Don't let go
Takes a certain personality, to drive me to thin sanity

"Never Gonna Let You (Feat. Max S, Dafina)",112,Galavant,"I know every inch of you like the back of my hand
We know everything we do in part of a plan
And we fight over things we shouldn't fight over
And you can make me go mad, like I make you go mad
Same old love, we keep the engine running all the night
So we paint with fading colors covering up all of our lights

Chorus: Max S & Dafina
But I wanna be yours, you know
Holding you till we're old

I know what you're thinking of from the look on your face
We torn and repaired our love in a million ways
We fight over things we shouldn't fight over and
You can make me go mad like I make you go mad

Redemption (Feat. Riell),766,Besomorph,"You say I make you nervous
A tragedy
I'm a beautiful disaster
A reckoning
You wonder how I got this way
You wonder how I got this way
You think I'm someone to be saved
Someone to clean up and tame
Oh somethings never change
never change oh
You think I would look pretty
On your arm
Once you cover up my bruises
And battle scars
But it always ends the same
But it always ends the same
Can't bear the things
I've had to face
Got you crying
on your knees in pain
Oh somethings never change
Never change oh
You'll break your back
to make me feel again
Suffocate to make me breathe again
Lose your mind
from endless praying
Somethings never change
Never change oh
Redemption never came
I stopped asking for forgiveness
Cause you should know
only fools tread
Where the angels
Fear to go
But you keep trying
to get too close
But you keep trying
to get too close
Saved myself by turning into stone
So save your judgment
cause you just don't know
But somethings never change
Never change oh
They say I should feel guilty
And change my ways
Leaving crumpled bodies
In my wake
Swear I didn't mean
to make them break
Swear I didn't mean
to make them break
But they're so delicate
and so mundane
And they keep coming
like a moth to flame
Oh somethings never change
Never change MM
You'll break your back
to make me feel again
Suffocate to make me breathe again
Lose your mind
from endless praying
Somethings never change
Never change oh
Redemption never came"

One Shot,195,Neffex,"No fear, I'm standing right here
Eyes peer, with my mind clear, never look rear
Only up, never down, off the ground
Till I'm found, hear the sound, listen to me now
As the beat pounds every ounce
Of my effort pouring out, so you never have a doubt
Do you like me now Am I good enough now
Should I get more loud, till you hear the fucking sound
Oh no, I'm losing my shit again
Having a fit again, man, I'm forgetting when
I used to have some friends, I used to play pretend
We all grow up and then, hating my phone and trends
I'm 'bout to blow my head, nobody knows I'm dead
Fear I'm a ghost instead, think that I'm close, I get
Straight comatose in bed, try to go slow with breath
Breathe out my nose and head, heart doesn't go the trend
Faster it goes instead

Chorus
One shot, that's all you got
Take it right now, before you get lost, yeah
One shot, that's all you got
Write your own story, you control the plot, yeah

Verse 2
I know that I'm a little OCD
The people close to me already know that's me
That's how it's supposed to, 'cause nobody's perfect
You need something to work towards that's worth it
You need something that's worth more, you deserve it
Find that thing that you love, then preserve it
If you heading down the wrong path, then reverse it
Put your head down and, dammit, start working
'cause we all need a little bit of hope to help us cope
As we go down this road on our own
Never knowing where it goes, always wonder if we're close
Always wonder if we chose the right fork' in the road, who knows
You don't, I don't, is everybody stoned I groan
'cause I'm sick of mediocrity, where's the quality
Everything's about quantity, ironically
We feed our minds constantly but don't think logically, yeah

South,593,Galimatias,"Look me in the eye I'ma take it slow
River running high
when I dive down low
I can go for miles water lets me grow
I'ma have you feeling
like you fly mid air
Slowly getting lost but you do not care
Send you to the stars
as you pull my hair
Lover you'll forget
about your low mood
I'ma wander south
and make you feel good
Travelling your body as a prelude
Lover you'll forget
about your low mood
Ima wander south
and make you feel good
Let me taste your body
like it's soul food
The tide is high
You don't need to tell me nothing girl
Just turn off the light
I might need a regulator
When I go for the dive
The desire made you switch
To your most primitive mind
No sin no sin
Call it meditation
When we both unravel within
Feel the calm before the storm
As is my tongue on your skin
In between your breathing
I can hear the drop of a pin
Cocoa body wash you
know you smell nice
Bring your light upon me
like the sunrise
Bet I burn my tongue
you're like a hot spice
Roll over my body like you want more
Roll on me like water on the seashore
Let me feel your body I want you raw
The tide is high
Got the river running high
In the canyon below
I let my tongue travel
to the end of the road
Until you reach the peak
I won't ever let go
No sin no sin
Call it meditation
When we both unravel within
Feel the calm before the storm
As is my tongue on your skin
In between your breathing
I can hear the drop of a pin
I'ma have you feeling
like you fly mid air
Slowly getting lost
but you do not care
Send you to the stars
as you pull my hair"
So What,429,Louis The Child,"Everybody plays the fool
There's no point in wondering
why people do what they do

But don't lose sight of the truth
Girl it's him it's not you
So what if he don't call
when he's supposed to
So what if he don't care
So what if when you cry
he don't hold you
You don't need him to be there
So what if when you're mad
he says you're crazy
You just make him insecure
No you didn't lose the girl
you used to be
You just let yourself
get a little hurt
But so what
So what
So what
It happens to the best of us
So what
So what
So what
It happens to thе best of us
And you don't have to be ashamеd
For giving everything you got
when they don't know
what they have
Sometimes jumping ain't so safe
But when the parachute
don't open girl
don't feel so bad
'Cause so what if he don't call
when he's supposed to
So what if he don't care
So what if when you cry
he don't hold you

while I'm getting older
My feet are on the ground
and the world feels colder
And oh I wonder if I'll see you again
But when you're crushed
by the patterns that come and go
And bleed into the centerfold
Remember the only thing that matters
I can feel you here feel you there
feel you right baby
I can feel your waist
'cross the space and the time
It hits me like a flood like a stun
like a light like a meteorite
I can feel you here feel you there
feel you right baby
I can feel your waist
'cross the space and the time
It hits me like a flood like a stun
like a light like a meteorite
Our length is dawn into the dusk
You spend it only if you must
We never seem to have enough we tried
You live with all the skeletons
I know I'm not the only one
I'd hate for them to have to come alive
But when you're crushed
by the patterns that come and go
And bleed into the centerfold
Remember the only thing that matters
I can feel you here feel you there

Loneliness,35,Pet Shop Boys,"There is a better fight
A cause close to my heart
A struggle against loneliness
that’s tearing you apart

Where you gonna run to now
from loneliness?
Who you gonna turn to
out of loneliness?

Like Ringo walking by the canal
downcast and alone
You’re taking time to play that part
A man who skims a stone

Where you gonna run to now
from loneliness?
Who you gonna turn to
out of loneliness?

When you gonna not say no
and make the answer yes?
Who is here to help you out?
Oh tell me - Can’t you guess?

Wherever you go
you take yourself with you
There’s nowhere you can hide
from the loneliness
that’s haunting your life
the sense of wounded pride

Everybody needs time to think
Nobody can live without love

Where you gonna run to now
from loneliness?
Who you gonna turn to
out of loneliness?

When you gonna not say no
and make the answer yes?
Who is here to help you out?
Oh tell me - Can’t you guess?

Where you gonna run to now
from loneliness?
When you gonna not say no
and answer yes?

Who you gonna turn to now
from loneliness?
Who could come and help you out?
Oh, can’t you guess?

When you gonna not say no
and make the answer yes?
Who is here to help you
turn your back on loneliness?"

We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the ZZZ's
Popping the polar opposite the NZT

But I done seen how the xan did my main man
The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone 'till November
On my city come December
Dreams are made for cages nigga
Lions are for real nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills nigga

Hissing and circling

when your chest's on top of my heart
I can feel your breath in the dark
Holding me like it's the last time
grabbing me like it's the first time
I'm pretty sure I'll regret it
but I am letting you take it all
'cause when you look at me
I slowly fall towards you
I'm fighting gravity all night
'cause when you look at me
I slowly fall towards you
I'm fighting gravity all night
but when you touch me like that
when you touch me like that
when you touch me like that
when you touch me like that
when you touch me like
when you touch me like that
cause when you look at me
I slowly fall towards you
I'm fighting gravity all night
I'm pretty sure I'll regret it
but I am letting you take it all
I'm pretty sure I'll regret it
but I am letting you take it all
cause when you look at me
I slowly fall towards you
I'm fighting gravity all night
but when you touch me like that
when you touch me like that
when you touch me like that"
The Ghost,"1,324",Niviro,"I can see you from behind
You can hear me in your mind
Run so fast as you can go
Time will catch you
before you know
Are you afraid of the dark
Are you scared
Hi-hi
You know
I am you
Hi-hi
I'm coming closer
Lalalalalalalala
I will catch you
Hum-hum hum-hum
The time it goes
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

Are you afraid of the dark
Are you scared

You know
I am you

Red Light (Feat. Arielle),"2,944",Cavego,"Fast lights, stop signs
I only see you through my headlights
You're just a midnight shadow, black and white
You only got me at a

Only got me at a red, red light
You only got me at a red, red light
You only got me at a red, red light
You only got me at a red, red light

Independent, pre divide
If no one else know questions tell no lies
In the shadows, tryna hide
We could pretend that we'll be
Could pretend that we'll be, we'll be alright
We're gonna be, we're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be

You only got me at a red, red light
You only got me at a red, red light
We're gonna be, we're gonna be alright

We're gonna be

[Verse 3]
Ay yo, bring in the blunt, Emily Blunt
Platinum back, ice bling in the front
I'ma land the jump, Yao Ming the dunk
And I'm playing the field, Brad Wing the punt
I'ma tell him I love him in the foreign and cuff him
Whips in immigration, everything on them is custom
Now they calling me Billy, I'm the goat
No Achilles heel since I left Philly
Countin' them millis to billis
Beep beep beep beep, put the hurt on me
Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skirt on me
Rode him to sleep, and then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules, so I swerve on him
Got my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my paradise, silk ribbon my linen
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women

[Chorus]
Baby, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down, luv seh you nuh eye me
Don't know 'cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down, luv seh you nuh eye me
Don't know 'cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
Baby, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down, luv seh you nuh eye me
Don't know 'cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

Look at what a person

You just turn

You tried to use the band aid
but you laid cement
And now I can say it's too late
cause I'm good on friends
I already got enough of them
I already got enough of them
Words
they never cut you to the bone
Does it look good up
there from your broken throne
Now are you gonna
pull another stunt
Pull out your gun
it's all in good fun

Tokyo Nights,"1,977",Digital Farm Animals,"I wanna go where you go
Blowing your smoke
out the window
Float away back to
those Tokyo nights
You keep me up wide awake
We fall asleep on the floor
in old sheets and Champagne
And I wanna fall like snowfall
Just to melt on your pillow
Drift away back to
those Tokyo nights
Where we were so out of place
We fall asleep in my car
To songs that all sound the same
I wanna go where you go
Blowing your smoke
out the window
Drift away back to
those Tokyo nights
You keep me up wide awake
We fall asleep in my car
To songs that all sound the same
And it really don't matter
which way we go
You got effect like domino
Finally up and down we go
How we get back there
I don't know
And it really don't matter
how fast we go
You got effect like domino
You take me down down
I wanna go
Back to those Tokyo nights
Those Tokyo nights I feel it
I wanna fall like we fell
For the first time in the hotel
Miss the way we fell asleep
in our clothes
But you were to shy to stay
Walking you home it still feels
like it was just yesterday
And it really don't matter
which way we go
You got effect like domino
Finally up and down we go
How we get back there
I don't know
And it really don't matter
how fast we go
You got effect like domino
You take me down down
I wanna go
Back to those Tokyo nights
Those Tokyo nights I feel it
Back to those Tokyo nights
Those Tokyo nights I feel it
I wanna go where you go
Blowing your smoke
out the window
Drift away
And I wanna fall like snow fall
Just to melt on your pillow
Drift away
back to those Tokyo nights
Where we were so out of place
We fall asleep in my car
To songs that all sound the same
I wanna go
Back to those Tokyo nights
Those Tokyo nights I feel it

You and I up all night
Nothing's wrong nothing's right
I swear these walls are upside down
I swear the roof is on the ground
Demons don't sleep at night
Oh, oh, oh

Pre-Chorus
I try to turn off my mind
Say I'm doing just fine
But I'm screaming inside like Oh
Say these words on repeat
While I'm tryin' to breathe
Now you're counting on me

Chorus
So I fake a smile

Verse 2
You were their heavy heart
Tasted light but fed the dark
I'm waiting for them all to see
I don't deserve your company
To love myself is way too hard
Oh, oh, oh

You Feel Like Home,201,Lasso the Sun,"Remember when we used to run
You and I would head
for the evening sun
Remember when we used to talk
A bottle of wine and a plastic fork
And so we built our place to go
Where we’d get old
and our children grow
What it feels like
to share a home
If it weren’t for you
I would never know
Every once in a while
How I wish that we could
share another bottle of that wine
Every once in a while
How I wish that you’d come
over one more time
Oh you feel like
Oh you feel like home
Slowly how I lose control
Wishing waiting for you to show
I’ll meet you there in the afterglow
Your head full of dreams
and your heart of gold
We break a fence
jump over rocks
Find ourselves on the back
of a pick-up truck
You whisper where do we go
As long as you’re with me
I don’t need to know
Every once in a while
How I wish that we could
share another bottle of that wine
Every once in a while
How I wish that you’d come
over one more time
Oh you feel like
Every once in a while
How I wish that we could
share another bottle of that wine
Every once in a while
How I wish that you’d come
over one more time"
Oasis,301,Giiants,"A mirage caught in the desert
Said I don’t need you
that I’m better

Your staring right at me

In the blistering sun
I see you’re the one
I wanna run straight to
I mean it I mean it I mean it
Can’t you
See it see it see it

Would you lean in give me cover
I swear I don’t mean
to pressure you
Making you say things
You don’t really mean
That’s not what I’m after
‘Cause I mean it
I mean it I mean it
Can’t you
See it see it see it

Wanna turn you on (wanna turn you on)

Savor it 'cause baby, when you blink it's over
I'm thick like zinc, I'm sick like smokers
Do you want me or are you just gonna fuck me over?
This is confusional, tell me
Love, is this mutual?
Do you, do you think I'm beautiful?
Or is it business as usual?
Like, are my texts mutable?
Got me smilin' like a fucker at funeral

Think Of Us,113,The Chainsmokers,"I've been thinking more about you lately
All the memories are driving me crazy
Although, I know I don't want your body
But I heard from a friend of a friend
Life is moving on without me
Even calling other lovers your baby
I knew that you would eventually
But it still feels strange
As I drift away
And you kiss her lips like that
Am I on your brain?
Is always a part of me part of you now, baby
I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?

Riding around my neighbourhood
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?
I know
Everything that we wanted, we'd outgrown
But still I don't
Don't like knowing that you're not on your own
Can someone tell my ego
'Cause she won't let me let it go?
She's obsessing and guessing answers
to things she'll never know
As I drift away
And you touch her hips like that, yeah
Am I on your brain?
Is always a part of me part of you now, baby
I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?

High Voltage (with JT Foley),32,Slander,"You know just what to say
To pull me right in and then you ruin my day
And I know where to get in your head
'Cause you like to make you wish we never met

You are the light in an abandoned building
In the middle of a blackout
Swear with time it's gonna hold me different
We always burn it to the ground

Are we too high voltage
To ever fall in love
I could see this working
But it never does
Ending in destruction
We always mess it up
Even though we try and try and try
Are we too high voltage
You and I

Are we too high voltage
You and I

You and I, you and I
Are we too high voltage

Here I go falling in love
Head over heels with the potential of us
And there you go holding me back
You know I'd drop everything if you ever ask

You are the light in an abandoned building
In the middle of a blackout
Swear with time it's gonna hold me different
We always burn it to the ground

Are we too high voltage
To ever fall in love
I could see this working
But it never does
Ending in destruction
We always mess it up
Even though we try and try and try
Are we too high voltage

Little Bit Of Feel Good (Feat. Adam Joseph),"7,136",Something A La Mode,"Just the sound of your voice
Drowning out all my noise
When you call my name mysteriously
All the source to let me see

Little bit of feel good goes a long way
I need your touch to get me through my day
Watching you sleeping I pray
Please don't make my feel good go away

Just a look of those eyes, cutting through my smokey skies
And the parts of me that grow from you
Cleared my vision so that I could see

Little bit of feel good goes a long way
I need your touch to get me through my day
Watching you sleeping I pray
Please don't make my feel good go away

Just the smell of you hair follows me everywhere
Your sweet alchemy turned trouble to gold
Transforming it all to let me know

A little bit of feel good goes a long way
I need your touch to get me through my day
Watching you sleeping I pray
Please don't make my feel good go away

Little bit of feel good goes a long way
I need your touch to get me through my day

I pray to God

I pray to God

Ooh I lost the feeling but I'm tryna hold on
I thought the end of love
is what made you strong
I pray to God
I just don't know anymore
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I won't throw everything from the life way back then
I've been laying on the floor
sweeping on the ground
I would give up everything in life
if I'd know how
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands on
I look up into the sky
I'd give it I'd give it I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you
Ooh when the moon was
shinning bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinning bright to coming rewrite back home
The lights in my eyes they disappeared
A vision in my mind about to keep me from feel
I won't let it hold me down
the other way around
I don't want the words to I can't make a sound
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands on
I look up into the sky
I'd give it I'd give it I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you
Can't hold back reaching out

Between us I told you that

All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
Soundtrack in the wind
Like passing violins
I can be your rhythm
in the silence
And every time we sing
an echo's in the sky
Let me close your eyes
Help you fantasize
Make a kiss our playlist
the entire night
Listen to the words
and a letter flies
Imagine it anywhere
More than miles
I'll take you there
Know one day from the sky
we'll be as one
Now here we are
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
Listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
Listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen

What I Did For Love (Feat. Emeli Sande) (VINAI Remix),"2,240",David Guetta,"What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up then I do it again

It hurts that I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love

Pray To God (Calvin Harris Vs Mike Pickering Hacienda Remix) (Feat. HAIM),"1,626",Calvin Harris,"Oh I remember
when this road was my own
I pray to god
I just don't know anymore
I pray to god
I just don't know anymore
Anymore
I lost the feeling
but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love
and what made you strong
I pray to god
I just don't know anymore
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down anything
in life I know now
I've been lying on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything
in life I know how
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you
Oh when the moon
was shining bright before morning
I made a deal
with the stars to keep holding
Shining bright to come
and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes
they disappeared
The visions in my mind
are enough to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to
I can't make a sound
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you
Hot hot hot I was living in
the heat in the moment
Hot hot hot I was living in
the heat in the moment
Hot hot I was living in
the heat in the moment
Hot hot I was living in
the heat in the moment
Hot hot I was living in
the heat in the moment
Hot hot I was living in
the heat in the moment
Hot hot I was living in
the heat in the moment
Give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you"
Name & Number,"3,521",Shift K3Y,"See this girl from across the room
She's the type to make
you lose your cool
Kinda hard not to recognise
She's with another guy
I can see that she don't even care
If she's not allowed

A love like this is underground
tell me do you hear me

On my body
so that I won't forget ya
Blinding lights fill your eyes
I won't think twice
I want you like no other
Lady leave your name and number

Blinding lights fill your eyes
I won't think twice
I want you like no other
It's impossible to hide us
Even thought he
bought you diamonds
Just say the word
and I'll come to rescue you
Cause he just wants
to keep you silent
You need to know that I've been told
The things he does
when you're not around
And I believe that you
just need some time
To fool around
Lady leave your name and number

I want you like no other
Lady leave your name and number
On my body

Blinding lights fill your eyes
I won't think twice
I want you like no other
I don't want you to be alone at night
I don't wanna see him make you cry
All I want is a simple thing
To remember you by
And baby you know
whenever you're low
That you can call on me
So you give me yours
And I'll give you mine

On my body
so that I won't forget ya

We use to be strangers
Have some lips turn into ravens
My ex-girl is angry
She showered me nameless
And my team is intact
We smoke good and try to relax

Don't turn the music down
I'm looking around
I'm floating with all these clouds
Pashing around
Don't turn the music down

Things In Life,752,Dennis Brown,"[Verse 1]
It's not everyday we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times too
So, have a little faith in what you do ('Cause)

[Chorus]
You don't seem to realize
The things you've got to face in life
Today you're up, tomorrow you're down (So)
Thank God that you're still around town (Wo-ho, my brothers)

[Verse 2]
Though we've got to work like slaves
Just to eat a piece of bread
But, as we go along each day we'll find
Happiness to sooth the mind ('Cause)

[Chorus]
It's not everyday we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times too
So, have a little faith in what you do (Oh, yeah)

Can you get me? (Yeah)
I want you to understand (Ye-yeah)

Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go

Take it all and fuck the rest
Oh get your shit together
Cheer up smoke a cigarette
Oh you know this feeling
When the world stops turning
Focus on the the bright side
Life can make you bitter
But you'll wake up stronger
So focus on the bright side
Lost forever out of sight
Forget the sadness of your nights
Breath deeper than ever
Stand up take another chance
You've gotta keep on fighting
You wanna bring this on
Oh you won't surrender
We'll get through this together
Oh keep shining on the inside
Tell me what's on your mind
You know this feeling
When the world stops turning
Focus on the the bright side
Life can make you bitter
But you'll wake up stronger
So focus on the bright side
You won't surrender
We'll get through this together
Keep shining on the inside

Never Felt A Love Like This (feat. Dotan),873,Galantis,"I was lost in a love
that was built to lose
And all and all all the nights

like this yeah
All I all I know

And it’s keeping me awake
I haven’t slept for days
All I all I know

Say goodbye to the past

feel the start of a rush

Leave it all behind

these rough waters
And your hair's still wet
Come on in from the cold

So many times to start over
So many ways to begin

Hold my word

Show me all your pretty

Titanic,834,Cosmo's Midnight,"Saw you on the weekend
Hanging with a new friend
It caught me in my feelings
Thought you'd be the one damn
That was kinda dumb
Every single word you said
Still messing with my head
Don't want to figure you out
Waste my time fill me with doubt
You said we'd be okay
You'll be Rose
and I'll be your Leo
Reaching out but you're letting go
You said we'd be okay
But I don't feel that way
You said we'd be okay
I don't feel that way
You said we'd be okay
But I don't feel that way
Thought this was forever
Like we were chained together
Wishing we could start it over
Then we could take it slow
I guess you're not the one damn
That was kinda dumb
Every single word you said
Still messing with my head
Don't want to figure you out
Waste my time fill me with doubt
You said we'd be okay

Waiting For You (Feat. NEVRMIND),136,Marc Benjamin,"Do you remember how it felt
To fall in planning our whole lives?
Cause lately I've been thinking bout
How all this fell before our eyes
Cause now the silence is killing me
I'm so tired of feeling
Like I can't do nothing right
I'm so tired of listening
All our friends keep on telling me
That everything'll be alright
We're going down without a sign in sight
That we're gonna make it through
My momma said gotta give time to time
But I'm over just waiting for you
I'll spend my whole life fighting for this
If you tell me that's what you wanna do
But I can't take another of moment of it
Just sitting here waiting for you
Done waiting
Been patient
So long i'm tired of faking
Acting like i'm something to you
So all
I'll say is
Just say it
Tell me just what i'm facing
Baby girl just tell me the truth
Cause now the silence is killing me
I'm so tired of feeling
Like I can't do nothing right
I'm so tired of listening
All our friends keep on telling me
That everything'll be alright
We're going down without a sign in sight
That we're gonna make it through
My momma said gotta give time to time
But I'm over just waiting for you
I'll spend my whole life fighting for this
If you tell me that's what you wanna do

World We Used To Know,584,Alan Walker,"[Verse 1]
Wild, wild, wild horses tell me, where did they all go?
They used to run, used to run, used to run right here
And all I see is an empty road
Wild, wild, wild roses tell me, where did they all go?
When I was young, I was young, they would spread like fire
And now the roots don't know where to grow

[Chorus]
Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It’s out of our hands and it's out of control
I don't think that this is the world we used to know
Is the world we used to know

[Verse 2]
Wide, wide, wide oceans tell me, where do you lead?
When the sun and the sky come to meet at night
I wonder, would you carry me?
Why won’t you tell me if I'm on my own
You used to be, used to be, used to be right here
And now I don't know where to go

[Chorus]
Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It's out of our hands and it's out of control
I don't think that this is the world we used to know
Is the world we used to know

[Bridge]
I could show you places that we had
In the world we used to know
Take me home and show me love can last
There's a world we used to know

[Chorus]
Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It's out of our hands and it’s out of control
I don’t think that this is the world we used to know
Is the world we used to know"

Burning Bridges (feat. Sam Day),73,Swizznife,"Baby I don’t wanna waste my time
But when I’m with you
I don’t really mind it
I was never good at saying goodbye
So we pretend like
there’s nothing to lose
it’s such a pretty lie
It’s you
Who can chase the blues away
What do I do
When we go our separate ways
I don’t know if it’s right
guess I’m still waiting to see
I’m burning all my bridges
I don’t know what it means
I’m not gonna lie
it’s kinda stupid I see
To stay when I know
when it’s already over for me
Babe I haven’t felt this
in a while
I’m up at 2 am
feels like I’m flying
Just waiting for the shoe
to drop, oh why
Do I keep coming back to you
I know we’ve blurred the lines
It’s you
Who can chase the blues away
What do I do
When we go our separate ways
I don’t know if it’s right
guess I’m still waiting to see
I’m burning all my bridges
I don’t know what it means
I’m not gonna lie
it’s kinda stupid I see

Loves The Jobs You Hate,"8,794",HONNE,"So here we are
Head to head
Its been that way
Since I don't know when
You kid yourself
By telling me you are who you are
You are who you are
I'm sorry mate
You're not my date
You wish you were
You wished it bad
You come in here
spouting i'm all that you are
who you are
You are who you are
Said you'd never go away
You've got these troubles
day after day
It it all sounds the same
I'm not listening to
a word you say
Thanks for that
that second chance
But let me tell you something
you'd understand
Go fuck yourself
Don't tell me that you are who you are
You are who you are
It's only been a minute
since you knocked me
Now you're try to treat me
like you love me
But I'm not fooled by it
'Cause you are who you are
You are who you are
Said you'd never go away
You've got these troubles
day after day
It It all sounds the same
I'm not listening to a word you say
You're forever takin' aim
You've got these troubles
day after day
My patience wears away
I'm not listening to a word you say
I've turned down 'cause I'm tired of
You telling me what I should've done
Can it come babe and at this rate
Every word you say drives me away
Said you'd never go away

I'm not listening to a word you say"
City Lights,"2,205",Avicii,"City lights take me away
Now it's time
we never ever head down
Don't be scared
I am for real
Hide away
and we will never be found
It's alright we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright with memories inside
Midnight passed on the floor
Watch it turn into gold
And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm the truth in the sky
so I'm in love with your light
Set me free and settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No I don't know what to feel
Cities lights we're getting away
Heads won't find us
we're not making a sound
We're not scared we are for real
Y'all can't turn us
now we're shutted by lights
It's alright we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright with memories inside
Midnight passed on the floor
Watch it turn into gold
And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel

Footprints,694,Bag Raiders,"These days
I'm stuck inside my head
I can't sleep
I lay awake in bed
And when I try to work it out
There's something in my way
But there's no bush to beat around
No changing yesterday
So let me take just a minute
To find the time to let you know
I got your footprints burning
through my mind
It feels like the more that I resist
The tighter it grips
And you leave me
helpless all the time
It's breaking me up
The deeper we touch
You say
I'm not right for you
It can't help
To treat me like you do
And though you
tried to break me down
And bring me to my knees
I won't be stuck here waiting 'round
Cause that's no good for me
So let me take just a minute
To find the time to let you know
I got your footprints burning
through my mind
It feels like the more that I resist
The tighter it grips
And you leave me
helpless all the time
It's breaking me up
The deeper we touch
So let me take just a minute
So let me take just a minute
So let me take just a minute
I got your footprints burning

It feels like the more that I resist
The tighter it grips
And you leave me

through my mind
It feels like the more that I resist

Nothing Like This,"3,214",Blonde,"Oh yeah yeah
We started out being friends
I had my girl
and you had him
Who would have known
we were ready then
Cause I'm holding you tight
in the middle of the night
After we just finished love making
We both waited
withered the storm
Could've cheated
but knew that'd be wrong
Even though we came close
Had to get you out of my mind
I've been round a few times
If I slip and committed the crime
More than just a feeling
This is more than just a crush
This ain't some romantic gesture
This right here is called real love
And nothing really matters
As long as there's you and me
there's us
And I'm letting go now
I ain't felt nothing like this
like this
I ain't felt nothing like this

I ain't felt nothing like this
like this
No I ain't felt nothing
quite like this
Nothing matters
when I'm with you
Life is simple
cause girl you're the truth
All along I was here for you
Waiting til the timing was right
You need a dream
that will show you girl
What you've been missing
More than just a feeling
This is more than just a crush
This ain't some romantic gesture
This right here is called real love
And nothing really matters
As long as there's you and me

I ain't felt nothing like this
like this
I ain't felt nothing like this
like this
No I ain't felt nothing quite

All them others were
just a waste of time
Cause nothing can compare to
when I'm with you
Oh baby yeah
Life can be so unpredictable
sometimes
Gotta be ready to read
between the lines too
You feel me
More than just a feeling
This is more than just a crush
This ain't some romantic gesture
This right here is called real love

When We Were Young (feat. Norma Jean Martine),723,Lost Kings,"This isn't real, it's all in my head, I can feel it
I'm imagining we're gonna wake up from this dream
All over, fall back to sleep please

For a second, for a minute can we go?
For a second, for a minute can we go?
For a second, for a minute can we go?
For a second, for a minute can we go?

Can we go back when we were young
And didn't care if we messed up?
We have forever so we got lost in each other
'Cause time wasn't catching, time wasn't catching us
Back when we were young
And didn't care if we messed up
We have forever so we got lost in each other
'Cause time wasn't catching, time wasn't catching us

[Verse 2]
We thought our paper crowns were silver and gold
We thought our arms are feathers and hollow bones
The more I'm learning, the more I don't know
I feel smaller the more I go

For a second, for a minute can we go?
For a second, for a minute can we go?
For a second, for a minute can we go?

Can we go back when we were young
And didn't care if we messed up?
We have forever so we got lost in each other

Back when we were young
And didn't care if we messed up
We have forever so we got lost in each other

Earthquake,597,FKJ,"Human nature plays with nature
But the nature isn't playing
Some want to rebuild a future
I say stop slaying stop slaying
My hotel room is crackling
Buildings are full of souls falling
And families all struggling
Are turning dead from low ceiling

[Chorus: Guillaume Héritier & FKJ]
Maybe I am ready to leave?
I have lived well for a loner
Maybe I am ready to leave?
I have lived well for a loner

[Verse 2: Guillaume Héritier]
My hotel room from the 10th floor
My last dancefloor as I should tell
My all bedroom has no before
And no later no clientele
Facing fate and I can't fake
When death is there your dances end
When days are done all you can take
Is a deep breath and be decent

[Chorus: Guillaume Héritier & FKJ]
Maybe I am ready to leave?
I have lived well for a loner
Maybe I am ready to leave?
I have lived well for a loner

Oh it's tearing me apart
Wishing you were mine

You're out of love

Can't let go
They say time is a healer
All I know

I'm still dreaming of you when I wake up
I'm not ready to lose your heart
All the things that I'd do not to break up
Will they ever be good enough?

Finding out the harder way would be a mistake

So don't you try to save me
It's not worth the fight
You don't wanna know
What keeps me up at night
Don't you try to change me
It's a waste of time

It's empty inside

It's empty inside
Don't reach for my heart

Don't reach for my heart
It's empty inside

Trapped inside this make believe
Wish you knew you're in too deep

Only dark skies on the border
There's no sunshine shining round the corner
It's a dead end in a lost place
Finding out the harder way would be a mistake

So don't you try to save me
It's not worth the fight
You don't wanna know
What keeps me up at night
Don't you try to change me
It's a waste of time
Don't reach for my heart
It's empty inside

Don't reach for my heart
It's empty inside
Don't reach for my heart
It's empty inside"
Strangers,3,Kenya Grace,"It always ends the same
when it was me and you
but every time I meet somebody new
it’s like de ja vu

I swear they sound the same
It’s like they know my skin
every word they say sounds just like him
and it goes like this

we’ll get in ur car and
you’ll lean to kiss me
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night
when everything changes
You won’t reply
and we’ll go back to strangers

Uh huh uh huh

it’s something that I hate
how everyone’s disposable
now every time I date somebody new
I feel vulnerable

that it’ll never change
& it will just stay like this
never ending dating breaking up
and it goes like this

we’ll get in ur car and
you’ll lean to kiss me
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night
when everything changes
You won’t reply
and we’ll go back to strangers

Uh huh uh huh

It always ends the same
when it was me and u
but every time I meet somebody new
it’s like de ja vu

when we spoke for months
did u ever mean it?
how can they say that this is love?
when it goes like this

we’ll get in ur car and
you’ll lean to kiss me
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night
when everything changes
You won’t reply

Poker face



I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas Plays

사람들이 택사스 카우보이 경기를 하는것처럼 그들을 갖고 싶어

Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me (I love it)

나를 안으려면 안고 때릴태면 때리고 그것을 일으켜,그대여 내 곁에 머물러줘(난 그걸 좋아해)

Luck and intuition play the cards with Spades to start

운과 육감 스페이드를 시작으로 카드게임을 해

And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

그가 푹 빠진후 언젠가 난 그의 가슴위에서 놀게될꺼야

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh



I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

내가 가진것을 보여줘, 그를 흥분시킬꺼야

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh,



I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

내가 가진것을 보여줘서, 그를 흥분시킬 꺼야

Can't read my,

날 읽을 수 없어

Can't read my

날 읽을 수 없어

No he can't read my poker face

그는 내 무표정한 얼굴을 읽을 수 없어.

(She's got to love nobody)

(그녀는 아무도 사랑하지 않아)

Can't read my

날 읽을 수 없어

Can't read my

No he can't read my poker face

그는 내 무표정한 얼굴을 읽을 수 없어

(She's got to love nobody)

(그녀는 아무도 사랑하지 않아)

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be

난 그와 견고하게 하나가 되어 구르고 싶어 우린 그렇게 되겠지

A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)

당신과 함께 있을때 작은 도박은 재밌어,

Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun

총이 없는 러시안 룰렛도 지루하지 않아.

And baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun, fun

그대여 사랑을 할때는 거칠지 않다면 재미가 없을꺼야

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh



I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

내가 가진것을 보여줘 그를 흥분시킬꺼야

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh,

(그녀는 아무도 사랑하지 않아)

I won't tell you that I love you

난 당신에게 사랑한다고 말하지 않겠어

Kiss or hug you

키스도 포옹도 하지 않겠어

Cause I'm bluffin with my muffin

난 내가슴에 따라 허세를 부리기 때문이지

I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning

난 자고 있는게 아니야 나의 정욕의 총사냥에 기절한것 뿐이지

Just like a chick in the casino

카지노의 매춘부처럼

Take your bank before I pay you out

당신이 나간사이 돈을 지불하기 전에 당신 돈을 챙겨

I promise this, promise this

내가 이건 약속하지,이건 약속하지

Check this hand cause I'm marvelous

이 손을 조사해 난 교묘하거든

Can't read my,

날 읽을 수 없어

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on to chokers, you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?

But I can't find a girl that lives close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed out on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front
You're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time
I put those pepperonis on your face, made you a creature
Now I think about you
Every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Oh, she killed that shit
She was killing it, that was hard, bruh
I didn't know she could get that high but she killed that

All the things I said
I really wish that I didn't
I wish that I didn't
Through the conversations
we had 'til 4 AM
You said
you want something different

We Were Young,797,Petit Biscuit,"I didn’t wanna open my heart no
I didn’t wanna get too deep
I knew that I’d get lost
in her eyes
So I stared down at my shoelaces
I took her to the car
in the drive
and we stared at the sky
and we laughed 'til we cried
And we got so high
and she stayed all night
We were young and helpless
When I wake in the morning
And I see the light
Pouring from my bedroom window
What a day what a day
what a morning
When I realize
I was cautious but I’m guilty
I’m in love
Love
I wanted you to stay for the day
But you left with a kiss
on my cheek
I couldn’t get my mind
off the way
that you looked
in my Daft Punk T-shirt
I took a little drive in my car
with a smile on my face
and a hope in my heart
Maybe this is the start
of a bon voyage
We were young and helpless
When I wake in the morning
And I see the light
Pouring from my bedroom window
What a day what a day
what a morning
When I realize
I was cautious but I’m guilty
I’m in love
Love
Take me back
Darling won’t you take me back
Take me take me take me back
take me back
Darling won’t you take me back
take me take me
We’ll be Juliet and Romeo
Falling in love like dominoes
Talking all night in stereo
All night all night
We could make love and hide away
We could take off and fly away
Tell me can we go back again
Take me take me take me back
Take me back
Darling won’t you take me back
Take me take me
take me back take me back
Darling won’t you take me back
Take me take me take me
I guess I'm falling helplessly
I can feel it taking over me
I guess I'm falling helplessly"

Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams

Fade Away (feat. INNA),107,Sam Feldt,"Verse 1
Take it slowly
'Cause it feels like time has got something to show me
Through a crowded room, look at me like you know me
Ain't it funny how a second lasts forever
When we're together

Pre-Chorus
And I-I-I might get enough one day
But I-I-I won't let this feeling fade away

Chorus
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay, don't let this feeling fade away

Post-Chorus
Won't let this feeling fade away

Verse 2
Don't you hurry
I will show you all the treasures that I buried
Try to hide but you just always see right through me
Sometimes I feel like giving up but you're the reason
That I'm not leavin'

Chorus
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay, don't let this feeling fade away

Post-Chorus
Won't let this feeling fade away

Chorus
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay, don't let this feeling fade away"

Weight Of A Feeling (feat. Julia Shuren),12,Lupage,"I tried to forget that you were ever mine
But the truth got heavier
with every lie (I told myself)
Oh and driving away
Would never help me escape
Would never help me escape from you
And the thunder and rain
Would never wash out the pain
Would never wash out the pain
Never wash out the pain we drew
And it’s weighing on my back
and shoulders too
What couldn’t be, yeah you and me
Were the weight of a feeling
The weight of a feeling like that
Ou the weight of a feeling
(Woah a feeling)
In the back of my heart
and in the back of my mind
Burning a hole inside
So how do I leave it alone
When the stronger
I get oh the longer I go
What’s the point in cutting ties
If you’re still tied up in my mind
So I’ll go out
Go home
Think about you
Just one more time
And it’s weighing on my back
and shoulders too
What couldn’t be, yeah you and me
Were the weight of a feeling
The weight of a feeling like that
Ouuu the weight of a feeling
Ouuu the weight of a feeling"

We were young
I was dumb
Now you’re happy and you moved on

In my head, I can’t forget
All the stupid shit you said
And it’s not fair
You don’t care
But I see you everywhere
Oh, it’s not fair

You’re polite to friends of mine
You were always the one they liked
I called them up when we were done
I swear they took it as hard as us
And my mom says she saw you
Stood with somebody new
She said, what went wrong with you 2
Well, I wish I knew

In my head, I can’t forget
All the stupid shit you said
And it’s not fair
You don’t care
But I see you everywhere

In my head I can’t forget
All the words you never meant
And it’s not fair
You don’t care
But I see you everywhere
Oh, it’s not fair

So tell me, truly
Do you think about me
Or you happy with some other girl
Tell me, baby
Don’t you kind of miss me
But I hope you picture me
When you’re with her

In my head, I can’t forget
All the stupid shit you said
And it’s not fair
You don’t care
But I see you everywhere
Oh, it’s not fair
Oh, it’s not fair

Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper
and I don't know why
I get jealous but I'm too cool

Looking for signs of life
When you flashed upon my screen
Testing the atmosphere
Your silhouette appears
And I know I'm not alone
But empty haze
Is all that remains
I'm lost on the sidewalk
Just calling your name
I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete
You walked off with someone new anyway
Live via satellite
Checking my vital signs
Because it all feels so unreal
Everything good must end
But we can live again
In the glass simulacra
I can't replace
Your ethereal waves
I sleep on the concrete
And dream of the days
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway

Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name

(Verse)
Didn't I make it harder
Didn't I leave you that
Was it too much to ask you
Why it is you still care

(Chorus)
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name

(Bridge)
Come back, baby at times I'll cut you up and never let go
Sweet love, play your song
Call your mother, say take me home
Like your smile, don't say not
Another man down if you let them know

(Chorus x2)
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name"
Addicted To A Memory (Feat. Bahari),"3,530",Zedd,"We are we are
a violent chemistry
Love has taken us
as far as we can reach
but I can't leave
We are we are
imagine ecstasy
Holding on to
what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Holding on to
what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
A memory
We are we are
in our memories
We are sentimental
slaves on broken knees
We're on empty
We were we were
one identity
Now the trouble is remembering
Addicted to a memory"

Sleepless,810,Chymes,"I felt your hand
On my hand
Now we are at it again
Baby I'm greedy
and this isn’t easy
and we’ve crossed the border
We’ve done it before
You got me so guilty
Sitting in your backseat
I know that I should leave
You know I won’t
Think I’m losing my head
Treading at the deep end
Never let you address
Cuz i’m taking mine off
We’re both lying here
just sleepless
I pretend that I don’t need it
All I wanna do is repeat this
We’re both lying here
just sleepless
Knock at your door 1 am
I know you’ll let me come in
I’m being unfair
I know what I said
Saying that we’re only friends
when we’re not
Got me so guilty
Laying on your bed sheets
I know that I should leave
You know I won’t
Think I’m losing my head
Treading at the deep end
You don’t know where we stand
I’m taking it off
We’re both lying here
just sleepless
I pretend that I don’t need it
All I wanna do is repeat this
We’re both lying here

We’re both lying here

Let Go (feat. Tim Riehm),728,Dazz,"I'm up
In motion
I got two girls that I ghosted cause
I'm tryna get closer to you
No cuffs and
I noticed
There's no man that
you're holding so
Why don't we make the most
of this moment
Cause the night's
just waiting to be used up
And baby
I'm just searching for some
true love
Spent a lifetime looking for it
no luck
But I feel like
I just found the real one
So let go
And I'll follow
Stay close
'Til tomorrow
Yeah let go
And I'll follow
Girl move your body closer
We'll lift each other up and
Let go
So let go
Stay close
Yeah let go
Girl move your body closer
We'll lift each other up and
Let go
Don't say goodbye
If it feels right gotta let it ride
I'll take you high
Yeah let me hold your hand

Just feel the vibe
Yeah baby we can go all night
baby we can go all night
So don't say goodbye
No don't say goodbye
Cause the night's

What's Love Got to Do with It,946,Kygo,"You must understand
though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
of boy meeting girl

It's physical
Only logical

that it means more than that

got to do with it
What's love
but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do
got to do with it
Who needs a heart
when a heart can be broken
Oh what's love got to do

What's love but a second-hand emo
What's love got to do

Who needs a heart

It may seem to you
that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
you do it for me
Oh what's love got to do
got to do with it
What's love

I get a text but nah I'm not with it
About the best party this city has ever seen
But I'm not trippin', no
Heard every adjective in existence
In their foolish Facebook descriptions
But they ain't foolin' me
Still it's a Friday night
I'm feeling something
Hit up the crew but they already comin'
And if we all ain't even doin' nothin'
Better than doing something with nobodies

Just a house and a bottle
Call me crazy but I'll be with my homies

Last night was so crazy
That's what I always hear from them lately
But you probably paid that dude 80
Just to get in
And I bet you hate me
Didn't have to smile just to say say cheese
I don't gotta buy a drink for these ladies
That don't know my name

Zombie (feat. Valerie Broussard),115,ILLENIUM,"Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, eh-eh
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie? Eh-eh

What's in your-
What's in your-
What's in your-
(Eh-oh)
Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
And the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, eh-eh
What's in your head, in your head

Sleeping In My Own Bed,"1,090",Morly,"Hopped in your sheets a little longer
I'm waiting for the sun
And I feel the breeze
where you would hold me
Only dreams to keep me warm
But there's something in my lungs
that makes me wonder
A question even I don't understand
You ask me where I'll be
without hints there of me
The end of the night
at the end of night
You'll find
I'm sleeping in my own bed
sleeping in my own bed
You'll find
I'm sleeping in my own bed

You'll find
I'm sleeping in my own bed

You'll find
I'm sleeping in my own bed
sleeping in my own bed
And I'd love to be with you in autumn
Like the colors of your soul
But I feel so green my sole reminder
How I loved you paint my own
Oh I heard you in the dark
when I was lonely
A trembling voice
that I could understand
Now you ask me where I'll be
when the sun begins to bleed
The end of the night
at the end of night
You'll find
I'm sleeping in my own bed
sleeping in my own bed
You'll find
I'm sleeping in my own bed

Face To Face,"1,960",Daft Punk,"What's going on
Could this be my understanding
It's not your fault
I was being too demanding
I must admit
it's my pride that made me distant
All because
hoped that you'd be someone different
There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll
find face to face

I turned you away
cause I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget
until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you
in my blank confusion
I realized you weren't wrong
it was a mere illusion
It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get
involved face to face

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved
face to face"

But we act so unaware
It just goes to show
Our love isn't fair
Tomorrow's never promised
Only yesterday's a guarantee
And if I'm being honest yeah baby

I'm unaligned with my body and mind
It's playing tricks, I say I'm fine
But really, it's hurting me deep inside

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been dreaming 'bout you, ooh
I've been wishing that I was next to you, ah
I've been dreaming of us, oh
I've been thinking that this is not a need or a must, but

[Verse 2]
Love has treated me so, so wrong
This year all I've got to show are songs
And I want to be super duper true to you
But God, I don't know what to do
'Cause last year I was just 22
Feels like it up and flew
So far away, and out of view
But 23 seems like me and you

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been dreaming 'bout you, ooh
I've been wishing I was next to you, ooh
I've been dreaming of us, ah
I've been thinking this is not a need or a must, but
(I've been dreamin' of us)

[Bridge]
I know sometimes I make you feel insane
Sorry, that's just how I play this stupid game
I can't act like a child and disobey
All that you want from me and that you say
I'm sorry, baby, please, puppy
I'm trying to be ultra mega happy
And show you my smile, and send you my feelings
And fuck, it is so hard, being so damn far
I guess I'll just stay here and stay singing in my car?
I'll sing in my car

[Chorus]
I've been dreaming 'bout you, ooh
I've been wishing I was next to you, ooh
I've been dreaming of us, oh
I've been thinking this is not a need or a must, but
I've been waiting on you, ooh
I've been waiting for you to tell me those three words too
'Cause I've been hoping it's true, ooh
That one day I'll feel like I am something real for you
(I've been dreamin' of us)
Somethin' real for you, somethin' real for you...
Somethin' real for you, somethin' real for you"
Quit You (Feat. Tinashe) (ToWonder Remix),730,Lost Kings,"Tell me if I'm right
'cause I've been thinking
every time that you reply
that you been drinking
'Cause the only time you think of me is
when the sun is down
Pour another glass and
keep on fuckin' me around
Woken by the window
and I'm reminded that
My thoughts under my pillow
containing memories of the
Places where we could have been
if it were up to me
I guess that all your promises
were just my fantasies
Now I'm addicted
to the high you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken,
oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same
old Coldplay song
And every time you turn it on
God knows I can't fix you
But I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Remind me once again
why I'm repeating
That we can't be more than friends
I'm just protecting myself
from the possibility
that you could turn me down
Thinking that I'm better off
if I don't make a sound
So I'm addicted to the
high you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken,
oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same
old Coldplay song
And every time you turn it on
God knows I can't fix you
But I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I promise, I promise, I promise myself
I won't see you again
Won't answer your calls, no, not at all,
or read any text that you send
I promise, I promise, I promise myself
this will come to an end
'Cause I can't do this again
No, I can't quit you
No, no
no, I can't quit you
I can't quit you"

Right back where we left

stone cold
We're living in a desert of us

Subtle Thing,"3,808",Marian Hill,"It's 2AM and I am trying to sleep
You told me
Lady you were thinking of me
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna live without it
You told me
Lady you were thinking
It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing
I always see you
when I'm out on the street
I wanna talk and you appear
on my screen
Dreaming like a broken record
Looping all you know forever
You told me
Lady you were thinking
It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing
We always play into
I love the way we move
Heard your favorite record
on the day before we met
I love the way we move
Every time I hear it now
I kinda start to swear
We always play
when I feel you getting closer
Are you teasing me
It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing
It's a subtle thing
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing"

16 Steps,"1,118",Martin Jensen,"Lately I feel like I've been selling
Half of my soul to feel your love

Who's body is all that I know
Lately I feel like I've been feeling
Something you don't so help me
Gotta pull you in close but I know
That I should be letting you go
A mess with it a mess without it

from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body

hold me down and
Swallow your prayers
just spit me out
I wanna believe something that's
Different from what I've been told
different from what I've been told
Take all my doubts so I can really
Be with you now and let my body
Really believe in something that's
Different than letting you go
letting you go

Hold You Down,388,Will Grands,"I know our world's have been changing
You shouldn't be suffocated
Why have I been so rude

It's clear what I have been missing
It's us together hugging and kissing
But, babe, we'll make it through
And I'm making time so I'll be seeing you, again

Hold you down this time

Verse 2
Why can't I be the simple guy to you
I'm freaking worried when you buy a couple drinks or two
I'm texting what you're doing every single minute too
I wish you all the best I know that you'll be seeing through this
Yep, I know it's not that good, for our relationship to be as close
It's understood
That I should give you space and let you have a good night too
Because it's horrible to see that I've been hurting you

Why didn't you tell me that I was drowning you
I know I should've seen that you should be alone

Why Do I Try,847,Gill Chang,"The moon always feeds the madness
And its tide always pulls me in
Deeper into this unrest
Futher from where i fit
They told me give change a chance
Instead i'm dancing
with the minute hand
They never told me
it would feel so bad
Don't know much
else i can withstand
So why do i why do i try
It's getting too heavy on
Heavy on my mind
So why do i
The moon only feeds the broken
And i will take all i can get
Cuz empty bodies
only leave me starving
For something deeper than the last
They told me give change a chance
Instead i'm dancing
with the minute hand
They never told me
it would feel so bad
Don't know much

Mixtape (On Repeat),"1,584",Bloome,"In this box I found your letter
Almost twenty pages long
We were bigger than forever
And we thought we knew it all
Now I’m looking at the picture
Of you dancing in the sun

Where you wrote your number on
On these lonely nights
Going back in time
playin’ your mixtape
Turn it up for one last time eeh oh
It’s these lonely nights
Rolling down the memory lane
It made me turn it up
for one last time
And listen on repeat
And listen on repeat
How you told me not to panic
When we stole your father’s car
And we drove up to the mountains
To set a fire in the dark
Now your words they feel like magic
They remind me how it was
Do you ever think about me
I’ve been wondering where you are
On these lonely nights
Going back in time
playin’ your mixtape
Turn it up for one last time eeh oh
It’s these lonely nights
Rolling down the memory lane
It made me turn it up

Jealous (I Ain't With It),"3,067",Chromeo,"I get strung up from her loving
I wish she'd care to see
But she only cares when she's got the time
And I fret so much about her loving
I wish she'd let me be
But our destinies got us intertwined
And is it really my fault?
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys
Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
What is she thinking? Too much uncertainty
Why can't she give some sort of sign?
You know and I know, a thing about loyalty
Ooh, but that girl don't pay it no mind
So is it really my fault?
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys
Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it

I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I get strung up from her loving
I wish she cared to see
But she only cares when she so inclined
And I fret so much about her loving
I wish she'd let me be
But our destinies got us so intertwined
Back in 2011, I decided
To not let this play with my mind
But when the boys from out of town
They come back around
I feel like committing a crime, yeah
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it"

Sometimes, I feel I overshadow you
So I make myself small, you didn't ask me to
But if I unleash the beast
You'll be runnin' from me
So I just let it be, yeah

Pre-Chorus
Don't wanna fight you truthfully
Makin' it harder than it has to be
It feels like you comin' after me, yeah
Now it's clear like night and day
That it's not safe in my hideaway
I think it's time for me to break out

Chorus
If you can turn my dust to gold
Take me there, I'm sold
I'll put all my money down
Take a risk and lose it all
Turn my dust to gold, baby
Come and rock my world
I'll put all my money on it

Verse 2
I'm finding it hard to misbehave
If I lеt my guard down, I'm diggin' my own grave
I can't afford no more mistakes

pretty in a hotel bar
So baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just
why I left you I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson okay

Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years no call

Have It All,"1,799",Elephante,"Pressure on the clay
Carving out opinions
Whisper that I'm winning
Force it every day
Hide away from nothing
Screaming out for something
Don't know how to fool you no more
Miss the point in the clear view
I'm shy
Maybe we should argue
until we find a meaning
Back to the beginning back to before
But you can have it all
You can have it all
But you can have it all
Did my best to stay
Under your affection
Cursing my reflection
I know winds are gonna change
And you bury your engine
Every single day
I don't know how to fool you no more
Miss the point in the clear view
I'm shy
Maybe we should argue
until we find a meaning
Back to the beginning back to before

gonna do me right

Make it so the fire doesn't stop
Are you listening to me
Don't tell me that I might

Tell me that I might

Tell me that I might

Let my body do me right

I'm still coming into my own
You can't keep falling into my arms

When it's time to do what I do
It's all I need from you
Say are you listening to me
Don't tell me that I might

Drag My Heart,106,Vice,"Something in the way she moves I'm losing control
I keep hanging on it
Keep on hanging on it
Testing all my limits I'm about to explode
I keep waiting on it
Keep on waiting on it
All these innuendos
You're sending pictures no clothes
And still no one gotta know
Cause we don't tell them
But like that tat on your side
I guess I'm something you hide
And I just can't let it slide

Don't go dragging my heart around
If you wanna love me love me now
Don't keep dragging my heart around
If you wanna love me love me now

(End)
Baby don't go dragging my heart, my heart around
Baby don't go dragging my heart around"

Do I live in a nightmare?
Crowds are moving nowhere
Blinded by the cyberspace
Heart tight shut to all mistakes
Where have you been when I was in school?
Did you missed it? Did you missed the class?
You said I played it like a fool
You kept it quiet, quiet when I pass

Yet you'll never show yourself as a window of worlds
You have trapped yourself in a web of lies
It will be your guise (Thats shit got me goin~)

I could take your car name a place n we'll go
Park it on a rooftop no one else gotta know
Pull up by the shops get some liquor to go
We ain't posing for the gram yea 'cause this ain't for show
Staring at the stars soju bottle sipping
Got me thinkin' far when the rain got us both drippin'
Till it hit me hard we were both grippin'
By the hands so it started slipping out of my mouth
I said I love you baby sure
Yea the silence got me shook (Hold up!)
Maybe we should go slower (Really?)
Got me freakin' out feelin' all sober (Choker)
As I feel the breeze~~~~~~
My mind starts to ease
She gave me a kiss and the keys ain't a guarantee
But I got tomorrow we'll see

Yet you'll never show yourself as a window of worlds

make me feel like I'm flawless
And you make me
make me feel like
I'm perfect with you
How do you make me
make me seem like I'm flawless
And everything's alright with me
When everything
about me is far from perfect
I'm always up at 4
I know I got a reputation
But you heard it all before
You don't need no
explanation yeah

make me feel like I'm flawless

Don't Need Your Love,34,Shiftbach,"It’s almost like I missed you
But I could
Never let myself forget
All my love you misused
So I won’t play your games
And all the times I feel something
There’s a voice in the back of my head
Telling me to keep running
Cause all that you are is regret, no
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your touch
I don’t need anything, anything now
You gave up on us
Now your time is up
I don’t need anything, anything now
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your love
Love, love, love, love
Speaking to the mirror
To listen
To someone who is making sense
It’s never getting clearer
Can’t cut you out the frame
And all the times I feel something
There’s a voice in the back of my head
Telling me to keep running
Cause all that you are is regret, no
I don’t need your love
I don’t need your touch
I don’t need anything, anything now
You gave up on us
Now your time is up
I don’t need anything, anything now
I don’t need your love

Little Bit Yours,82,Galantis,"Oohhhhh
Oohhhhh

Oohhhhh

And tonight i’m a little bit yours

I'm trying to be honest
With the way I'm feeling now
And maybe I get lonely, lonely
When the sun is going down

I'll love you in the night, night
But I might not stay around

I'm a little bit wild
A little bit shy
A little bit low
Even when I get high
A little uncertain
Still you want more
And tonight I'm a little bit yours

I'm a little bit here
A little bit gone
A little bit found right
Where I belong
What's coming tomorrow
We'll never be sure
But tonight I'm a little bit yours

I'm trying trying

Da da da da da da dum

And tonight i’m a little bit yours

Mirrors,37,Caravan Palace,"All eyes on you
When you go downtown
One foot on the ground
It’s all over the news

But i’m confused
When the stage is mine
I remain
Invisible to all

All eyes on you
When you think out loud
Hackneyed line
All people let loose

But i’m confused
If I call it out
They shut me down
No matter what I get screwed

You bother me
You’re ahead of me
(It’s) all due to nothing but jealousy
You’re blame-free
Steppin up for me
And beyond the magic, you’re buggin’ me
You bother me
You’re ahead of me
How can you be so placid, when you disagree
You’re fault-free
Steppin up for me
I'm the hero sidekick
C'est la vie

All eyes on you
When you dress real' tight
Look sharp in the dark
Hell you raise the roof !

But I'm confused
If I wear no tights
Drop that mask
Will they call me stooge

All eyes on you
When you split the crowd
Many fans all around
They’re all over the moon

But I'm confused
I'm the background guy
Lame duck on (the) side
No matter what I get… screwed !

You bother me
You’re ahead of me
(It’s) all due to nothing but jealousy
You’re blame-free
Steppin up for me
And beyond the magic, you’re buggin’ me
You bother me
You’re ahead of me
How can you be so placid, when you disagree
You’re fault-free
Steppin up for me
I'm the hero sidekick

Wish I could go where you are
You shoot across the sky
You make me feel so alive

Oh it’s hard to say
I sound like an
Overused cliché
I just gotta ask
If I see you up there
Would you fly for evermore
Or would you stay here with me with me

You’re like a shooting star

Catch a ride on the moon
And take a walk on the sun
I hope you‘ll come back soon
Because i miss you a ton

Oh it’s hard to say

Overused cliché
I just gotta ask
If I see you up there
Would you fly for evermore

WORTH NOTHING (Fast & Furious: Drift Tape/Phonk Vol 1) (Feat. Oliver Tree),50,TWISTED,"Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care
If you really don't like me?
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me
like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I nеver wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen ovеr and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again
You say you don't want me
You call me good for nothin'
Straight to my face
You say you don't need me
You call me good for nothin'
A waste of space
I watch the walls cavin' in on me
I'm sick of feelin' so fuckin' lonely
By now I've given up all hope
I guess I'm better off alone
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me
like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again

Collapse,47,Neffex,"Till I collapse

[Verse 1]
Till I collapse
I'll be moving too fast
Got my foot up on the gas
Full throttle 'till I crash
I'm back
With a vengeance
You gon see me end this
I will be ascending
I don't ever slack
I got my eyes on a prize
What I see for my life
I don't float, no I fly
Do or die
'Cause you gotta do or die
There ain't no compromise
Get ready for a fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you wanna see what you're made of?
What if there was no one to save us?
Would you leave it all on the pavement?
Would you dye the ground with some stray blood?
I just wanna find out my limits
I'mma put everything in it
I'm in this lifе to win it
And this is just the beginning...

[Chorus]
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?

[Bridge]
I'll fight till I collapse
I'll fight till I collapsе
I'll fight till I collapse

[Verse 2]
My energy is unmatched
I don't get tired, no I don't get gassed
I'm back
Still working to surpass
Everybody getting passed on my way up fast
No slack
So watch out for me now
Everybody in this town will be looking at my crown
I'll attack
I got my knuckles all wrapped
Blood drips from the scabs
Bloody fists from the jabs

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you wanna see what you're made of?
What if there was no one to save us?
Would you leave it all on the pavement?
Would you dye the ground with some stray blood?
I just wanna find out my limits
I'mma put everything in it
I'm in this life to win it
And this is just the beginning...

Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
I'll fight till I collapse
I'll fight till I collapse"
Turn Your Phone Off,89,PinkPantheress,"was it something i said to your face
when i was stepping one foot out of
your drive that made you throw up that night
you smoked then you did it again
and now these days
i get so sick of the sight of you
not looking alright
alright breathe in ya ya ya ya
there was a time in my life where
i thought that i had maybe made a friend of
time like our stars were aligned
this wasn’t an option at all
so there’s no suprise
that we started to stall
cos we were destined to fall
i turned my phone
but your calls still came through
I don’t know why they do
I don’t even like you
the very next day you
tried again and again
I don’t know why you call me.
When will I see the end?
I turned my phone off but your calls still come through.
I reply when they do cause I want to chat to you
then the next day
we’ll try again and again
I’ll pick up when you call me so
we won’t see the end.
was it something i said
was it something i said
to your face
the day we met
this money going to my head
I ditched the love for the bread
And everything that you said
I felt it right when you left me
It was us i remember
how it happened
It was love i could tell
by your actions
When you call me
i never failed to answer
Im pulling up on ya
right where you at
When i'm with you
I aint worried bout nothing
I wish we could go back to how it was
Got me feeling like i'm drowning,
im unconscious Feel like time
freezing every time we touch
Take your time please
baby we aint rushing
You say its over and you think you had enough
But everytime we fight i end it with i love you
you smoked and you did it
again the day you met me
breathe in breathe breathe in breathe out"
Don't You Want Me,222,Human League,"You were working as a
waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out
I shook you up and
turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on
you're got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget it's me
who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too
Don't don't you want me
You know I can't believe it
when you say that
you won't see me
Don't don't you want me
You know I don't believe you
when you say that
you don't need me
It's much too late to find
you think you've
changed your mind
You'd better change it back or
we will both be sorry
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
I was working as a waitress
in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even I knew I'd find a
much better place
Either with or without you
The five years
we have had have been
such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time
I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do
Don't don't you want me
You know I can't believe it
when I hear that
you won't see me
Don't don't you want me
You know I don't believe you
when you say that
you don't need me
It's much too late to find
you think you've
changed your mind
You'd better change it back or
we will both be sorry
Don't you want me baby

Bad Boy,172,Cascada,"Remember the feelings
remember the day
My stone heart was breaking
My love ran away
These moments I knew
I would be someone else
My love turned around and I fell
Be my bad boy be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you
in my life again
Won't you be my bad boy
be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again
You once made this promise
To stay by my side
But after some time you just
pushed me aside
You never thought that a girl
could be strong
Now I'll show you how to go on
Be my bad boy be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you
in my life again
Won't you be my bad boy
be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy

That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again"
Clarity (Feat. Foxes),"3,681",Zedd,"""I dive into frozen waves
where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks 'till it breaks
your glass and I drown in you again
Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity
why are you my clarity
If our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity
why are you my clarity
Walk on through a red parade
and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
and makes us forget
all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave
cause we both know
what we'll choose
If you pulled and I push too deep
then I'll fall right back to you
Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity
why are you my clarity
Why are you my clarity
Why are you my remedy
Why are you my clarity
Why are you my remedy
If our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity
why are you my clarity

That we beat to death
in Tucson okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city
in a broke down car
And four years no call
Now I'm looking pretty
in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer
in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate
back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older"
Higher (Feat. Maty Noyes),"1,110",Lemaitre,"I'm so afraid of dying here alone
One more day
need a feeling that I know
In this space a love that takes
I've lost my way
always been out on my own
'Til you came
oh who gave you the control
That you take the love we made
If you say you'll be my love
don't be a liar
'Cause I been taking low
you take me higher
Ooh higher higher
Higher higher
I can't stop the love we make
You brought me back to life
And now I feel like I'm alive
I can't breathe
when you're by my side
Need the touch loving takes
You make it hurt so but oh I like
I can't stop the love we make
If you say you'll be my love
don't be a liar
'Cause I been taking low
you take me higher
Ooh higher higher
Higher higher
I can't stop the love we make
Can we just feel it all
Make it go so right that it's wrong
We can be somewhere now tonight
Feel the heat flame is hot
boy you can't put the fire out
I can't stop the love we make
If you say you'll be my love
don't be a liar
'Cause I been taking low
you take me higher
Ooh higher higher
Higher higher
I can't stop the love we make"

That you and I be growing old
Had me placing all my bets on

You would always tell me
Your secrets when we drink
Got so close I'd always think that
We were inches from a kiss
But now you kissing strangers
And we barely even speak
I know I can't make you love me
I just really wish you do
Had me placing all my bets on

Mirage,"2,006",Satin Jackets,"Verse 1:
Overthinking every single part about us
Building ideas out of air
Over analyze our flaws and all our angles I can’t get it out of my head

Pre-Chorus:
When we’re good, we’re good Only me and you
And when we’re low, we’re low
And it fucks up the picture
But when we’re good, we’re good

Chorus:
All I wanted was to stay in this illusion
Without knowing we’re imperfect just the way we are
Was it me, was it you, or just someone we could blame instead
‘Cause all I wanted was to stay in this illusion

Verse 2:
All we do is throwing words and empty bottles
We’re the best at fooling hearts
Once I thought of us as more than hopeless lovers It was only a mirage"
Sunglasses,238,Hopium,"You burn so bright I keep my sunglasses on
You burn so bright I keep my sunglasses on

[Verse 1]
I spent all my principles
I was just guarding my ego, guarding my ego
Paying morning after retribution
I got the drugs for free though, I got the drugs for free though

[Pre-Chorus 1]
5am alone and no friends in sight
Bleeding insecurities walking blind
Holding all these feelings inside inside

And I don’t know the meaning of self-control
Nowadays my sanity comes and goes
Running from reality take me home

[Chorus]
I keep my sunglasses on
So you can’t see inside my soul
Although my senses are numb
I still feel that you could save me
Show me where I went wrong

[Post-Chorus]
You burn so bright I keep my sunglasses on
You burn so bright I keep my sunglasses on

[Verse 2]
Be the adrenaline in my blood
Be the first one that I can trust
Now I’m getting desperate
Allow me to be reckless
Let’s get the fuck out of here

[Pre-Chorus 2]
6am and still got no friends in sight
Hide myself away in the faded night
It’s not so beautiful in the morning light

[Chorus]
I keep my sunglasses on
So you can’t see inside my soul
Although my senses are numb
I still feel that you could save me
Show me where I went wrong

[Post-Chorus]
You burn so bright I keep my sunglasses on
You burn so bright I keep my sunglasses on

[Bridge]
I know that you could save me
I know that you could save me
I know that you could save me
You could be the one

Although my senses are numb
I still feel that you could save me
Show me where I went wrong"

About you that I can't forget
But you're breaking down my walls again
Just to set me free

Distant when I'm holding you
Your fingertips are drifting away
Ends up can love how it hurts

Queen (Feat. Quinn XCII),618,ayokay,"[Chorus: ayokay]
'Cause tonight you're no queen
But you still make it seem
Why you always play the lead?
You're too fast, then you're too slow
And the next thing you know
It's no longer your show

[Verse 1: Quinn XCII]
You're always in my face
No evading where you go
Trying so hard to be that girl
That's on everyone's mind
But I can't escape what I know
You're commonly a fake so
Jump over lines to the unknown
You try so hard to be the one
That breaks the breaking news
But can't relax and say the truth

[Pre-Chorus: Quinn XCII]
So I, throw out a life west
But still you won't grab a hold
I don't see you escaping from the undertow

[Chorus: ayokay]
'Cause tonight you're no queen
But you still make it seem
Why you always play the lead?
You're too fast, then you're too slow
And the next thing you know
It's no longer your show

[Verse 2: Quinn XCII]
You always stick around
Even when I wish you'll fade
Trying so hard to be something
That you're never becoming
I don't have it in me to say
Just go and face the great truth
This running water doesn't stop for you
I can't seem to fight the current rushing over us
The simple things you won't discuss

[Pre-Chorus: Quinn XCII]
So I, throw out a life west
But still you won't grab a hold
I don't see you escaping from the undertow

'Cause tonight you're no queen

Why you always play the lead
You're too fast, then you're too slow

I live such a lonely life
I don't like to go outside
Please, please fucking leave me be
No, I don't want dirty hands
I don't want to be mean
But I'm sick of meeting
New people on my scene
Like I'm aggravated, motivated,
never gonna graduate
I'm stimulated, overstated,
I just wanna get sedated
On the contrary,
I just wanna meet a nice girl
Messy, not too sketchy,
keep me tied up in the right world
Segregated, situated,
hangin' on, sophisticated
Liberated, nauseated,
I just want more medication
Individuality and blue light
gives me headaches
Stopped changing for the better,
I'm just changing clothes on weekends
Weather's nice outside
I think I'll close the window blinds
Yah, sleep through my alarm
So that I skip the sunny part
Uh, I'm not one to take a risk
I'll suck your blood, no anemics
Garlic or sticks, I'm vampiric
I just don't like the sun"

Love Me,625,Felix Cartal,"You’re making me nervous
Looking for my car keys
and pain killers
Tropical sweat
and two middle fingers
I know I should’ve ghosted at two
But I waited it out for you
I wish I knew the way things
were between us
I’m packing a bag of bad ideas
Every time I’m thinking of you
I’m tryna stay cool
in the down town weather
Wondering if you think of me ever
You know how to love me better
It’s got me feeling another level
I can’t get you off of my mind
Why do I keep wasting my time
Man you make it easy for me
So why can’t I make you love me
Love me
So why can’t I make you love me
You’re leaving me hanging
So Imma play cool
when you think I wouldn’t
Liquor by the pool
when I know you’re lookin
While I dissect conversations
Maybe there’s something
there for once
I’m trying not to let these
mind games play me
I’m down to be your casual lady
Long as I got you lovin on me
When I’m tryna stay cool
in the down town weather
Wondering if you think of me ever
You know how to love me better
It’s got me feeling another level
I can’t get you off of my mind
Why do I keep wasting my time
Man you make it easy for me
So why can’t I make you love me
Love me
So why can’t I make you love me
Love me
So this could be a cruel summer
Or a real lover tell me
how you want it to go
But I don’t need another issue
Don’t wanna miss you
Love me or just let me go
I can’t get you off of my mind
Why do I keep wasting my time
Man you make it easy for me
So why can’t I make you love me
Love me
I can’t get you off of my mind
Why do I keep wasting my time
Man you make it easy for me
So why can’t I make you love me

Hotel Room,131,Bloom Line,"I’m putting this dress on
Just so I can feel you taking it off
I like the attention
But hate the way my heart
mistakes it for love
Cuz I got a habit
Running headfirst into traffic
Falling heart first into guys
who take a good thing
Make it tragic
And you’re just the type to
Say you like me till I like you
But every time I let myself I lose
So I’m learning,
I’m learning not to love
Someone who
doesn’t want me to
Yeah, I’m learning,
it’s easier to run
If we keep it in a hotel room
Cuz I don’t wanna go
through all the butterflies
Just to watch them die
the day you change your mind
I’m learning,
I’m learning not to love
Someone who doesn’t want me to
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you
I’m picking myself up
Along with all the clothes
I left on your floor
I won’t get to know ya
But at least I won’t be holding
someone else’s
baggage anymore
Cuz I got a habit
Running headfirst into traffic
Falling heart first into guys
who take a good thing
Make it tragic
And you’re just the type to
Say you like me till I like you
But every time I let myself I lose
So I’m learning,
I’m learning not to love

My Heart's Been (feat. JUNG),41,Eve Alai,"One sunny fateful afternoon
you caught my eye
Fast forward to the month of June
best days of my life
I thought this love could be true
the stars aligned
You went ahead and made up your damn mind

And I can't help wonder why
You had me running dry
Just as I crossed the line
My heart’s been left behind
My heart's been left behind
My heart’s been left behind

지금 난 in the city
고속도로 and I’m doin 90
기억에서 나를 지워줘 이해는 바라지도 않을게 no
I won’t forget you tho
믿어줘 my heart is heave too
난 해야했을 걸 했을 뿐 for us two
인생이란 맛이 있으면 쓴것 두 있는거니까 girl what can I do

And I can't help wonder why
You had me running dry
Just as I crossed the line

I've been watching you
Ooh baby
I know you've been
watching me too
You're the type of girl
In demand and loves to dance
to make the boys go insane
If you're the type of girl
Drink in hand and loves the sand
Then baby I'm your man
Let me take you where the sun goes
I can make
your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby we can leave
our shadows behind
Baby
Like animals in the wild
We could play all day and
all night underneath the stars
I'm the type of girl
In demand and loves to dance
to make the boys go insane
And I'm the type of girl
Drink in hand and loves the sand
So baby take me by the hand
Let me take you
where the sun goes
I can make
your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby we can leave
our shadows behind
Leave our shadows behind
Leave our shadows behind
Beep Beep
Beep Beep
Guess who's rollin
in the snowed out Jeep
On fleek
Got an extra seat
if you wanna roll
with me and be free
Ooooooh weee
let the games begin
Turn up volume on ten
What a feeling no ceiling
Hands up hair
blowing in the wind
Two villains on the run
Two kids following the sun
Footprints in the sand
Skipping rocks
Holding hands Knee deep
in the white wash
It's getting late but
we ain't done yet
Til the coast guard take
our postcard by the sunset
Me and You sipping
Malibu with a view
Let me take you
where the sun goes
I can make
your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby we can leave
our shadows behind
Leave our shadows behind
Leave our shadows behind
sun goes
sun goes
sun goes
sun goes
sun goes
I'm gonna take you
where the sun goes

Ten More Days,"1,132",Avicii,"Ten more days under water
And I already know
I'll be fine
Ten more days til it's over
Til the darkness goes
And I see the light
I'm torn between fulfilling
my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love
that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
and of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days til I'm awake
Ten more days til I don't have to fight
I don't need a future king
There ain't a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and
I'm gonna make it right
You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I'm strong enough
To take the tides
The bed it trembles beneath me
But wherever the road is rough
You know I'll rise
I'm torn between fulfilling
my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love
that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
and of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days til I'm awake
Ten more days til I don't have to fight
I don't need a future king
There ain't a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and
I'm gonna make it right"

It's better that we let it go
A shame that we had
to go our separate ways
If only we could speed time
to another lifetime

With their tanks, and their bombs

How am I ever gonna get through
'Cause I had my chance

And now's my only time to tell you
If the heavens crumbled down
And the days we have are through

didn't know my luck

When I got lost you came unstuck
And drifted off of my horizon
So take me back to where we began

If there’s one last shot
I'll give you all I've got

In Return,804,Breakbot,"Sometimes the road can be so long
But on the way you know you'll find me
Sometimes the road can be so winding
But on the road is where we, both belong
When waters around us get so deep
Though we may sail, we feel we're drowning
When the hills ahead of me get so steep
Cause we will climb another mountain

Chorus
Woahhh~
Give me the strength to carry on
Teach me the things I need to learn
Take me to the places we must go
I'll give you anything in return

Give me the strength to carry on
Give me fire so I can burn
Tell me the tales I need to know
I'll give you anything in return In return, In return
Anything in return In return, In return

Verse 2
You're already here
But I can't see you
You are so near
Under the skin, I can feel you
When fall is around us fall asleep
I'll stay awake until your dreaming
And when years from now, your where you seek
It'll break my heart to see you leaving

Chorus
Woahhh~
Give him the strength to carry on
Teach him the things he needs to learn
Take him to the places he must go
I'll give you anything in return

Give him the strength to carry on
Give him fire so he can burn
Tell him the tales he needs to know
I'll give you anything in return In return, In return

Saw the dark side of the moon

Took too much to ease the anger

You saved that love for someone
For something for somewhere

And you're too tired to break the ties
Hands behind my back
And you're too tired to cut the slack
You say that I'm a mess

You’re rushing way too late
Left your things in the hallway
It strikes me
how nothing has changed
And maybe it’s
cause we don’t want it
Maybe we are better of this way
It’s just how it is
We don’t talk
We don’t talk no
Just get lost in the feeling
And we hide what we have
Leave it all alone

그건 운명일까?
그게 쉽지 않다면, 운명이 아니겠지.
어린 나이에는
내 발밑의 꽃을 소중히 여겼던 나인데,
내 안의 뭔가가 달라졌나봐.
너무 가볍게 느껴지던 나였는데.
이제 제대로 해볼게
나는 단지 시간을 원할뿐.

Wait again,
I will be much better then

Shouldn’t it come to you naturally?
And everyone knows:
You’re losing your gift, and it’s plain to see
But then something must have changed in me,
I don’t fear it anymore
Now I’m sure
I’m sure

이제는 완성돼가?
너라면 쉽게 해낼 수 있는거 아니야?
모두 알고 있어,
네가 너의 재능을 잃어가고 있는게 뻔히 보여.
하지만 내 안의 뭔가가 달라진게 틀림없어,
더 이상 두렵지 않아.
이젠 확실해,
확실해졌어.

Love Like How We Used To,34,픽셀 (FIXL),"Step one you made my best mistake
Stuck in my ways, I take the blame now
With every day, no time to waste
The scars you made were on the way out
You got a hold on me
and everything you said you wanted
You got the best of me
any time don’t you know it
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love
wanna love like how we used to
I wanna know wanna know wanna know
When we lost ourselves
How we got
So close, but now we’re so far
You live in my head
Stain on my heart
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love
wanna love like how we used to
How we used to Love
I wonder why, you ever lied
We always tried to feel so effortless
You hid the fights, said you never cried
Then you rub your eyes
and put the blame on yourself
You got a hold on me
and everything you said you wanted
You got the best of me
any time don’t you know it
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love

Out of my hometown
I could show you round
Cos I’m still proud of where I start

My life’s in my hands,
I’ve only got one plan
Just me and my guitar

Pack up my dreams and go

Tell me that you're here
I'm waiting for you
I won't disappear
I'm falling in and out of love
I'm waiting for you
I won't go I won't stay
I won't take all the memories
I won't leave any behind
I won't push I won't pull
Broken love but it's beautiful
Out of rhythm out of time
A steady beat goes 1 2 3 4
A steady heart goes
I love you more

I know sometimes it's confusing

Yeah I guess I'm an asshole
get ass in these cities
See rap that's the benefit
I came to your city
you fell in love with me
I smashed for the hell of it
My new chick is everything
your envy is evident
I do not have time
to talk 'bout my past
and all your stories
embellishments
I'll give you an hour or two
the best of your life
you can relish in
Running around talking
'bout these accomplishments
Things that you never did
penthouse the president
Met Mike
it's been history ever since
My writer is whiskey and M&M's
I just popped a pill
I feel limitless
A steady beat goes 1 2 3 4
A steady heart goes

I know sometimes it's confusing
A steady beat goes 1 2 3 4
A steady heart goes

I know sometimes it's confusing

Ivory (Feat. Patawawa),"1,960",Tez Cadey,"Sun's off
She won't budge
Down the jungle on her knees
We'll go
To where we know
Tame the wine drops, stumble down the hills
You got to close your eyes and let them fly, you got to
Drink your tears and sing your fears
Listen to the rumble over rain
And as the flames burned down
We ran ourselves to hide
And heard the words they cried
He e ey
Don't you run don't you move until they see
He e ey
We're made of dust and ivory
Sun's off
A child asleep
Swings the ashes to the sea
Will they
Remember me
As the creatures live on peacefully
You got to close your eyes and let them fly， you got to
Drink your tears and sing your fears
Listen to the rumble over pain
And as the flames burned down
We looked the otherside
And heard the way they lied
He e ey
Don't you run don't you move until they see
He e ey
We're made of dust and ivory
He e ey
Don't you run don't you move until they see
He e ey
We're made of dust and ivory"

I know I'm being lied to
I just need some time to
Stop thinkin' about you

Sticks and stones

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away fire away
Ricochet you take your aim
Fire away fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

Paradise (Radio Edit.),811,Chris Brown,"I'm here at the end, yeah, if I could go back to the start

Remember the heat, yeah, that's keeping you warm?

Saying brighter, now we're burning up, light up
Yelling turn it up, let go, let go, let go
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
In paradise, the closer I get to you it feels like paradise
And I'd do anything you'd want me to when we're in paradise
I'll see you on the other side, where it's alright
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise

You better be ready cause all good things come to an end
Spring into summer, my fire's burning again

Saying brighter, I'm not giving up, light up
Gonna live it up, let go, let go, let go

In paradise, the closer I get to you it feels like paradise
And I'd do anything you'd want me to when we're in paradise
I'll see you on the other side, where it's alright
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise, paradise
If tonight is the last night, I'll see you in paradise, paradise, paradise

Help you lose control

He'd see how far
you've passed him

Hometown Girl,"1,921",ZHU,"You'll never be my hometown girl

I'm tired of the get around girls
Ain't nothing like my hometown girl

You told me you were cool with kickin' it
In my crib, in my pool, we be dippin' in
But some days you would look at me so different
Ooh, why
Is it because I'm in the music biz
Or you don't wanna love me when I'm just strugglin'
But you still tell me that you're my hometown chick, why

I'm missing someone else
This will never be the same
But I blame it on myself
Because I can't make you change

You'll never be my hometown girl
There's nothing like her in this world
I'm tired of the get around girls
Ain't nothing like my hometown girl

I can't remember when we last expressed
All the feelings in our hearts that we possess
Even though we're making love, it's not passionate
Ooh, why
You keep on running back into the past
Tying to hold on to my love, but you can't make it last forever
So I must confess

I'm missing someone else
This will never be the same
But I blame it on myself
Because I can't make you change

You'll never be my hometown girl

I'm tired of the get around girls
Ain't nothing like my hometown girl"

Never Catch Me (feat. Kendrick Lamar),211,Flying Lotus,"I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this feeling and then I embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Bitch, you're dead


Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me

Chance On Faith,835,Heather Sommer,"I've been flipping pages since I could remember
That told me I had to be within the lines
Of two degrees, a 9-to-5, and
I've been working after work since last September I've been working after work…
I stay up late on the weekdays Late on the weekdays
I never doubt when we say Oh

Chorus
I never wanna look back, and wish I could've been
I'm never gonna regret, the hours I've been putting in
So take a chance on faith Take a chance on… faith
Your mind's a boundless place
Take a chance, take-take a chance
A chance on faith
Take a chance Take-take a chance
Take a chance on faith
Take a chance Take-take
I never wanna look back
Take a chance Take-take a chance

I never wanna look back
Take a chance on faith
Take a chance Take-take a chance

Verse 2
'It's too late now', is something I never wanna say
I stand my ground I stand my ground
I need to be where I'm meant to be, yeah
I don't, see it any other way
I know, I know I gotta keep the faith

Chorus
I never wanna look back, and wish I could've been
I'm never gonna regret, the hours I've been putting in

Someone Else,326,Rezz,"I wake up in the bed you made
The one where you're supposed
to lay with me
I smell you on the pillowcase
But don't see your face
and that's okay with me
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd see you as somebody
I could hate
I guess that's just the price
I pay
For the blood-red flags
that I walked past every day
Who are you when I'm not looking
You're like an angel sent
from hell
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking
you are someone else
Someone else
Someone
Who are you when I'm not looking
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking
you are someone else
Hey
Is it me did I fly you away
Am I wrong
Are you not who I say
If I call which one of you
will answer anyway
Who are you when I'm not looking
You're like an angel sent
from hell
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking
you are someone else
Who are you when I'm not looking
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking
you are someone else

"Million Days (Feat. Hoang, Claire Ridgely)",515,Sabai,"I don't do this often
이런 건 잘 안하는데
You caught me off guard
넌 내 경계를 풀어버렸어
All of my friends said you moved out west
내 친구들 모두 네가 이사갔다고 했지만
You tell me stories underneath sun sets
넌 태양이 떠오를 때 나와 얘기했지

Could it be more than just one night?
우리 하룻밤 인연으로 끝내지 말자
Kiss in the cab ride
차 안에서 키스를 하고
Head turning left right
차 앞머리는 이리저리 흔들리지
Get a ticket for two
두 개의 티켓을 받아서
To wherever you choose
네가 고르는 어디로든 떠나자
Drinking some red out of the blue
우연 속에서 정열에 취하자

You say my name with your accent
넌 내 이름을 네 언어로 부르지
Makes me remember
난 그걸 기억해
How much I missed ya
내가 얼마나 널 그리워했는데
Hope you're planning to stay
네가 계속 머무르기를 바래

안녕

이번엔 내 감을 믿어보지 않을래
Always

I'm not superstitious
난 미신을 믿는 편은 아니지만
I got lucky
이번엔 운이 좋았어
I stole your heart
네 마음을 훔쳤으니까
And it was mine for the taking
이제 내 마음대로 할래

I'm bad at pretending, you know I'll be true
난 안그런 척을 잘 못해, 넌 내가 항상 진심인 걸 알잖아
Sunday mornings, midnight lights
일요일 아침, 한밤의 불빛들
Turn into songs that you watch me write
내가 적었던 노래를 노래로 만들었고
Stole your sweater on that night
그 날 밤엔 네 스웨터를 입었지
You took a picture
넌 사진을 찍었고
I keep by my bedside
난 침대에 누워있었어
So you're mine when you're gone
네가 갔을 때도 넌 내 맘에 있었어
Baby please don't be long
그러니 제발 오래 기다리게 하지마
I got my ticket to the westside
서쪽으로 가는 표를 샀으니까

Stay In Paradise,128,Toby Rose,"Let’s hop on the next plane baby
let’s go
We’ll travel to LA then Tokyo
I don’t care how far
long as we’re close
This summer our love is an open road
So let’s hit the beach
and ride the waves
Just take my hand
let’s run away
Don’t care where we go
if you’re with me
Under the sun making memories
Sitting in our room at a hotel
I’m looking over you and I know well
That if I didn’t know well I know now
I know now
that I found
Something pretty special
Oh you shimmer in the light
We don’t have to go back home
Let’s stay in paradise baby
Let’s stay in paradise now baby
We don’t have to go back home
Let’s stay in paradise baby
The wind in your hair
it stops my heart
Sandcastles and palm trees after dark
Should I propose on the boardwalk
We only just met but you’re all I want
Sippin’ from coconuts is cool
But anything’s cool when it’s with you
Let’s cannonball into the pool
This summer we’ll do what lovers do
Sitting on a bench and I’m speechless
And yeah I really mean that I mean it
I’m hoping maybe now
you’ll believe it
That we fit
‘Cause I see it
You’re something pretty special
Oh you shimmer in the light
We don’t have to go back home
Let’s stay in paradise baby
We don’t have to go back home
Let’s stay in paradise baby
We don’t have to go back home
Let’s stay in paradise baby

Running through my thoughts it’s
One more line we’re crossing
Nothing’s ever gonna stop it
You must be exhausted
Running through my thoughts it’s
One more line we’re crossing
Nothing’s ever gonna stop it
We don’t have to go back home

Justifying every time you lеave

Years (Feat. Matthew Koma),"2,208",Alesso,"The sun hits like a bullet of
faith
And then suddenly
I`m Wild awake
A fake bliss of apologies made
was an enemy with no escape
My handes were tied
but now they`re mine
To grab on to desire and run away
These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years
Years
These will be the years
Years
Grey dust now sparkling gold
and the best is yet to unfold
White heat finding comfort in cold
and her heart was found in her
soul
Her hands were tied
but now they`re mine
to grab on and wherever you go
I`ll go
These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years
Years
These will be the years
These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years"
Sweet Nothing (Feat. Florence Welch),"2,880",Calvin Harris,"You took my heart and you had it in your mouth

And with the word all my love came rushing out

And every whisper it's the worst, empty though by a single word

There is a hollow in me now



So I put my faith in something unknown

I'm living on such sweet nothing

But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hope

I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to love

And it's hard to love

When you're giving me such sweet nothing

Sweet nothing, sweet nothing

You're giving me such sweet nothing





It isn't easy for me to let it go

'Cause

I swallow every single word

And

Every whisper, every sigh

It swept this heart of mine

And there is a hollow in me now



So I put my faith in something unknown

I'm living on such sweet nothing

But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hope

I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to love

And it's hard to love

When you're giving me such sweet nothing

Sweet nothing, sweet nothing

You're giving me such sweet nothing





And it's not enough

To tell me that you care,

When we both know the words are empty air

You give me nothing

Someone I could fall for
So look down

turning around
Hold on me really tight
Baby I want you with me
when we hit the ground
I wanna feel alive again

Just tell me when
You never know
unless you try
Just hold your breath
and close your eyes
I wanna skydive tonight
Flying is a frame of mind
Close your eyes and jump

broken heart
My wings are in repair
So I stay
On the floor
When love is in the air
And it feels like flying
Standing on the
edge of the atmosphere
Hold on my really tight
Baby it's a long
way down from here

From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side

We might as well

What stands behind the North
But I got a feeling
It's a feeling that's we're dying for
Just close your eyes
and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving
till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride
We're burning up

'cause you look a little
different than I left ya
Why you always tryna hide
all that pain behind your eyes
I don't remember
I used to think
that I would always let you
get to me
That I would hear your voice
and hit my knees
And now I feel it all again again
But it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't burn like a coal still hot
And when I see you at the bar
with a honey on your arm
I feel nothing at all
'Cause it don't hurt
No it don't hurt like it used to
And when I see you at the bar
with a honey on your arm
I feel nothing at all"
Shape of You (NOTD Remix),"1,268",Ed Sheeran,"The club isn’t the best place
to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends
at the table doing shots
drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and
start up a conversation
with just me and trust me
I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop put van the man
on the jukebox and then
we start to dance
And now I’m singing like
Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade
for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much
Grab on my waist and
put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead
I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets
smell like you
Every day discovering something
brand new
I’m in love with your body
Oh I Oh I Oh I Oh I
I’m in love with your body
Oh I Oh I Oh I Oh I
I’m in love with your body
Oh I Oh I Oh I Oh I
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something
brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours
about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi
then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like
Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade
for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much
Grab on my waist and
put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead
I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something
brand new
Well I’m in love with your body
Oh I Oh I Oh I Oh I
I’m in love with your body

Into The Wild (Feat. Izzy),438,Kovan,"Can you hear my heart beat calling
Can you feel the love we're falling
Just take my hand and take me home tonight

Throwing caution to the wild

Just take my hand and take me home tonight

We defeat, all impossibilities
Yeah you and me
We’ll take our hearts and run free into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild

Verse 2: Izzy
Running so fast, can you fine me in the dark
Oh baby close your eyes, and listen to the beat of my heart
Take my hand don't be afraid
A love like ours just can't be tamed
Take my heart just feel the beat
We leave tonight and run free

that we're both here all alone

You can take her place tonight
I need somebody in the morning

my heart away from my mind
Hope you know I know

There is more to me

You know what i want
I'll spell it out if i need to
oh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-ohhh
Afraid of the fall
I'll spell it out if i need to

I know what i want
Do you
Won't let you hold me back
Won't let you hold me back
oh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-ohhh
Won't let you hold me back

Wake up, we're through
Not fading out again
Faith in what is new
Blinded by guilt
You were the one to blame
Don't need you, forgot you

You know what i want
I'll spell it out if i need to
oh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-ohhhh

That I wanna be better, not worse, man, it hurts

And I put 'em all together, insert, 'cause I wanna have worth
Working hella hard, till they put me in the dirt
Gonna go far, man, listen to my words
Gonna be a star, man, life's like a blur
When you're working this hard, yeah, you get what you deserve Let's go

I'm nasty, ain't nobody able to catch me
They gasping, they cannot compare, they can't match me

And dancing, hanging on my what She asking to crash with me
Smash with me, she savagely
Wants cash money and she knows that I live lavishly, uh

I'm the man, now I'm teaching the game, a veteran, better than
Anybody else who test me

Cold blooded, no budget, from nothing

It's just a great place to go out, there's something going on every night of the week, the people there are fun and just

I wanna see you walk that walk

We're getting litty like a New York night
You know you're whetting up my appetite
Would you mind if I took just one bite

You got that look in your eye
I take one look and I'm high
Know I'm exactly your type
We fit together so nice
We acting so impolite
No, we don't call it a night
I'll call the car if you like
But first, I wanna see you walk that walk

Baby, walk that walk like
I wanna see you walk that walk

Out of sight

You know you're whetting up my appetite
Would you mind if I took just one bite"

City Of Love,65,Surf Mesa,"These streets are full of angels
Big dreams but turning tables

I thought all the distractions
Would cut the attachment
And get me through

Don't wanna be closer to the truth
Don't wanna be reminded of you
There's no space, there's no room for two
So now I disappear

I'm feeling lonely in the city of love
Thought it'd be different but it's four million
Try to move on but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you ('Cause I think about you)

All full of strangers, I got no one to trust
Following footprints but they turn into dust
Try to move on but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you

'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you

Looks like a simulation
Where everybody's famous
But under the surface
They're hiding, they're hurting, I got deja vu

Now I'm feeling lonely in the city of love
Thought it'd be different but it's four million
Try to move on but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you ('Cause I think about you)

All full of strangers, I got no one to trust
Following footprints but they turn into dust
Try to move on but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you
'Cause I think about you

'Cause I think about you

Now I'm feeling lonely in the city of love
Thought it'd be different but it's four million
Try to move on but something's holding me on
'Cause I think about you ('Cause I think about you)
'Cause I think about you"
Lonely World (ColBreakz Remix),17,K-391,"Do you still remember
All the ways we used to lie?
It was long ago now
I could see the starry skies
Afraid to lose everyone being lonely
Find a place in your heart where you realize
Every love made a mark on your body
And you can see the reason why
Am I just a zombie, am I just a zombie
In this lonely world?
Am I just a zombie, am I just a zombie
In this lonely world?
In this lonely world
In this lonely world
I found my friends in this lonely world
Sally is a dancer
Tommy's working overtime
We are on our phones now
Where love is hard to find
Afraid to lose everyone being lonely
Find a place in your heart where you realize
Every love made a mark on your body
And you can see the reason why
Am I just a zombie, am I just a zombie
In this lonely world?
Am I just a zombie, am I just a zombie
In this lonely world?
In this lonely world
In this lonely world
I found my friends in this lonely world
Sing our songs for the fun of it
And dance with the enemy
Get our sorrows out, laugh is medicine
Let's forget the bad times and go again
And sing for the fun of it
No more sorrow
I found my friends in this lonely world
I found my friends in this lonely world
Am I just a zombie, am I just a zombie
In this lonely world?
Am I just a zombie, am I just a zombie
In this lonely world?
In this lonely world"

your hand running through the moss

You've taken me with you
Can I slow the days
I'll wish that I'll find the faith
I'll die and I'll save your place
and you'll never suffer
and we'll stay together

that one day we're all out of time
I'll write another life
I'm sorry for crying
it's just that I love you
And one day can't be far enough
I had lost my sight
So you sang to me the beauty
you'd been seeing
if I can't stop time
I'll build a world
where God cannot take us
There's no need to think of time
But then you said
Don't think of the time
that's left
you're spending it in your head
I just want you laughing
I'm sorry for crying
I just want you happy
So at last goodbye
I'll be happy
just have to known you

Just tryna find a way
through the darkness Darkness
Money drugs and cars won't help
with all the scars Scars
You gotta hear
what your heart says
Hear what your heart says
So let me oh let me
oh let me breathe
The world has gone crazy

Take all your dreams

I love you
I love you
My love
I love you
I love you
I love you
My love
I wish there was another way
To say the thing I want to say
And not to have to say
I love you
Another way to make a start
To tell you what is in my heart
And how my every thoughts is of you
To find a phrase that says as well
The secret that I long to tell
I've scanned the dictionary's pages
But back to I love you I'll go
Eight little letters in a row
That men have spoken through the ages
I love you
I love you
I love you
My love
We say it in the songs we sing
We're read it in the things of spring
Or as the PS of a letter
A little cliche, quickly said
Familiar as our daily bread
Yet nothing seems to say it better
I might have said a hundred things
My phrases might have taken wings
Free the world or
region hold and clever
But every time I seem to stall
Or three small words to say it all
Three little words that spell forever
I'll shout it from the highest roof
I'll carve it in the trunks of trees
I'll tell the whispering
breeze about you
I cannot hide it anymore
I cannot say it any less
I might as well confess
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
My love
I love you
I love you
I love you
My love
I love you
I love you
I love you
My love

Open up the cage
let the birds fly out
Cause we can't go home

the hearts we broke

Got me lifted like an astronaut
No helmet on

Will disappear and flutter off

in the middle ground
Is where we'll stand
Let go of the brittle

life is a riddle
That we're not meant
to understand
Hold on you said
Just look up and I'll look down
And all your fears
have ran aground
Then you said

was to love like this
All I ever needed
was to feel like something more
Than a closed door
flat on the floor
I can offer so much more
All I ever wanted
was to feel at ease
All I ever needed
was to get up off my feet
'Cause I believe in love
Hold on just a little

Is where we'll stand
Let go of the brittle
'Cause you'll find life is a riddle
That we're not meant

Судно (Борис Рижий),461,Molchat Doma,"Эмалированное судно

Жить тяжело и неуютно
Зато уютно умирать

Окошко, тумбочка, кровать
Жить тяжело и неуютно
Зато уютно умирать

И тихо капает из крана
И жизнь растрёпана, как блядь
Выходит как бы из тумана
И видит: тумбочка, кровать

И я пытаюсь приподняться
Хочу в глаза ей поглядеть
Взглянуть в глаза и разрыдаться
И никогда не умереть
Никогда не умереть
Никогда не умереть
Никогда не умереть
Никогда не умереть

Stay Mine,132,Timmy Trumpet,"Verse 1
Why should we take it slow
When it feels like gold with you
Can't see the end of the show
The part when I'm growing old with you

Pre-Chorus
We made it through some highs and lows
Nothing that I'd undo, I wear it like a tattoo
Feels so right, it could go wrong
Is it too good to be true

Say it, say it, say you'll still be mine
Baby hold me, say I'm the only
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine

And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine

Sometimes I feel afraid, wonder if you feel the same do you
When you'll go, I can't wait
To have you back in my arms
Like we're back at the start

Gone Are The Days (Feat. James Gillespie),788,Kygo,"You were my closest friend
My strength when days gone mad
But I spent my time
in shallow sheets
I should've seen your hand
I didn't see the signs
I was blinded by the lights
And lost where I belong
I thought that we'd grow old
Give kids our bad advice
Now I'm alone
You went and left me
with these sleepless nights
You took my warmth and soul
left me with doubt and cold
Is this where I belong
Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
There's no one here
to savе you from yourself
When you discover it's hard
You don't know how to carry on
Gonе are the days of young
Better run for cover
When everything you love is
lying six feet under I know
You don't know how
but you carry on
These days are longer now
My nights spent wondering why
And I get mad inside
Did you fight back or even try
You didn't see the signs
Were blinded by the lights
You lost where you came from
We're not so different no
We grew up wanting more
But I found it easy
'cause I left my morals
at the door
You took an honest heart
And watched it fall apart
You lost before you started
Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
There's no one here to save you
from yourself
When you'll discover it's hard
You don't know how to carry on
Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
When everything you
love is lying six feet under I
know
You don't know how
but you carry on on
Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
There's no one here
to save you from yourself
When you'll discover it's hard
You don't know how to carry on"
All The Lies,215,Felix Jaehn,"We were gonna go to Paris

When I'm gone you say you want me near
You look me in the eyes say
that we will stay for life
These feelings that we caught won't disappear
Of all the lies I heard
I love you was my favourite
I know goodbyes they hurt
I need to hear you say it
One time before I go whisper it slow
Of all the lies I heard
I love you was my favourite

Known him since you've been at school
Told me I was overthinking like I do
You said I didn't need to worry
We'd get along 'cause he's so cool
Girl you must've thought
I was some kind of fool
You tell me all the things I wanna hear
When I'm gone you say you want me near

You know that my life's in your hands

Madness (Feat. Zak Abel),167,Frank Walker,"When the day has just begun
There's a war inside my head
that can't be won
Lord heaven knows I tried
But I'm a lonely soul
on a broken road tonight
But my heart feels heavy
And my dreams they scare me
You stop the madness
You stop the madness
My feet they fail me
And my mind's not steady
You stop the madness
The madness in me
Oh the madness in me
Oh and now I can see
Oh the madness in me
You stop the madness
You stop the madness
When the world is on my mind
And I feel a little numb
but I don't know why
When it's hard to carry on
I remember what you told me
that it won't last long
But my heart feels heavy
And my dreams they scare me
You stop the madness
You stop the madness
My feet they fail me
And mind's not steady
You stop the madness

Best Is Yet To Come,80,Gryffin,"Oh-oh
Been following signs on the road, ooh
Pretendin' to know where to go
Now we're bending and breaking the mold
Searching for hope, out on our own

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know what comes next, haven't been there yet
But we feel the weight on our shoulders, ooh
It's a wild ride, only got one life
And we'll take on whatever it throws us

Always living on the run (Always living on the run)
Never setting with the Sun (Never setting with the sun)
Our hearts have broken and they've loved (Loved, Loved, Loved)
But we're still young (But we're still young)

Living our life to the full (Life to the full)
Chasing our dreams as we go (Dreams as we go)
When it's taking a toll we will hold on
Searching for hope, out on our own

Number,21,Mark Mendy,"Senorita, listen up
Here we go
They say you are one in a million
I just gotta see for myself
Something ‘bout you feels so familiar
Mysterious like nobody else
Moving it side to side
Like there is no one watching

Just keep that body talking

Then bring it back
Turn off the lights

but don’t say out loud

I can’t get you out of my head

And not do something I might regret

I’m hoping
To get of of this train
and change for good
Maybe take a break I need to slow down
Let’s go out dance under the moon
Come see us
Counting stars like we’re astronauts
Not going home tonight
So fucking high on life
Come see us
Counting stars like we’re astronauts
Not going home tonight
So fucking high on life
Everything is made of
glass and breaking
I don’t wanna think about the mess
Kiss me till the sky lights up
and take me
Away from here, I need another chance
Come see us
Counting stars like we’re astronauts
Not going home tonight
So fucking high on life
Counting stars like we’re astronauts
Not going home tonight

and I'm trippin' off my face

And I hope they will guide me to ya

Pay No Mind (Feat. Passion Pit),"2,567",Madeon,"She was dancing she was smiling
Roses blooming in her cheeks
In a quiet kind of litany
She accepted some defeat
And then she twirled into the arms
Of disgrace and then repelled
Now she's fallen to her knees
But you couldn't ever tell
And then she asked me
how we got here
I told her I don't know
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying so
This isn't what i wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and pay
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
Let it burn as if we'd bothered
We'll make sound based on their eyes
As she closes just to open
There's some sirens wailing by
And as she's off to tell her secret
To her friends somewhere in town
And her friend just takes a moment
And that's why i'm not around
Darling this is something
I should have told you long ago
I just want you to feel safe
I just want to make you glow
How you glowed when we were young
There was nothing on our minds
When you jump for your love
Baby your nothing long of time
And then she asked me
how we got here
I told her I don't know
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying so
This isn't what i wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and pay
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
Why do we have to
go further every time
Some days you hear it
Don't listen i will carry you
Some days you don't
To the universe we'll never go
Sometimes you feel it
It's not worth it help me
Sometimes you won't
Just calm yourself and pay
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any minds"

Blade Down (Feat. Tessa B),"3,005",Synapson,"The blade down
Can you put the blade down
The blade down
Can you put the blade down
You're so so
I feel blue
Don't even recognise myself
That's I want to write down
It was something
the morning this place
I was stuck
when I tried to put the blade down
What this town one way to feel it
Down one way to feel it
I guess I got some clue forget all
It's not worth it
I will fucking stray
That's my only issue
The blade down
Can you put the blade down
The blade down
Can you put the blade down
The blade down
Don't move it's my attitude
I don't belong to you
I am my own crew
And I know it taste
better then a soul food
But you can't buy my love
with a cold boot
Do I make love
I was wiped out
I can understand why you like
Like a tough guy
But you're finished
Like a mission is diminished
So we will not disgrace
Remember the trace
I guess we can escape
And then we book
out of face again
Can we quit this role
that makes me sick
Now you must end the folly
we can stop act quick
Think get us back together
I'm a dope chic
and knock yourself better
So the way I've got 'm crushing
All I gotta to do is paying
For the way I'm beginning
The blade down
Can you put the blade down
The blade down
Can you put the blade down
The blade down
Can you put the blade down"

One Step At A Time (Feat. Natalola),"3,224",Bearson,"What happened to standing up for
Something we believed in
I had my doubts
but you were so sure
Your convincing was deceiving
You had some game
had some good talk
But you couldn't back it up no
Now you say you better have it all
Do you even know the meaning
Easier said than easily done
That is the truth no shame
But still is the heart
That don't fall apart
So I won't resist the pain
I'm taking it one step at a time
When I left you and my old ways behind
I knew that it would hurt for a while
So now I'm taking it one step at a time
Disregard all that I said
In terms of our connection
Be the fool
for being mislead
Are you the walking misconception
I don't mind
I didn't mind flaws
Recognize you got a few of those
Bury them and we move on
'Cause it's the changing
of the season
Easier said than easily done
That is the truth no shame
But still is the heart
That don't fall apart
So I won't resist the pain
I'm taking it one step at a time
When I left you and my old ways behind
I knew that it would hurt for a while
So now I'm taking it one step at a time
Easier said than easily done
That is the truth no shame
But still is the heart
That don't fall apart

I won't resist the pain
I won't resist the pain
I won't resist the pain

Just Hold On,"4,017",Steve Aoki,"Wish that you
could build a time machine
So you could see

Feels like you're
standing on the edge
Looking at the stars

What do you do when a chapter ends
Do you close the book
and never read it again
Where do you go
when your story's done
You can be who you were
or who you'll become
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh
if it all goes wrong
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh

Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh
It's not over 'til it's all been said
It's not over 'til your dying breath
So what do you want them
to say when you're gone
That you gave up
or that you kept going on
What do you do when a chapter ends
Do you close the book
and never read it again
Where do you go
when your story's done
You can be who you were

Just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
Yeah
I can't hear the teacher
His books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys
trying to catch some play
'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile
The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe
Free to paint my toes all day, woo!
My boss is lame you know
And so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black
mini on my charge anyway
'Cause I love your smile
Hey, said I love your smile
Time came and showed me
your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl
With the love you give
You rock my world

I love your smile
I love your smile"

Way more room for activities now
I'm building up my mind
Think I wanna twist the plot this time
No one's home so I play God

I'm not gonna fill it all the way this time
Better than telepathy
I'll show them what's inside my mind
I'm gonna go to Italy
Find my Maradona energy, I

It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you
I walked a million miles
before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head,
sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddеst song
But it was nothing until
you came along
'Cause evеry road that I've been on
Leads me back to you
It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you
I saw a million lines before
I came to you
Guess none of us could read
the lie behind the golden truth
Trust can't be counted on,
It's as crooked as the Amazon
'Cause every road that I've been on
It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I'm looking for you
I walked a million miles
before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head,
sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddest song
But it was nothing until
you came along
'Cause every road that I've been on
Leads me back to you
It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you
Every road that I've been on
It leads me back to you"
Chasing Cars,100,Sofi Tukker,"We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
that's bursting into life
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
And those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we gеt too old
Show me a garden
that's bursting into life
Lеt's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes,
they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
that's bursting into life
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world?"

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been fallin' like a domino
Feelin' like we're running out of time
I resort to turning on the radio
Just so I can try and clear my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But the music's got me feelin' some type of way
Like the words are cuttin' way too deep
They're singin' all the things I've been too scared to say
I think I know what it really means

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been hearin' songs on the radio
From L.A. to Tokyo, tellin' me I can't let you go
You know I've been hearin' songs on the radio
Gettin' mе so emotional, tellin' me I can't lеt you go
Heard it on the radio
'Cause I've been hearin' songs on the radio
From L.A. to Tokyo, tellin' me I can't let you go

What I said to you the other night was wrong
Didn't mean to take it out on you (Out on you)
'Cause when I flip the station, now I hear our song
It's got me thinkin' what did I do? (What did I do?)

[Pre-Chorus]
We said forever, so why would I leave?
The music sounds better when you're with me
'Cause it's singin' all the things I've been too scared to say
I think I know what it really means

'Cause I've been hearin' songs on the radio
From L.A. to Tokyo, tellin' me I can't let you go

Down On You,3,Revelries,"Blinded by lies
Can't see a reason why
You can't look me in my eyes
Don't want to fight now
It's easy to say goodbye

When I take a step closer you take two steps away
When I feel I've getting through
You just feel the need to try to get away
But at the end of the day

What are you going to do
when your heart can't handle the heart you're broken
What you gonna do
when the bridges burn from the words you're spoken
What are you going to do
when the pain gets turned around on you
And the rivers you cried start coming down on you

Coming down on you
Coming down on you
What are you going to do
when the pain gets turned around on you
And the rivers you cried start coming down on you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh ohh ahhh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh ohh ahhh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh ohh ahhh
Down on you
Down on you

Love of my life
I still choose you over paradise
You should think twice
Leaving me is like rolling dice

When I take a step closer you take two steps away
When I feel I've getting through
You just feel the need to try to get away
But at the end of the day

What are you going to do
when your heart can't handle the heart you're broken
What you gonna do
when the bridges burn from the words you're spoken
What are you going to do

You need to give me time

and then things fall apart
If I walk out my house,
the more you still feel, listening

and every stop along my journey
I had wished that you might follow
You were never there behind me

When you enter out the shadows
We can find our way together,

And I know that my life would never be the same

There's no other way I could ever be Without you babe

Falling (Feat. Malika),"3,796",Snakehips,"[Verse 1]

I could have swore I heard you calling

So I came running baby

Lost all control over my feet

Sky was black rain poured in

Still I came running baby

And let my heart take hold of me



[Pre-Chorus]

You got the power

Your sweet your sour

Still you empower

All that I wanna to be

I’m captivated

Your so amazing

All that I’m craving

All that I need oh



[Chorus]

I’ll break down the walls

Cos to you I’m drawn

Do you hear me

I’m gonna fall for you

You can have my all

At your beck and call

Do you feel me

I’m gonna fall for you

Be Be, I’ll be Yours

Be Be, I’ll be yours

Be Be I’ll be yours ohhh



[Verse 2]

I swore that we were getting closer

(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

So I kept running baby

You were the spark to fuel my speed

Had my struggles now their over

(Over )(yes love)

And there’s no more doubt here baby

Because

With you

Just keep on calling

And I'll follow your sound

Behind the worst of us

Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Don't worry 'bout me
I'll be fine
I've coasted through most of my life
Leave it in the past yes
Bury all the caskets
Bury all the caskets
All I know could be made up
All my hopes could be too high
Fight the odds with my bare hands
See my dreams eyes open
I don't know where I'm going
But I know there's a reason
All the places that I've been
All the people that I've seen
No reasons to apologize
We're all fucked up in someone's eyes
I smoke until my lungs burn
I'll love until my heart hurts
Don't worry 'bout me
I'll be fine
I've coasted through most of my life
Leave it in the past yes
Bury all the caskets
CasketsYeah eh
Bury all the caskets
While they come and go
We come and go
While they come and go
We come and go go go go
No reasons to apologize
We're all fucked up in someone's eyes

I'll love until my heart hurts
Don't worry 'bout me
I'll be fine

Get What You Give,849,Felix Cartal,"Wake up kids we've got the dreamers disease
Age fourteen, we got you down on your knees
So polite you're busy still saying please
Frenemies who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night we smashed their Mercedes Benz
First we run and the we laughed till we cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light, light
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight, you've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give
We only get what we give
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

Four AM we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke, but hey we do it in style
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial
But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend, friend
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend, you've got the music in you
You've got the music in you
You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give
We only get what we give
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through

You've got the music in you

Oh oh you've got the music in you"
Something Just Like This (Tokyo Remix),"1,449",The Chainsmokers,"I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly
I don't see myself upon that list

How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss

The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of
person that it fits

How much you wanna risk

Lost & Found (Feat. Matilda),559,Faustix,"I've been playing with fire
Borrowed hearts that weren't for hire
Lookin' for someone
to make it all better
Didn't see that I already had her
Livin' on hope
I followed signs for reckless love
Lookin' for trouble
without even knowin'
What I needed was
everything you showed me
Why don't you tell me
how to make this right?
I'll be waitin' on a bridge tonight
Can't stand another
moment wastin' time
Wastin' time,
we could be lost & found
We could be lost and

We could be lost and

We could be lost and
We could be lost and
We could be lost and
I've been covered in ice
While flyin' too close to the sun
Staying close, losin' touch
Chasin' my shadow
Shoulda known
only you can make it better
Livin' like a ghost
Watchin' us go up in smoke
We're stayin' up, sleepin' in
Broken and shattered
If I say I'm sorry, would it matter?
Why don't you tell me
how to make this right?
I'll be waitin' on a bridge tonight

I'm just tryna figure out mmm
And you need some light
I know it's easy sometimes
And that shit ain't easy
I gave you my whole life
You called me a lowlife
I ain't have the dough
right that's it
But I had goals I
Spent nights on the road
I was tryna bring it
home like last year
You ain't see the vision
So you kept your distance
You left me alone right back here
Thought you had feelings
Talked about children
They woulda had a home
right back here
Now I'm all alone
No one to hold
You left the pieces to my heart
on the floor
How could you go
I couldn't move on
Had to man up and move on
Like forget it I know I'll be one
You regret all your decisions
Now I'm making millions
I just bring it
straight to the cashier
Ain't no checking tags now
Put it in the bag now
It wasn't this way like last year
Girl I know you tripping
Know you wanna kiss me
I know woah you want me back here
But I can't take you
Said we on a break you
Said you wanna wait right back here
Now I let you go
Glad I let you go
Now I'm all alone
but I got money to hold
Why did you go
This couldn't be you and me ohhhh
Now I don't sweat you no more
Like forget it baby now I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
Now I'm the one"

Can't believe in all this time I'm hurting for you
But you feel like home burn
Love you give, it lifts so high I'm dying for it
I'm dying for it
And I can't let you go

Hide away, hide away from me
Hide away, hide away from me
Hide away, hide away from me
Or you lose

If you hide away I'll hunt you down
And follow you to the end of the earth
My heart beats with yours
My lungs breathe with yours
You're a piece of me
I can't hide away

Oh, I'm under your spell
I'm aching and I'm fading
And nobody can see
I'm your heartbeat
You're a part of me

Can't believe in all this time I'm hurting for you
But you feel like home burn
Love you give, it lifts so high I'm dying for it
I'm dying for it
And I can't let you go

Flowers & Superpowers (Kito Remix),277,Wafia,"I've been sitting here for hours
Trying to figure you out
But I get lost in the flowers
I'm really liking the sound
Of laying with you
Damn the sky is so blue
I swear you got superpowers
If I don't wanna talk
could we sit in silence
And if I say way too much
would you stick around
And if I feel low low
low could you take me higher
If I get way too high
would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Is this real life Am I dreaming
I feel a little bit sick
But I'm in love with this feeling
Can't look away from it
Staring at the clouds
Damn this song is so loud
I swear you got superpowers
If I don't wanna talk
could we sit in silence
And if I say way too much
would you stick around
And if I feel low low
low could you take me higher
If I get way too high
would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down
Would you talk me down

Watch it crumble in the light
Nothing can stop you now
See the colors of the sky
Slowly turn from black and white

A rising hope bright as gold

Now there's nothing left to lose
So we're breaking all the rules

Going Down,233,DUBOSS,"Babe just another Friday night
In the kitchen getting high
That’s what we do
Oh but wait
Are we drinking out of pleasure
Or just drinking to forget
what we’ve been through
I heard somebody had sex
in the shower
I know that someone threw up
on the flowers
Tryin to get up
but I don’t have the power
Guess I’m not going home
We don’t give a fuck
No we’re never growing up
Tomorrow it may all be going down
This night won’t ever stop
So come on and fill my cup
Tomorrow it may all be going down
All be going down
All be going down
All be going down
Tomorrow it may all be going down
All be going down

Nothing changes in the end

who walked away
I know what I left behind
Needed space to realign
But now that
I'm gone I wish I stayed

Fragments of Time (Feat. Todd Edwards),276,Daft Punk,"Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear that
I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear that
I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back

Take me back to 505
I sit and you lean back
Kiss and you peep at me
I'm looking in your eyes
They're looking like honey
Got butterflies in my tummy
Said I'm witty, hella funny
Oh, I know I'm fucking funny
When I'm swinging on brandy, lips of candy
Cadillac, we drive away
That time of the month, I get so cranky
Even then, you're here to stay
I'm quite the comedian
When I'm giggling on helium
Oh, I like that you're lenient with me

Sun-kissed skin, cigarette in your mouth
Darling, how I like that, you know how I like that
You know how I like that, I like that, I like that

Always into social smokers
DJ big time, rock 'n' rollers
So fun to be around and I like your skin
I wanna be close to you so let me in
Your heart, your body and your mind
I smile 'n laugh 'n kiss in the sunshine
Dance 'n jump 'n sing through the night time
Body exhausted but you power me like batteries
A bunny, call you Energizer
I'm that Playboy appetiser
How on earth did I find you?

we would go far
Summer nights side by side
Oh I know you remember
how we laughed until we cried
So when you're down
and out from your troubled life
I will be dying for you
dying for you
When all you have is doubt
know that I'm around
I will be dying for you

Pour another glass and keep on fuckin' me around
Walking by the window and I'm reminded that
My thoughts under my pillow containing memories of the
Places where we could have been if it were up to me
I guess that all your promises were just my fantasies

Now I'm addicted to how you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken, oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same old Coldplay song
And every time you turn it on
God knows I can't fix you
But I can't quit you
Quit you
I can't quit you
Quit you
I can't quit you

Remind me once again why I'm repeating
That we can't be more than friends
I'm just protecting myself from the possibility that you could turn me down
Thinking that I'm better off if I don't make a sound

So I'm addicted to how you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken, oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same old Coldplay song

Dunkin' without Sprite, yeah you heard me dirty
I'm from the Show-Me State, show me seven, I'll show you eight
Karats in one bling, heavily starched jeans
Representin' St. Louis every time I breathe
In the city, I touch down and I bob and weave, ay
It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue
(They ain't got a clue)
Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip
(They ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cause we do big thangs on the muh'fuckin' hip, it's a Midwest thang
I sport my beeper on my boots that's why I be a buzz when I kick
Maybe it's on my lips, it's chaos when I spit
Quarter man, quarter schoolboy, half Lunatic
Quarter rubber, quarter dick, other half in yo' shit
Keep a quarter of some shit, I'm the pooky of the backyard
All colors and all types like a junkyard
Hot young boy with hot young ways
'Cause I connect three blunts and be high for three days
You can tell by the way I walk, I ain't from 'round here
Probably couldn't tell 'cause I ain't walkin' nowhere
I got a old-school Cutlass, with a hole in the air
TV's everywhere wood grain to stare
I don't care, hell naw I ain't cuttin' my hair
To the half in them Air force 1's, give me two pair, ugh
I'm from the Lou' and what I do is a Lou' thang
One rapper, two rings and three chains
Nothing but some ole country boys that ride V-12 horses
Saddle up and put spurs on my Air force's
Back porches made for hide and go seek
We got space out here, we can ride and chief
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody approachin' us
By the time they catchin' up, we smoked it up
And my eyes be red, my lips a lil' dark
The Lou is more than the Rams, Cards and lil' Arch
My dirty's love to spark and love to sparkle
Love homies Vokal coats with matchin' car doors
We racin' down Skinker, see how fast our car go
Granny be like ay-yi-yi like Ricky Ricardo
I know you wanna know why we do what we do
You cats ain't got a clue, why the Cutlass blue
Brand new twenty-two's on new UP's
With one, two, three, four, five TV's
It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue
(They ain't got a clue)
Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip
(They ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cause we do big thangs on the muh'fuckin' hip, it's a Midwest thang
I'm sittin' on the front porch, writin' a hood rhyme
Waitin' on my connect to deliver that good line
Wish I would find, one seed in my weed
Sticks and shit if I do somebody bleed
Pull right here, eight pounds of Chinamen
Two stay hittin' some blunts and Heineken
Hidin' in the back with the po' po'
Kicked in my do'do', man they some ho' ho's
They put the gun to my ear, you know the Lord don't fear
Nann nigga, nann hoe, let's keep that bullshit clear
They had me face down in the skreet
Everybody watchin', thinkin' I'ma pull the heat
And leave the D-tects with a leak in the skreet
And that pussy ass nigga that set me up my peeps
Gon' give it to this nigga like NYPD
Beat the K, fuck coke, now I'm back on my granny porch hustlin'
It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue
(They ain't got a clue)
Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip

To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal

Make them dance, just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go

I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you

High on words we almost used
We're fireworks with a wet fuse
Flying planes with paper wheels
To the same achilles heels

Make them dance, just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go, oh


I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you

Yeah, you always make me go, oh

To the speed of light (Turn up your night)
Put your love in lights (Turn up your night)

I get lost, i get lost
When your eyes are on me
I get lost, i get lost

Don't know how to let you go
I gave into the fire
Flames are burning up my soul

I am lost without you
I am lost without you
I am lost
I am lost
I am lost without you
I am lost without you

Trying to find the borders
We cross them, we cross them
Trapped inside a story
That won't end, that won't end

Don't know how to let you go
I gave into the fire
Flames are burning up my soul"

We're out on the edge of it all
Are you ready to freefall
Ready to freefall
We're out on the edge of it all
Are you ready to freefall
Ready to freefall

So feel the pull of an open thread
Unravel life till there's nothing left
It's a long way down but i got you now

Are you ready to freefall

I'm bleeding, but I'm not in pain
Tell me, someone, tell me what is real, what is fake

If it's all in my head, wake me up when I'm dead

The Guardian of Angels,526,Niviro,"I've been watching you
Just come to me
I know where you're hiding
I can see you
It's okay you're safe with me
Let me guide you
You know where to find me
It will be there taking your hand
You meet the unknown
You can't walk away
For some reason
it wants to take you
Having no clue
You don't want to stay
It will be there taking your hand
You meet the unknown
You can't walk away
For some reason
it wants to take you
Having no clue
You don't want to stay
Let me guide you
You know where to find me"

Coming Up,310,SG Lewis,"Under the lights, through the door
The heat was rising
Silhouettes (silhouettes) in the dark
With bodies moving, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, saw a vision I couldn't believe
A fantasy, yeah
Ooh, there you were just right in front of me

[Chorus]
Then you started dancing
Like nobody was watching
I met your eye, as you caught mine
You moved a little closer
And whispered something to me
You said, ""I'm high,"" but so was I

[Post-Chorus]
But now we're coming up together
Coming up
And now we're coming up together
Coming up, coming up, ooh

Fast Car (Feat. Dakota),494,Jonas Blue,"Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone"

Herd of sheep

Honesty is lonely
but I’m stronger than death
I'll be the worst be the worst
you can be the best

I don’t need nobody
but I’ll play this game once
Oh maybe I can believe
in a thing called us oh
You kissed me
real and now I'm fucked

I believe in a thing called trust
I believe there's a fine line
between love and lust
And I know we could lose it
all and finally be rich
I believe I can be my own
favorite bitch
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Don’t take my breath
it's getting harder to breathe
You say Love is blind
but now it's all that I see
Forever takes the longest time
but it’s alright with me
Because I believe
I believe I believe on us
Found ourselves
just to be ourselves
You gave me love now it's all
They say nothing lasts forever
but baby I I
I believe I believe I believe on us
Oh can't believe I believe
I believe in love
Don’t wake me
feels like I’m dreaming
I’ve been waiting for
someone to believe in
And you made me take off
my bad disguise
That's why I do believe and
I cut down on my tree
'Cause you mean that much
to me and your family is strict
Whoa I’m your favorite bitch
Whoa I never thought I’d commit
And we could lose it all
but with you I'd still be rich

Out of My Mind,474,Gryffin,"Hmm
Elevator doors close on you

Confess your mistakes
(And I still stay because I)
Wanted to stay, stay with you


But I can't get you out of my mind
So baby, I'm going out of my mind
No, I can't get you out of my mind
So baby, I'm going out of my mind

Out of my mind (Ah-ah)
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind


Always keep it honest, but I
(Don't know if I was way too)
Honest this time
(You disappeared and I still)
Miss how you lie
Do you miss me?
Tell me I would, do you expect
(Do you expect me to)
Forgive and forget?
(Like nothing happened, I should)
Want this to end
Should I want you? Ooh-ha

"Alone, Pt. II (Da Tweekaz Remix)",437,Alan Walker,"We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call

I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't

We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows

Stay Tight,303,Bloome,"Been driving all night on dusty roads
Wherever we go it feels like home
Light up the fire
when daylight's gone
Chilling our minds
we're playing songs
And I know these days
these days will carry on
Yeah we hang and fight
our sleep till the break of dawn
We stay close together
Yeah we stay tight
We stay close together
Together we stay tight
It's gonna be wild
it's gonna be real
I tell you my friend
our scars will heal
Bottom to top we run those hills
Broaden our minds
we're seeking thrills
And I know these days
these days will carry on
Yeah we hang and fight
our sleep till the break of dawn
We stay close together
Yeah we stay tight
Oh we stay close together
Together we stay tight
We stay close together
Yeah we stay tight

Live A Lie (Feat. Andreas Stone),202,Egzod,"Took a swing at a wrecking ball and
I prayed for my downfall when
I found a way to reconcile
cause in my heart
it’s not worthwhile
it’s a bloody battlefield
where some go down others heal
In the end it’s all the same
all u can do is play the game
oh do we say goodbye
refuse to question why
i’m too sad to say i’m sorry
so lie and pretend that you’re ok
swear that you will stay
keep trying for one day
i’m sick of all these lies
don’y care if I capsize
there’s nothing left for me to hide
don’t want to live a lie
too many lows too many highs
too many things to criticize
so I leave it all behind
don’t want to live a lie
Life kept spitting at my feet
and forced me down
a dead end street when
all I had went up in flames
burning only dark remains
I cover up every part of my skin
oh cause’ I don’t like the person
within no
I know i’m the one to blame
all I can do is take the shame
oh do we say goodbye
refuse to question why
i’m too sad to say i’m sorry
so lie
and pretend that you’re ok
swear that you will stay
keep trying for one day
i’m sock of all these lies
don’t care if I capsize
there’s nothing left for me to hide
don’t want to live a lie
too many lows too many highs
too many things to criticize
so I leave it all behind
don’t want to live a lie
a lie
I don’t want to live a lie
don't want to
live a lie
I’m sick of all these lies
don’t care if I capsize

Over (R3HAB Remix) (feat. Gabrielle Aplin),827,End of the World,"I remember you wanted
To get up close when you're home
Take it straight to the bedroom
I don't know where we lost it
Was it that trip to New York
Was it that party we went to
You used to say things you didn't mean
But this time I felt you meant it
You used to love all the parts if me
But this time you're just pretending
Spilling drinks and spilling feelings
Say you hate me
Say you're leaving
And this time I believe ya
I can't get over that it's over
And now you got closure
I can't deal with this sober
I can't get over that it's over
Or how I'm supposed to
I wish I could hold ya
I can't get over that it's over
I can't get over that it's over
Do you remember that summer
When we went back to your parents
We didn't have to pretend then
Know we skipped a few chapters
We're getting high off the magic
Lost it all when we landed
You used to say things didn't mean
But this time I felt you meant it
You used to love all the parts if me
But this time you're just pretending
Spilling drinks and spilling feelings
Say you hate me
Say you're leaving
And this time I believe ya
I can't get over that it's over
And now you got closure
I can't deal with this sober
I can't get over that it's over

what was the last thing u said (Explicit Ver.),9,aldn,"What was the last thing you said?
It took like over a year to get you out my head
And now I can't sleep
Thinking 'bout everything and all the things we did
And I don't think I miss you
I don't miss the shit that we've been through
But now I'm stuck with this
Try not to reminisce or I think I'll start to miss you
I don't know how to explain it
A year of racking my brain and I hated it
It's like I'm holding onto something that you never did
It's like I'll never have something just like we did
It's like I'll never hold hands with someone again
It's like I'll never introduce them to my friends
I guess it's the end
Just fucking look at you
You moved on so fast, like did you want me in the first place?
I wish you the best, but only mean that in the worst way
Took you only a month to act like everything was okay
You fell right in love with him like I was just a halfway
Now I'm all on my own, need someone to talk to
My friends all abandoned me 'cause they'd rather choose you
This shit is so draining, need to do something brand new
I get tossed up and used then thrown away like some old shoes
Like fucking look at you
I think that you're right, I'm not the person that I used to be
I can't even hide the fact that this was all because of me
I made my mistakes, I let my head get straight to jealousy
All 'cause I thought I'd be the only one you ever see
But you have to remind me, you have to remind me
'Cause I know you said something, something with meaning
It was as I was leaving, I could've been dreaming
You have to remind me, remind me of one thing
What was the last thing you said?
I swear I didn't mean to leave you on read
But now it's morning, everyone's sleeping
And I can't decide if I should get out of bed
Like I don't wanna miss you
I don't miss the shit that we've been through
But now I'm stuck with this
Try not to reminisce or I think I'll start to miss you
It seems like every day I look at the pictures
A couple years of my life in a camera roll
I'm thinking maybe I really miss it
Reliving memories as I start to scroll
It feels like lately I've been stuck and I can't reach my goals
And I can't get myself out, I've been stuck in a hole
I'm really starting to believe it's the end
(Dude, at this point it doesn't even matter, like, f—)
Every time they talk about us, they say we went Hollywood, but
If there ever was a spot to take, I think they probably would 'cause
Every single Zoloft that I take don't do me any good, but
Black hair, black nails, she thinks she's misunderstood, but
She don't know me like she think she does
And I'd be lying if I said I gave a single fuck
And then you push me down and then you pick me up
I'm like one fight away from getting tired and giving up
Just fucking look at you
You moved on so fast, like did you want me in the first place?
I wish you the best, but only mean that in the worst way
Took you only a month to act like everything was okay
You fell right in love with him like I was just a halfway
Now I'm all on my own, need someone to talk to
My friends all abandoned me cause they'd rather choose you
This shit is so draining, need to do something brand new
But after all that was said, I don't regret that I knew you"
"fuck, i'm lonely",34,Kid On The Block,"I call you one time
two time three time
I can't wait no more
Your fingers through my hair

Miss those nights
when you would come over
Spent all night just tryna get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want don't wanna get over
I miss those nights
when you would come over
Spent all night just tryna get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want don't wanna get over you"
Mortal,83,Axel Johansson,"Verse 1
When you said goodbye
But you just can't leave
When you hold so tight
That your hands they bleed
So take these lungs
Cause you were my air
I keep breathing in and out
But you're not there

Chorus
We never think that we run out of time
Always believed we could keep it alive
Didn't know then you were everything
I'm haunted by all the words that I said
Waking up in a hospital bed
I didn't know then you were everything

Post-Chorus
When the time comеs you gotta let it go
When the timе comes you gotta let it go

Verse 2
Every star that lights up the sky
Will always burn the brightest as they die

Chorus
We never think that we run out of time
Always believed we could keep it alive
Didn't know then you were everything
I'm haunted by all the words that I said
Waking up in a hospital bed
I didn't know then you were everything

Post-Chorus
When the time comes you gotta let it go
When the time comes you gotta let it go

Bridge
When the fire dies and there's no light
And I see you for the last time I
I have to let it go
When I lose to the skyline
Can't follow you to the other side I
I have to let it go

Post-Chorus
When the time comes you gotta let it go
When your whole life depends on these hands that you hold
When the time comes you gotta let it go"
Home,69,Zwette,"Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my Ma' and Pa'
Not the way that I do love you
Holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you

Man, oh, man, you're my best friend, I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie, chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La-la-la-la, take me home
Mother, I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park, through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, alleyways and pay phone calls
I been everywhere with you

We laugh until we think we'll die, barefoot on a summer night
Nothing new is sweeter than with you
And in the streets, we run a free, like it's only you and me
Geez, you're something to see

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

Home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you

Oh Laura,199,SG Lewis,"You never struck me as the type
Thought I played my cards right, but I
Didn’t pick up on a tell
Although I thought I knew you well, oh
I guess you never see the signs
Till they’re flashing up in lights, but I
I can see over the hill
‘Cause you’re afraid of
something real, oh
You might think that you know me
And how things are going to be
But I’ve been watching you closely
And you’ve got no future with me
Oh, Laura, I’m cutting you off
I’ve been wanting to tell you
All evening
I’m letting you go
Oh, darling, I’m cutting you off
‘Cause I’m been trying to tell you
All evening
We’re not going home
Remеmber kissing in the rain?
I’ll nevеr say those things again
‘Cause I
Know exactly where you’ve been
And for certain what you did, oh
You really took me for a fool
Just looking for a good time
Stop saying that you care
I’m gonna leave you right here, oh
You might think that you know me
And how things are
going to be(To-to be)
But I’ve been watching you closely

Special,15,Level 8,"Woke up this morning to
somebody in a video, talking
About something I posted in a video
If it wasn't me then would you
even get offended or
Is it just because I'm Black and heavy
Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been
driving slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and
they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new but I been
used to people judging me
That's why I move the way I move
and why I'm so in love with me
I'm used to feeling alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken but damn, you're still perfect
Could you imagine a world
where everybody's the same
And you can cancel a girl
'cause she just wanted to change
How could you throw fucking stones
if you ain't been through her pain
That's why we feel so alone
that's why we feel so ashamed
I know that I'm not alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know
I'm used to feeling alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken but damn, you're still perfect"

Made of Gold (feat. Joakim Wilow),54,TWOPILOTS,"Sometimes you have to let go
If you don’t you’ll get into trouble
Life is the dancer you are the dance
Spread your wings let the wind take your hands

Cause you know the fire burns but it lights up the room
I know it hurts but things get better soon
The darkest time is right before the dawn
Keep your head high eyes on the horizon

And never forget who you are
The sun sets and talk to the stars
And they know, yeah they know, they know
You’re made of gold
You’re made of gold

When there’s a heavy weight breaking your back
Know that light shines right through the cracks
When there’s too much you’re put under pressure
Know that carbon turns into diamonds

Cause you know the fire burns but it lights up the room
I know it hurts but things get better soon
The darkest time is right before the dawn
Keep your head high eyes on the horizon

And never forget who you are
The sun sets and talk to the stars
And they know, yeah they know, they know
You’re made of gold

Never forget who you are
(never forget who you are)
Deep down inside of your heart
(inside your heart)
You know, yeah you know, you know (you know)
You’re made of gold
You’re made of gold
You’re made of gold
You’re made of gold"
Breakaway,20,Martin Garrix,"I was chasing every bright light
But the traces never led me there
I was caving to my own mind
And the grain just never seemed to clear

If I ever need an escape
Oh, you will be my breakaway

Oh, you will be my breakaway
Oh, you will be my breakaway

Oh, you will be my breakaway"

Prayer In C (Robin Schulz Radio Edit),974,Lilly Wood,"You, You never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think i could forgive you
See our world is slowly dying
I'm no wasting no more time
Don't think i could believe you
You, our hands will get more wrinkle
And i hear It will be grey
Don't think i could forgive you
And see the children are starving
and the houses were destroy
Don't think they could forgive you
Hey, when seas will cover lands
And when men will be no more
Don't think you can forgive you
Oh when there's just be silence
And When life will be over
Don't think you will forgive you"
Ten Feet Tall (Feat. Wrabel),845,Afrojack,"Verse 1I'm clumsy
Yeah my head's a mess, cause you got me
Growing taller everyday
We're giants in a little man's world
My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst

Pre-ChorusI'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

ChorusOhhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall

Your safe here, no these arms won't let you break
I put up a sign in the clouds
They all know that we ain't ever coming down

Thinking about the words to say
Try not to understand our feeling
And would it ever go away
Now those were the days
before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
and I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
will you come dancing next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
You told me we would be forever
But maybe we were just too young
I wonder if you still remember
When we were dancing in the sun
Now those were the days

It's not what I've been
used to I confess
So wake up three times a night
Talking to a stranger
is nothing new
She knows how to smile
and unlike you
So I wait for you all night
I know that you hate it
And I hate it
Just as much as you
But if you can brave it
I can brave it
Brave it all for you

If It Weren't For Love,691,Jose Lucas,"If only I can make it through your wall
And find a way to make it flow
But when I rise you make me fall
The more I try the less I know
And we both knew that
feeling inside was turning the tide
And we got lost in the sea of words
I wouldn't be found
with the torches I led at night
If it weren't for love
If only I could reach you
where you stay
And wake you up and break the curse
I'd make it up to you with no delay
The less I try the more it hurts
And well you know
there's never to late
For choosing our fate
And we can walk in the heart of gold
You making me sweat
and I wouldn't be around tonight
If it weren't for love
If it weren't for love
And I remember when we met
Got a feeling that I never get
Was burning eyes we hit it off
And we we dive
If it weren't for love love love love
Love love love love
If it weren't for love
If it weren't for love
If it weren't for love"

Sleepless Nights (Feat. Nightly),"1,304",ayokay,"Midnight
Driving till my eyes give up
Headlights
To your apartment
This ride
I done it 'bout a thousand times
But it doesn't feel right
Here without you

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes me back to windows down in ocean air
Sunset eyes through messy hair
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights

I know that it's over
But it's haunting me
Like a ghost of the summer
I still see

[Chorus]
Midnight drives and summer skin
The taste of liquor on your lips
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights

[Verse 2]
Face up
Watching all the streetlights turn
To shadows
In my apartment
Ten months
I swear, I should be fine by now
But it still gives me a head rush
When I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes me back to
Rooftop, moonlight, silhouettes
Purple skies and cigarettes
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights

I know that it's over
But it's haunting me
Like a ghost of the summer
I still see

[Chorus]
Midnight trudging, summer skin
The taste of liquor on your lips
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights
All those sleepless nights

(I know that it's over
Like a ghost of the summer)"

And I know
The song remains the same

My feet back on the ground
Oh no
I'm not ready for this game

Tell me now
That you're calling back
Feeling that you see it for yourself

Tell me how
Could we lose our track
Feeling that you see it for yourself

My days turn into nights
Though I know
That nothings quite the same

You're moving out of sight
Oh no
Yeah something lost its way

And though we're far apart
I know
We'll always stay the same

It's never been so hard
No choice
I ride it anyway

Tell me now
That you're calling back
Feeling that you see it for yourself

Tell me how
Could we lose our track
Feeling that you see it for yourself

Sometimes you feel like you're the only one
So hold on for better days to come

And when it seems like all is said and done
Just hold on for better days to come

And when it seems like all is said and done
Just hold on for better days to come

So hold on for better days to come
Just hold on for better days to come

The perfect disguise
Do you pay the price
No, you don't (No, no)

When you lead me nowhere?
You take the dark road
And baby, I go there
There's a part of me
Somewhere deep
Down that still believes
That's why I follow
When you lead me nowhere

[Verse 2]
You let my love got aways
You're not gonna change
You're not gonna change
No, you won't (Nah)

Waiting for a change in the weather

I never sat by the shore
under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here
and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free
as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink
so I never swam
I never went boatin'
don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of
what I can't understand
But here I am next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
in Malibu
Next to you
in Malibu
Next to you
in Malibu
We watched the sun go down
as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life
standing here talking
You would explain the current
as I try to smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same
and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while
But here I am next to you
The sky is so blue in Malibu
Next to you
The sky is so blue in Malibu
Next to you

Full of this shit
I cannot confess to you now

Stars Don't Shine,171,Steve Aoki,"Summer nights bottles on ice
Everyone around hanging out
by the campfire
Living life feeling so right
I don't want this night to end yeah
Run it up run it up
til we runnin' out
Cuz enough's not enough
gotta let it out
Never growing old enough
Don't pretend to know too much
Take me far away from here
Where it's cold outside
and the sun don't shine
Just take me far away to somewhere
I can free my mind
All the rules don't apply out here
Woah Woah
It's the sweet escape that
we're waiting for
Woah Woah
Party til the stars don't shine here
Woah Woah
Party til the stars don't shine here
Party til the stars don't shine here
Gonna light it up we gon' celebrate
Pull the cameras out start rollin'
Tonight we gon' make us a moment
Woah
If anybody doesn't hear from me
it's only cuz I'm gone and
I don't need saving
It's like they never wanna let you free
you just gotta break away
doesn't matter what they say now
Take me far away from here
Where it's cold outside
and the sun don't shine
Just take me far away to somewhere
I can free my mind
All the rules don't apply out here

All You,113,Charming Horses,"Come around, looking down

A Moment Of Mystery (feat. Toro y Moi),132,FKJ,"I love the drama
I love the drama
Our conversations
never need completion
I speak in tongues
and I roll my eyes
You get the meaning

Even through the phone
each text is like
a brand new screening
I love the drama
'cause I never know what

Glitch In The Simulation,113,Gryffin,"Damn, I'm still alive
Isn't it great? Sun's in my eyes
Sure, you need rain to make a rainbow
But I haven't worn my raincoat
In sometime, like, almost a year
Since I woke up covered in tears
Lately, my salt stays on the table
But I don't trust that the legs are stable

[Chorus]
When I've got nothin' left to fix
Can't help but think that it's a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile
When I've got way too much to risk
I'm terrified it's just a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile

[Drop]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh
Is it a glitch in the simulation?
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last

[Verse 2]
'Cause I don't wanna move in case it goes wrong
Too much I'm scared of losin'
If this was a roller coaster, I'd be overthinkin' the drop
Stuck at the top

[Chorus]
When I've got nothin' left to fix
Can't help but think that it's a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile
When I've got way too much to risk
I'm terrified it's just a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile

Never Let You Down,81,Beauz,"I was cold, alone

Worst Day,147,ILLENIUM,"Felt my life about to change
Closed my eyes and had a dream
About a lonely place
Where flowers only bloom in gray
All the magic turned to dust
Only memories left of us
That soon will fade away
With the words I never got to say
Almost lost the one thing I got right
Could've been the worst day of my life
Could've been the worst day of my life, I
Thought that I would
have to say goodbye
Could've been the worst day
of my life, of my life
Just when I felt you slippin' out my hands
I guess that Heaven had another plan
Oh, oh
Could've been thе worst day of my life
(Ooh)
I'll never see that tree thе same
The one that we both carved our names
Into with razor blades
Then made out in the summer rain
Oh, I almost lost you like that
Oh, don't wanna think about that
Oh, don't wanna think about that
The thought of you never comin' back
Could've been the worst day of my life
Could've been the worst day of my life, I
Thought that I would have to say goodbye
Could've been the worst day
of my life, of my life
Just when I felt you slippin' out my hands
I guess that Heaven had another plan
Oh, oh
Could've been the worst day
Just when I felt you slippin' out my hands
I guess that Heaven had another plan
Oh, oh
Could've been the worst day of my life"

Disconnect,88,Becky Hill,"I ain't gonna lie to you
Life's been fuckin life-ing

To get me unwinding

Come and get me out this loop
So just switch it up for me
It's time to get loose
If we disconnect
We ain't gotta be aligned
We can redirect
Everything that on our minds, let it go
Change up your frequency and
You'll see how easily you'll disconnect
From everything that's on your mind

Put 'em up high then

Walk On Water (Wooli & Trivecta Remix) (feat. RØRY & Dylan Matthew),44,Slander,"In the middle of the night, the storm is raging in your mind
And you're drowning in the wake we left behind
When the wind is at your door, but you can't hold it anymore
All the voices in your head just tell you lies

I would walk on water, I would turn the tide
I'm sorry more than anything that I left your side
I will raise the echo of all the pain and pride
My God, I would do anything to bring us back to life
I will walk on water, water, ooh
I will walk on water, water, ooh
To get back to you
I will walk on water, ooh
To get back to you

I will walk on water, water, ooh
I will walk on water, water, ooh
To get back to you, to get back to you, to get back to you
I will walk on water, ooh

I will walk on water
I will walk on water
I will walk on water
I will walk on water
I will walk on water
I will walk on water
I will walk on water, ooh
To get back to you

Get back to you, get back to you
I will walk on water, water
To get back to you
I will walk on water
To get back
I will walk on water, water, ooh
To get back to you

I gave you all my love, but it can never be enough
So you took it and you buried it alive
And now you found yourself alone, in this house, it's not a home
Surrounding by the walls you built to hide

I would walk on water, I would turn the tide
I'm sorry more than anything that I left your side
I will raise the echo of all the pain and pride
My God, I would do anything to bring us back to life
I will walk on water, water, ooh
I will walk on water, water, ooh
To get back to you
I will walk on water, ooh
To get back to you

Get back to you, get back to you

The smell of the desert in the air
I love the scouring of the earth
I love the way that it was burnt
I love the sun up in the sky

In a Haze,"2,234",Total Ape,"Now you gotta go
yeah I'm timeless
I get clue like the ice
on my necklace
Got a big ego
I'm not tryna hide it
I'm a pretty boy
meet my boy
can you ride this
Oh no
you caught me red-handed
Oh you know
I'm a cherry lipped bandit
Stealing cars money
wings on me
Drive the streets like royalty
I'm in a haze and I love it
Not just a phase
this is how I do
I'm in a haze and I love it
Got no regrets
this is what I wanna do
What I wanna do
What I wanna do
Land of the lost
yeah this limbo
Riding in the back
'cause my life is that simple
Smoke this blunt
while I'm getting so high
Spread your wings and
I'll teach you how to fly
Lean back it's the making
of a classic
Can't say no 'cause you
just gotta have it
I'll talk till I put you on a leash
My hands aren't dirty
but my shoes aren't clean
I'm in a haze and I love it
Not just a phase

I'm in a haze and I love it

Just Friends (Feat. Amber Mark),722,Chromeo,"I bark you bite
Whatever it is it ain't right
It's not intentional
but tension is running high
My time your world
I sit back and watch it unfurl
They can't blame me
because I'm worried about my girl
We fight every night and day
And make for it right away
This is driving me insane
But I still love you anyway
Yeah anywhere you want to put it
Bite my tongue or bite the bullet
Said a couple things I shouldn't
I would take back if I could
If things fall apart again
I know you know we can go
back to being just friends
May feel like we're wrong in the end but
I know you know we can go
back to being just friends
We can go back to being just friends
Speak once think twice
Looks like you put me on ice
The ice is melting every time
we dim the lights
I'm dim-witted deal with it
You said something slick
I didn't get it
And now I wonder
if our love is counterfeit
All these questions on my mind
Is this all some sort of sign
Is this love or am I blind
Or are we headed for decline
I decline to answer that
But I'm inclined to state the facts
We stay on each other's back
Because opposites attract
If things fall apart again
I know you know we can go
back to being just friends
May feel like we're wrong in the end but
I know you know we can go
back to being just friends
I know you know we can go
back to being just friends
I know you know we can go
back to being just friends
I just can't forget
when you're touching me right
I melt in my head got me
feeling so high
The aftereffect boy
you're fuckin' me up
May not be correct
but I can't get enough
I just can't forget
when you're touching me right
I melt in my head got me
feeling so high
The aftereffect boy
you're fuckin' me up
May not be correct

I just can't forget

I know that you’re good
at being lonely
I can see it in your eyes
You want somebody to hold you
Cause when you’re drinking
you slip up and
put your hands on me
Ain’t your momma ever told you
Just because you’re out here
running doesn’t make you free
I know you’re fine doing life
on your own
But that doesn’t mean you
should spend it alone
Cause boy you’ve
been flying solo for so long
But I think it’s time to
give your heart
Your heart what it wants
Your heart what it wants
Your heart what it wants
Doesn’t all that running
make you dizzy
Come and read between the lines
I can see exactly
what you’re missing
When you gonna realize
That you want somebody
to love you
Cause when it’s late I bet
you’re thinking bout calling me
Ain’t your momma ever told you
Just because you’re out here
running doesn’t make you free
I know you’re fine
doing life on your own
But that doesn’t mean
you should spend it alone
Cause boy you’ve been

Teenage, hopeless, misunderstood
Stars fell around us in a wasted place
You took your parents' car out of town
Lost our minds 'til the sun went down
Sure, we tried to grow up good one day


We were young, kind of foolish
We've down-on-earth kind of friendship
I was beneath and under for you
We gave up on the good life
Put ourselves on the high tide
Never thought it would end this way


We ain't best friends no more
'Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
Two years, no love, no call
Now I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
I guess I'm going solo
I guess I got to let go
We ain't best friends no more
'Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh



('Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh)


We used to keep our world, single [tied?]
With our futures on one line
We're still tigers in a forest fire
But then we lost our stripes, we didn’t care
Said you'd call, I was never there
And we go back to the wilded life


We were young, kind of foolish
We've down-on-earth kind of friendship
I was beneath and under for you
We gave up on the good life
Put ourselves on the high tide
Never thought it would end this way


We ain't best friends no more
'Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
Two years, no love, no call
Now I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh

Don’t Give Up on Love,479,Kygo,"When you're falling backwards

Spiraling out

I know it's bad I think of you

I don't know what it is you do
The moment that you walked into my life
I started to fall head to toe for you
Now I just can't get over
All the games we played
I lose my self in your abuse
You split my heart in two
You split my heart in two
You split my heart in two

Sweet Child O` Mine,28,Melonia,"Verse 1
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long, I'll probably break down and cry

Chorus
Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

Drop

Verse 2
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Chorus
Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

Drop

Outro
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

Set out for something different
But always ends the same

I’m running out of reasons I should admit it
I see you try and a electrify I’m not stayin'
In the moment that the light returns I know that I’m much too late

Good thing I never count my mistakes
Cause I don’t even want to know
I won’t apologize when hearts break
I’m thinking that I’m better off alone

Good thing I never count my mistakes
Cause I don’t even want to know
I won’t apologize when hearts break
Cause baby from the start I told you so
Oh yeah

Sick mind and so short sighted
No other life I know
Stone face but undecided
If I should dive below

I started too ambitious
Now my focus fades
Set out for something different
But always ends the same

(I Dread The Day He Takes You To) Paris [feat. MYRNE],75,Jai Wolf,"Opening night
We’re playing the same
old movie and I’m
Caught in a lie
That I could be better off again
Stuck in a rut
I can't remember the last
I’ve heard from you
Now I’m sick to my gut
I can't remember the last I’ve heard
Said I wouldn't be the one for you
It's getting late and
I'm hearing waves of blue
Saw you on the pier with someone new
And I dread the day
he builds you a palace
Said I wouldn't be the one for you
It's getting late and
I'm hearing waves of blue
Saw you on the pier with someone new
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
Open your eyes
Another cruel reflection, and I’m
Spinning a lie
That I could be better off again
A lingering knot
Now you hold the gun I pulled on you
Now I’m sick to my gut
Now you hold the gun I pulled
Said I wouldn't be the one for you
It's getting late and
I'm hearing waves of blue
Saw you on the pier with someone new
And I dread the day
he builds you a palace
Said I wouldn't be the one for you
It's getting late and
I'm hearing waves of blue
Saw you on the pier with someone new
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
And I dread the day
he takes you to Paris
And I dread the day

Been dancing 'round
not feelin' in the dark
Can't get it out
why can't you tell me now
Oh I've been up all night
wondering why you lie
When your heart is
sayin' more than you do
I feel it every time
That I look in your eyes
Your heart ain't what I always knew
And that’s the truth
Truth aah truth aah
And that’s the truth
Truth aah truth aah

Those things we could have said
On loop inside my head
It's with me everywhere I go
Might be a mistake
But that's a risk I’ll take
If I don't ask I'll never know
Been dancing 'round
not feelin' in the dark
Can't get it out
why can't you tell me now
Oh I've been up all night
wondering why you lie
When your heart is saying

Witchcraft,"1,184",Pendulum,"It's in your eyes, a colour fade out
Looks like a new transition

It's starting up and shaking your ground
Turning your head to see a new day calling

Does it feel like a head to lean on
A snapshot from where you were born
I'm looking for your hand in the rough
You're caught in the wire
Well, I'll lift you up

Leading on the action
Caught in a cell phones rays
Bleeding on a sofa
Staring at the waistline
He's coming and she knows it
Even though she knows why
Footsteps in the hallway
Girl you haven't got time

You gotta get out
Go far away

Darkness in the bedroom
Maybe she is resting up
Maybe she was outraged
Just come back from the club
I can't hear her breathing
Something doesn't seem right
Killer in the hallway
We're living on a set time

We gotta get out
Go far away"

before you trust a stranger

from home her destiny

All this love
Do me right do me wrong
Do me in
you should know
that I'll be okay
All this love
Like a drug I'm not wasting away
if you wonder I'll be okay
All this love
She said I wanna live
I don't wanna die young
I'ma live through the night
just to light up the sun
I don't need to hide
I don't need to run
All this love
All this love
Been a long day
been a long night in the city
How does it feel to sleep
out in the clod
Mama said don't be scared
even in the face of danger
I don't need much
I got all i need to owe

Do me right do me wrong

Give you what you deserve

pick your orange field

up and up
See a performer
a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high
above the flood
It's in your blood
it's in your blood
Underneath the storm
an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison
takes away the pain

Lying in the gutter
aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out
the ocean with a spoon

How can people suffer
how can people part
How can people struggle
How can people
break your heart
Break your heart
Yes I wanna go
yes I wanna feel
Yes I wanna know
show me how to heal it up
heal it up
see the forest staring
at every seed
Angels in the marble
waiting to be freed
Just need love
just need love
When the going is rough

And tear down my walls
So we can let every single
barrier fall
Losing my layers

Found a place, found a place, we could have it all
But I wish I never followed
Innocent, innocent, let into the fall
In the end, innocent, we're not anymore
And now I'm feeling hollow

I'm finding it hard enough to let go let go, let go
And now I'm surrounded by your echo echo, echo
You loved me and then tore me right apart like an animal
And you keep returning like an echo
Like an echo

Let Like an echo
Let Like an echo
Let Like an echo
Let Like an echo

Wondering, wondering, why you keep coming back
Tempted by, tempted by, what we shoulda had
But there's no getting past
What you did, what you did, thinking I would stay
Promises, promises, nothing ever changed
And we were never gonna let

I'm finding it hard enough to let go let go, let go
And now I'm surrounded by your echo echo, echo
You loved me and then tore me right apart like an animal
And you keep returning like an echo
Like an echo

You're like heartbreak stuck on repeat
Like scratches on a CD
You're like heartbreak stuck on repeat
Like scratches on a CD

When you say you need me
When you say you need me
When you say you need me
Please don't say you need me

I'm finding it hard enough to let go let go, let go
And now I'm surrounded by your echo echo, echo

Hear the wind crying out its prayer
Why are we so ashamed to be alive
Break the chains and the freedom's ours to take

Going harder
We are more than numbers
Standing in their shade
Going louder
We are all one color
Standing in their way

Don't look behind your back
Chase the light when the world is getting darker
I have a dream where love's the only side
So take my hand, join the army of the shadows

Going harder
We are more than numbers
Standing in their shade
Going louder
We are all one color
Standing in their way

Join the army of the shadows
Join the army of the shadows
Join the army of the shodows

when I have to let you go
Tryin to keep it all together

Just a babysitter spending
money on liquor
And polaroid pictures
poppin pills its a mixture
Well I was five-two I kept his
head out the clouds
He drives my porche yea
we rev that shit loud
I rest up on his shoulder
as we headed to the bar
We drink in and we driven
and we almost crashed the car
I left my drink on the table
he said I looked graceful
He could tell I was stressed
cus I'm pickin at the label
The last time I smiled
I definitely wasn't sober
But I hav'nt been in days
cus he hasn't been over oh no

Love You Better (Feat. Glades),"2,660",Feki,"Last night I came around from ten till four

Moving too fast to see

That I will love you better than you know
I will love you better

Just know I’m ready to walk out your door

Never know when I'll get home
But I know that homes
where the heart is
Guess I'm better off this way
Moving to better days
But I know that home's
where the heart is
Home's where the heart is
The end this journey
I need not worry
I'll get where I'm going
I made it this far
Beyond where you are
and I'll keep on growing
I miss the opening
The going anywhere
Riding with you
Like we used too
Guess I'm better off alone
Never know when I'll get home
But I know that
homes where the heart is
Guess I'm better off this way
Moving to better days
But I know that
home's where the heart is
Home's where the heart is"

You need my time
and I'm here to watch you
I could be here everyday
Johnny on the spot
Just name the place
and show your face
First I had no clue about you
now I'm all brand new about you
Why girl be my love all night
I'm tryna be cool
but you're too flame
Burnin' up this life of mine
head to toe
Competition ain't even close
You know that I want you girl
You know that I need you girl
You know that I care
I could be anywhere
but I wanna be here with you girl
My mind's here and there
but I wanna be here with you girl
It's okay let 'em stare
I wanna be here with you girl
Girl you always set my love on
Fire fire fire fire fire
Fire talk to me
fire talk to me
Girl you always set
my love on fire
Pinch me babe
say I'm dreaming
All these girls out here
I know they schemin'
They not like you
you should be celebrated
Tonight it's goin' down
but it feels like we elevated
You know that I want you girl
You know that I need you girl
You know that I care
I could be anywhere
but I wanna be here with you girl
My mind's here and there
but I wanna be here with you girl
It's okay let 'em stare
I wanna be here with you girl
Girl you always
set my love on fire
Bedroom callin' bedroom ballin'
I bet you're fallin' in love
in the bedroom
you can't call in
Such confusion
and nothing's solid
Too hard to know
what's right from wrong
So baby talk to me come on
Talk to me come on
Talk to me come on
Talk to me come on
So baby talk to me come on
Talk to me come on
Talk to me come on
Baby talk to me come on
So baby talk to me come on

Waste,464,Rhye,"[Chorus 1]
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this space
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this place
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this

[Verse 1]
Ohhhh...you're waiting in my mind
Ohhhh your face is all I'll find
Oh, on my way

[Chorus 2]
Such a waste I'm waiting out this time
Such a waste I'm feeling all of this now
So many ways to turn this all around
So many ways to make those hidden things found

There's something in the air

[Bridge]
We're going through them changes
We're going through them changes babe...
You're going through them changes babe...
We're going through some changes
Hold my heart

[Verse 2]
It doesn't have a season especially not a fall
I'm giving you my all, mm
It doesn't need a reason to make sense at all
I'm giving you my all

Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this"
Rich & Famous,"1,974",Sjur,"You got me thinkin'
'bout what I know now
Made it my mission
I'll get you back somehow
I was busy lovin' livin'
I was preoccupied
Now I'd give a million dollars
to look you straight in the eyes
Stay in my possession
Because I know now
I always wanted
to be rich and famous
Like Conor in Vegas
I wanted to have it all
But I know that
all the cars and money
Don't make you want me
It's kind of funny
'Cause all I ever needed was you
All I ever needed was you
Here's my admission
And now you know now
Don't need permission no
I'll get you back somehow
somehow
'Cause I really really
really want you back in my life
I I will give a billion dollars
just to look in your eyes
Stay in my possession
Because I know now
I always wanted
to be rich and famous
Like Conor in Vegas
I wanted to have it all
But I know that
all the cars and money
Don't make you want me

'Cause all I ever needed was you

All I Need,536,Dimitri Vegas,"Dimitri, Mike and Gucci

[Verse 1]
Laying on the front lawn, vibing to the bassdrum
Sipping on a 40
And someone's on the rooftop, lighting up like Snoop Dogg
And it's only Tuesday
And we just wanna unwind from this semi charmed life, baby, baby
I don't need, I don't need nothing else
I don't need, I don't need nothing else

[Chorus]
We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life
5AM and we still feeling reckless
Pile up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

[Post-Chorus]
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I just wanna show you how to win, let me coach you
I'm just tryna turn you, baby, turn you to my soldier
Tryna help you prosper, I'm a trail profit
You know they really pocket, they don't really got it
I just wanna see you shop, shop 'til you drop
Pull out with the title top, drop of the lot
She don't want to lead though while she know to not eat
So what the ply bitch? So does Gucci's hard beat

[Chorus]
We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
It's all I need in my life
5AM and we still feeling reckless
Piled up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
It's all I need in my life

[Post-Chorus]
All my friends by my side
It's all I need in my life

[Bridge]
I just wanna have a good time in this semi charmed life, baby, baby
I don't need, I don't need nothing else
I don't need, I don't need nothing else

[Chorus]
We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
It's all I need in my life
5AM and we still feeling reckless
Piled up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
It's all I need in my life"
