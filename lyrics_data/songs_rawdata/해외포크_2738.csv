"10,000 Hours","158,226",Dan + Shay,"Do you love the rain
does it make you dance
When you're drunk
with your friends at a party
What's your favorite song
does it make you smile
Do you think of me
When you close your eyes tell me
what are you dreamin'
Everything I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours
and ten thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes
to learn
that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there
but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours
or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Do you miss the road
that you grew up on
Did you get your middle name
from your grandma
When you think
about your forever now
do you think of me
When you close your eyes tell me
what are you dreamin'
Everything I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours
and ten thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes to

22,"12,024",Taylor Swift,"It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes

For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"14,766",Taylor Swift,"I remember when we broke up
the first time
Saying This is it I've had enough

Whiskey and Morphine,"46,972",Alexander Jean,"I'm wanted for addiction
She's feeling for a thrill

I'm listening to the kind of
music she doesn't like
And she'll never

how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench
thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy
And you've got a smile that could
light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a
while since she brought you down
You say you're fine
i know you better then that
Hey whatcha doing with a
girl like that
She wears high heels
i wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain and
i'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day

Bigger and stronger too
Maybe

Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me"

New York City,"25,574",Norah Jones,"I can't remember
what I planned tomorrow
I can't remember
when it's time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came before
I wanted to think there was
endless love
Until I saw the light
dim in your eyes
In the dead of the night
I found out
Sometimes there's love won't survive
New York City
Such a beautiful disease

New York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful disease

Laura kept all her disappointments
Locked up in a box behind her
closet door
She pulled the blinds
and listened to the thunder
With no way out
from the family store
We all told her things
could get better
When you just say goodbye
I'll lay awake one more night
Caught in a vision I want to deny
And did I mention
the note that I found
Taped to my locked front door
It talked about no regrets
As it slipped from my hand
to the scuffed tile floor
I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie's lullaby
New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful disease

We were full of the stuff
that every dream rested
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattoed conclusion
That the big one was knocking
on the door
What started as a mass delusion
Would take me far from the
place I adore
New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
You are my beautiful
Such a beautiful disease"
Let Her Go,"7,676",Passenger,"Well you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
And you let her go
Staring at the bottom
of your glass
Hoping one day
you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow
and they go so fast
You see her
when you close your eyes
Maybe one day
you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
But you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty
feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow
and it goes so fast
Well you see her
when you fall asleep
But never to touch
and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
and you dive too deep
Well you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
And you let her go
Oh oh oh no
And you let her go
Oh oh oh no
Well you let her go
'Cause you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
And you let her go"
"Take Me Home, Country Road","9,398",John Denver,"Almost heaven
West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountain
Shenandoah River
Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze
Country road take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country roads
All my memories
Gather round her
Miners Lady
Stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty
Painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrops in my eyes
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country roads
I hear her voice
in the morning hours
She calls me
The radio reminds me
of my home far away
And driving down the road
I get a feeling
That I should have been home
Yesterday yesterday
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country roads
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country roads
Take me home country roads
Take me home country roads"

slept late last night

wipe the sleep out of my eyes
Oh uh oh I know
Oh uh oh I won't
Make it out of my bed
if I keep biding my time
I just need some coffee
in the morning
No sugar or tea
'Cause I can feel my eyelids falling
They're trying to sleep
But if I take a sip of caffeine
Then surely I'll be
Awake until the evening
Until we go back to sleep
Now I'm waiting water's boiling
Half asleep
I'm swaying left and right
But suddenly the rich aromas
Drift up to my face and
now I'm thinking
Am I gonna stay awake today
I just need some coffee
in the morning
No sugar or tea
'Cause I can feel my eyelids falling
They're trying to sleep
But if I take a sip of caffeine
Then surely I'll be
Awake until the evening
Until we go back to sleep"

Vincent,"19,207",Don McLean,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy, linen land
Now, I understand what you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now, I think I know what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"
Speak Now,"22,828",Taylor Swift,"I'm not the kind of girl
who should be rudely
bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be
marryin' the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
this is surely not
what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say
don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
fun gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that I was uninvited
by your lovely bride to be
she floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me don't you
don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
it sounds browing out
and they said speak now
I hear the preacher say
speak now or forever
hold your peace
there's a silence
there's my last chance
i stand up with shaking hands
all eyes on me
horrifed looks from
everyone in the room
but i'm only lookin' at you
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely
bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marryin'
the wrong girl
don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
said speak now
and you say
let's run away now
i'll meet you when i'm
out of my tux at the back door
baby i didn't say my vows
so glad you were around
when they said speak now"
Mrs. Cold,"13,571",Kings Of Convenience,"Hey baby Mrs Cold
Acting so tough
Didn't know you had it
in you to be hurt at all
You waited too long
You should've hook me
Before I put my raincoat on
OK I get it
OK can I see
You were fronting because
You knew you'd find yourself
vulnerable around me
OK I get it
OK I see
You feel vulnerable around me

Hey baby
What's going on
You lost control and you
lost your tongue
You lost me
Deaf in my ear
Nothing you can say
is gonna change the way I feel
OK I get it
OK I see
You were fronting because
You knew you find yourself
vulnerable around me
OK I get it
OK I see
I step too close to your boundaries
You wanted nobody around to see
You feel vulnerable around me

Hey baby
What is love
It was just a game
We're both playing
and we can't get enough of
We're both playing
and we can't get enough of
We're both playing
and we can't get enough of"
Mystery of Love,"24,886",Sufjan Stevens,"Oh to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God deliver me
Oh oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh will wonders ever cease
Blessed be the mystery of love
Lord I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other
Oh oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder
reminds me
How much sorrow can I take
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath
Oh oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh will wonders ever cease
Blessed be the mystery of love"
Rocky Trail,"3,263",Kings Of Convenience,"One more time
Let’s say you give me one more time
One last chance to speak again
Let’s start from what we left unsaid
and here we go
Brave enough to go climbing a wall
so high that no sunlight
is seen through winter
Brave enough to go traveling
around the world
without money to eat or sleep for
Seeing what you can do
with your hands and feet
I feel there is no question about it:
Almost anything you can imagine
Almost any goal
You will get there
I wish you had been more of a talker
Not the kind that is
just flapping his lips
And not the kind that looks away
But learns through his eyes
when somebody is watching
Maybe you could have told me
There was a world on your shoulders
that needed lifting
Maybe I could have
helped you with that
The weight is not easy I know
But you never know
I thought your shoes were good
I thought they would take you
to the end of any road
I thought your back was strong
I should have carried you
to the top of the rocky I trail
I should have carried you
to the top of the rocky trail
How am I to know about
your problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
How am I to know about
your problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask"

I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean
I love you, I love you
You are the minutes of my time
You`re inspiration to this rhyme
You are, you are
You are the apple of my eye,
The sweet sunshine in the sky
You are, you are
Metaphorically, this song just says one thing
I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean
I love you, I love you
You are, you are
You are, you are
When cloudy days come along,
When you`re not really
Hear this song and know, just know
If sad times steal your joy
Ring me up and hear my voice
""I love you`s"" tend to mute the noise
Metaphorically, this song just says one thing
I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean
I love you, I love you,
Metaphorically, this song just says one thing
I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean

Speechless,"40,376",Dan + Shay,"You say you'll be down in 5

It happens every time
It's nothing new
It's always on a night like tonight

I'm speechless
Staring at you
standing there in that dress
What it's doing to me

Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm speechless

you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we meet
You take the breath out of my lungs
I can't even fight it
And all of the words
out of my mouth
without even trying
And I'm speechless
Staring at you

That's Us,"10,858",Anson Seabra,"I shoulda known it
wouldn't happen
'cause it wasn't right
I shoulda known it
'cause it happens
every God damn time
Almost thought
we could've been something
Almost thought
we could have tried but
It didn't happen
so I need you to get out my life
But the other night
I had you in my head
Called you on the phone
Want you stealing my time
even though I said
I wanna be alone
Oh and I should know
this could never work
Oh this could never end well
Know it's only human
but I never learn
I want you for myself
I can take the fall the pain
the pleasure
And you can take it all
for worse or better
But oh what if we're wrong
What if we're not all that we thought
Then we won't make it along
But hey I guess that's us
We couldn't help it
but you know that
doesn't make it right
You say I'm selfish
but I know you felt the same inside
Everybody says it's all okay
Everybody says we're fine but
Guess someone else is
what you need to
make you feel alright
But tomorrow night
I'll probably call a cab
Show up at your door
Love you in the night time
leave you in your bed
Cold and wanting more
Oh and I should know
this could never work
Oh this could never end well
Know it's only human

Tears In Heaven,"5,957",Eric Clapton,"Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same

I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven
I'll find my way
through night and day
Cause I know
I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees

Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please

Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know
there'll be no more
Tears in heaven

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong

Cause I know
I don't belong
Here in heaven
Cause I know
I don't belong

Bridge Over Troubled Water,"6,230",Simon & Garfunkel,"When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just
can't be found
Like a bridge over
troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over
troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over
troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over
troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are
on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over
troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over
troubled water
I will ease your mind"
Le Festin,"17,607",Camille,"Les reves des amoureux
sont comme le bon vin
Ils donnent de la joie
ou bien du chagrin
Affaibli par la faim je
suis malheureux
Volant en chemin
tout ce que je peux
Car rien n'est gratuit dans la vie
L'espoir est un plat bien
trop vite consomme
A sauter les repas je suis habitue
Un voleur solitaire
est triste a nourrir
A un jeu si amer je n'peux reussir
Car rien n'est gratuit dans
La vie Jamais on ne me dira
Que la course aux etoiles
ca n'est pas pour moi
Laissez-moi vous emerveiller
et prendre mon envol
Nous allons enfin nous regaler
La fete va enfin commencer
Sortez les bouteilles
fini les ennuis
Je dresse la table
de ma nouvelle vie
Je suis heureux a l'idee
de ce nouveau destin
Une vie a me cacher
et puis libre enfin
Le festin est sur mon chemin
Une vie a me cacher
et puis libre enfin
Le festin est sur mon chemin"

Enchanted,"9,069",Taylor Swift,"There I was again tonight
forcing laughter
faking smiles Same old tired
lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was
enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered
have we met
Across the room your silhouette
starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you

All I can say is I was
enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering queestion
kept me up
2AM who do you love
I wonder to I'm right awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to met you

All I know is I was
enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew

This night is flawless
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
until I see you again
These are the words
I held back as I was
leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love
with someone else
Please don't have somebody
waiting on you
Please don't be in love
with someone else
Please don't have somebody
waiting on you

Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"4,558",Taylor Swift,"We were both young
when I first saw you
I close my eyes and
the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party
the ball gowns
See you make your way
through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo
you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you
Please don't go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden
to see you
We keep quiet
'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town
for a little while oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you
Please don't go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say Yes
Romeo save me
they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid
we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say Yes
Oh oh
And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were
ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you
on the outskirts of town
And I said Romeo save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you
but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet
you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say Yes
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Red,"4,763",Taylor Swift,"Loving him is like
driving a new Maserati
down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind
passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
trying to change your mind
once you're already flying
through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright
just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey
all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing
all you ever wanted was right
there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
trying to solve a crossword and
realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey
all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red
Remembering him comes
in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now
gotta let go
But moving on
from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red
Oh losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey
all alone
Forgetting him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah yeah red
We're burning red
And that's why he's spinnin'
'round in my head
Comes back to me burning red
Yeah yeah

driving a new Maserati

But you're stuck out
in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause darlin' I'm just
tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
hangin' over your head
Yeah there's always been a rainbow
hangin' over your head
It'll all be alright"
The A Team,"10,577",Ed Sheeran,"White lips pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Light's gone day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life
come free to us
'Cause we're just
under the upper-hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside
tonight
And in a pipe
she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary-eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life
come free to us
'Cause we're just
under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside
tonight
And in a pipe
she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes
and hopin' for a better life
This time we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life
come free to us
And we're all under the upper-hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside
tonight
And in a pipe
we fly to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly fly
For angels to fly
To fly to fly
For angels to die"
Run (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault) (Feat. Ed Sheeran),"1,425",Taylor Swift,"Give me the keys
I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so called friends
they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no no
There's a chain 'round your throat
piece of paper where I wrote
I'll wait for you
There's a key on the chain
there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you
And run
like you'd run from the law
Darling let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh we'll run
Ooh we'll run
Ooh we'll run
So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no no
And the note from the locket
you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you
And run
like you'd run from the law
Darling let's run
Run from it all
We can go like
they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh we'll run
Ooh we'll run
Ooh we'll run
There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run
And we run and we run and we run
Like you'd run from the law
And we run and we run and we run
Darling let's run
And we run and we run and we run
Run from it all
And we run and we run and we run
We can go where our eyes can take us
And we run and we run and we run
Go where no one else is run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh we'll run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh we'll run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh we'll run
And we run and we run and we run

Back To December,"10,007",Taylor Swift,"I'm so glad
you made time to see me
How's life
tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good
busier then ever
Small talk
Work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time
you saw me Still
burns in the back of your mind
You gave me roses
and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
Turns out freedom aint
nothing but missing you
Wishing that I realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and make it alright
I go back to December
all the time
These day's
I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back
myself pleading
When your birthday passed
and I didn't call
And I think about summer
all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing
from the Passenger side
Realized that I loved you
in the fall
Then the cold came
the dark days when
fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
and all I gave you was
goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
Turns out freedom aint
nothing but missing you
Wishing that I realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December
all the time
I miss your tan skin
and your sweet smile
so good to me so right
And how you held me
in your arms that September night
The first time
you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably my less dreaming
If we loved again
I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time
and change it
but I can't
So if the chain is on your door
I understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
Turns out freedom aint
nothing but missing you
Wishing that I realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December
turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December
all the time
All the time"

Can`t Help Falling In Love (From Crazy Rich Asians) [Single Version],"4,918",Kina Grannis,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help
falling in love with you?
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
So take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
falling in love with you
For I can't help
falling in love with you"
Red (Taylor's Version),"4,015",Taylor Swift,"Loving him is like driving
a new Maserati down
a dead-end street
Faster than the wind
passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying
to change your mind once
you're already flying
through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright
just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray
all alone
Forgetting him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
But loving him was red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword
and realizing
there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray
all alone Woah
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody
you never met
But loving him was red
Red red red
Red red red
Oh red Red red red
Red red red
Burning red Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Remembering him comes
in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now
gotta let go
But moving on
from him is impossible
And I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red
Oh losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray
all alone Woah
Forgetting him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Red red red red red red
Yeah yeah red
Red red red red red red
Burning red
Red red red red red red
Red red red red red red
And that's why he's spinning
'round in my head
Red red red red red red
Comes back to me

Cayman Islands,"34,989",Kings Of Convenience,"through the alleyways
to cool off in the shadows
then into the street
following the water
there's a bearded man
paddling in his canoe
looks as if he has
come all the way from
the cayman islands

these canals it seems
they all go in circles
places look the same
and we're the only difference
wind is in your hair
it's covering my view I'm
holding on to you
on a bike we've hired
until tomorrow

if only they could see
if only they had been here
they would understand
how someone could have chosen
to go the length I've gone
to spend just one day riding
holding on to you
I never thought it
would be this clear"

You called your momma,
I call your bluff
In the middle of the night,
pull her right back up
Yeah my, my friends say ""Let her go""
Your friends say ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love
for nothin' else

Wonderful Tonight,"3,387",Eric Clapton,"It's late in the evening
she's wondering
what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up
and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me
Do I look all right
And I say
Yes you look wonderful tonight
We go to a party
and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
that's walking around with me
And then she asks me
Do you feel all right
And I say
Yes I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
how much I love you
It's time to go home now
and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her
as I turn out the light
I say My darling
you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling
you were wonderful tonight"
Wasn't Expecting That,"3,930",Jamie Lawson,"It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that
Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed
I wasn't expecting that
Did I misread the sign
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that
You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said
Well I wasn't expecting that
I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were
just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right
to deserve somebody like you
I wasn't expecting that
It was only a word
It was almost misheard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that
I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey I thought you
were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right
to deserve somebody like you
I wasn't expecting that
Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed
If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
I wasn't expecting that
When the nurses they came
Said It's come back again
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that"
Fuerteventura,"6,415",Russian Red,"You're always such a fool

Do yo remember when
we used to live things separate
we hadn't met or thought
that could be possible
I'm glad you had your life
so good to listen to your past
all of those things brought you
with me and now we're two
You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before
But if I try to think
of something better than this
heaven comes down
and reminds the luck we live
You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before"

Too Sweet,158,Hozier,"It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then


Don't you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire
Lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe
I think it's great
But while in this world


I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me





I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong


You know you're bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel
Maybe I'll wait
Until that day


I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me



I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me"

you better now now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in

it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it

And swap it for yours

Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"3,090",Taylor Swift,"We were both young
when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the
flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party
the ball gowns
See you make your way
through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo
you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you
Please don't go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby
just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden
to see you
We keep quiet
'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town
for a little while oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you
Please don't go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story
baby just say Yes
Romeo save me
they're trying to tell me
how to feel
This love is difficult
but it's real
Don't be afraid
we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story
baby just say Yes
Oh oh
And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever
coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you
on the outskirts of town
And I said Romeo save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you
but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and
pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet
you'll never have to be alone
I love you and
that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
go pick out a white dress
It's a love story
baby just say 'Yes'
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
'Cause we were both young
when I first saw you"

If You Want Me,"10,945",Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova,"Are you really here
or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams
from truth
for it's been so long
since I have seen you
I can hardly remember
your face anymore
When I get really lonely
and the distance
causes our silence
I think of you smiling
with pride in your eyes
a lover that sighs
If you want me satisfy me
if you want me satisfy me

Are you really sure
that you'd believe me
when others say I lie
I wonder if you could
ever despise me
when you know I really try
to be a better
one to satisfy you
For your everything to me
and I'll do what you ask me
if you'll let me be free
If you want me satisfy me
if you want me satisfy me

If you want me satisfy me
if you want me satisfy me"
Beautiful Birds (Feat. Birdy),"3,108",Passenger,"Do you remember when we were
two beautiful birds
We would light up the sky
when we'd fly
You were orange and red like
the sun when it sets
I was green as an apple's eye
You said you loved all the songs
that I'd sing
But nothing like you'd ever heard
And I said I loved you
with all of my heart when
we were two beautiful birds
Do you remember when we were
two beautiful birds
We would sing when the morning
would come
You were silver and blue like
the moon when it's new
I was gold as a summer sun
But one day you asked for
a different song
One that I just couldn't sing
I got the melody sharp
and the words all wrong
Those were the last days of spring
To build a nest we pecked
feathers from our chests
Like a book tearing out every page
We weren't to know that these
feathers would grow
Into a beautiful cage"
The A Team,"4,842",Ed Sheeran,"White lips pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Light's gone day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life
come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to
go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the
Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come
free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to
go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the
Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in
life come
free to us
And we're all under the upperhand
Go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to
go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the
Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly fly
Angels to fly to fly to fly
Angels to die"
Breakfast at Noon,48,Tessa Rae,"Breakfast at noon
You bought me fake flowers
I water them too
Laughing for hours
The TV is on
We’re not watching a thing
Your new guitar
Your old worn out sweater
Said we could go far
If you could do better
I know, there’s nowhere left to go
So we just go back to bed
Waiting for something
to change you
Breakfast at noon
The milk has gone sour
A waste of a muse
Logging the hours
The TV is on
Acting like nothing is wrong
Breakfast at noon
I cry in the shower
We call it a truce
Give all my power to you
Do you regret
what I put you through?
Waiting for something
to change you
Let’s go back to the start
Cuz you might just break this heart
The TV is on
We’re not watching a thing
So we just go back to bed
Waiting for something
to change you
Let’s go back to the start
Cuz you might just break this heart"

I Can See You (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),"1,130",Taylor Swift,"Uh-uh, uh, uh
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
Uh-uh, uh, uh
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
Uh-uh, uh, uh
I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note saying, ""Meet me tonight""
Then we kissed and you know I won’t ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself
Uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh

Don't Let Her,"3,982",Walker Hayes,"She always said if something ever
Happened to me she would never
Fall in love again
oh what a waste
We always said we go together
But if I'm just half
of her forever
This goes out
to whoever takes my place
She don't give two sips
'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home
if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth
and your grammar
She loves babies hates glitter
You better shave
'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please don't let her
She's insecure
about her legs right
Something wrong
with her hair right
Just tell her she's crazy Crazy
Even though
she won't believe you nah
Best advice I can give you
brother
Don't ever say
she's acting just like her mother
Even though she does
sometimes Sometimes
It's gon' be our little secret

Too Good to be True,45,Kacey Musgraves,"Made some breakfast
Made some love
This is what dreams are made of
On a cloudy Monday morning
Summers gone and you're still here
For both of us it's been a year
A tidal wave without a warning

Please don't make me regret
Opening up that part of myself
And I've been scared to give again
Be good to me and I'll be good to you
But please don't be too good to be true

In my mind we're in New York
You had never been before
But baby now it's our town

I'll admit that I'm in deep
That I don't know how else to be
And I don't wanna slow down

Please don't make me regret
Opening up that part of myself
And I've been scared to give again
Be good to me and I'll be good to you
But please don't be too good to be true

Made some breakfast
Made some love
If this is what dreams are made of
Please don't wake me"
Wonderful Tonight (Live),"3,053",Eric Clapton,"It's late in the evening
She's wondering what
clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long
blond hair
And then she asks me
Do I look alright
And I say yes
you look wonderful tonight
We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking
around with me
And then she asks me
Do you feel alright
And I say yes
I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful
Because I see
the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just
don't realize
How much I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
She helps me to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn out the light
I say my darling
you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling
you were wonderful tonight"
All Too Well,"2,562",Taylor Swift,"I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt
like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there
at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car
getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down
like pieces into place
And I can picture it
after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
but I'm not fine at all
Oh oh oh
'Cause there we are again
on that little town street
You almost ran the red
'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid
with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories
'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past
thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again
in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well yeah
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing
was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name
of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece
of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all all all
Too well
Time won't fly
it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it
all too well yeah
'Cause there we are again
when I loved you so
Back before you lost
the one real thing
you've ever known
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well"

Elephant,"14,213",Damien Rice,"This has got to die
This has got to stop
This has got to lie down
Someone else on top

You can keep me pinned
It's easier to tease
But you can't paint an elephant
Quite as good as she

And she may cry like a baby
And she may drive me Crazy
'Cause I am lately lonely

So why d'you have to lie?
I take it I'm your crutch
The pillow in your pillow case
It's easier to touch

And when you think you've sinned
Do you fall upon your knees?
And do you sit within your picture?
Do you still forget the breeze?

And she may rise, if I sing you down
And she may wisely cling to the ground
Cause I'm lately horny
So why would she take me horny?

What's the point of this song? Or even singing?
You've already gone, why am I clinging?
Well I could throw it out, and I could live without
And I could do it all for you
I could be strong
Tell me if you want me to lie
'Cause this has got to die

This has got to stop
This has got to lie down, down
With someone else on top

You can both keep me pinned
'Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't make me happy
Quite as good as me

Well you know that's a lie"
Thinkin’ Bout Me,283,Morgan Wallen,"Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

[Chorus]
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

[Verse 2]
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't

Take the Girl,9,Matt Stell,"I used to all night Friday chase it
Wake up still whiskey wasted
Hair of the dog and do it all again

It was a Coke can Copenhagen
That smoke it never faded
And up till now it's where it's always been
I used to take straight shots to get a buzz
But ever since those blue eyes messed me up

I take the girl out rollin' down a back road
Underneath the moon glow
We burnin' all night
I take the girl out, hit a little uptown
Watch her body slow down
Like Makers on ice

When I want my head spinnin'
A fix that never misses
To get the highest high in the world
I take the girl, I take the girl

I take the girl back home to mamma
Cut up at Sunday supper
Still ain't a saint but she's getting me closer

When I raise hell we're together
I swear the rush is better
And I ain't ever hungover

When I take the girl out rollin' down a back road
Underneath the moon glow
We burnin' all night
I take the girl out, hit a little uptown
Watch her body slow down
Like Makers on ice

When I want my head spinnin'
A fix that never misses
To get the highest high in the world
I take the girl, I take the girl

Call me lost cause addicted
No way I can quit it
I'd give up everything else in the world

To take the girl out, rollin' down a back road
Underneath the moon glow
We burnin' all night
I take the girl out, hit a little uptown
Watch her body slow down
Like Makers on ice

When I want my head spinnin'
A fix that never misses
To get the highest high in the world
I take the girl, I take the girl"
The Saddest Thing,"1,499",Melanie Safka,"The saddest thing

And the saddest thing under the sun above,
Is to say goodbye to the ones you love.

All the things that I have known
became my life my very own.

But before you know you say goodbye.
O----h, good time, goodbye

It's time to cry
but I will not weep nor make a scene
just say 'Thank you, life, for having been'

And the hardest thing under the sun above.
Is to say goodbye to the ones you love.

No I will not weep nor make a scene
I'm gonna say 'Thank you, life for having been.'

And the loudest cry under the sun above
Is to silent goodbye from the ones you love."

American Pie,"1,709",Don McLean,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music
used to make me
smile
And I knew if I had my chance
that I could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me
shiver with every paper I'd
daliver
Bad news on the doorstap
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
when I read about his
widowed bride
Something touched me
deep inside the day the music
died.So bye bye Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys
were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love and
do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rook and roll
can Music save your mortal soul and
can you teach me
how to dance real slow?
Well I know that
you're in love with him
cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shose
Man, I dig those rhythm and bluses
I was a lonely teenage
broncin's buck
with a pink carnation
and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
the day the music died.
I started singing bye bye
Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys
were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Now for ten years
we've been on our own
and moss grows
fat on a rollin's stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the Jester sang for the king
and Queen in a coat
He Borrowned from James Dean
and a voice that came
from you and me
Oh, and while the king
was looking down the Jester
stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned,
no verdict was returned
And while Lennin read a book on Marx
the coart took practice
in the park and we SONG
dirties in the dark
the day the music died.
We were singin's bye bye
Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys
were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Helter-skelter in the summer
sweiter
the birds flew off
with a fall-out shelter
Eight miles high and fallin's fast,
it landed foul on
the gress
the players tried
for a forware pass,
with the Jester on the sidelines
in a coat
Now the half-time air
was sweet paerfume
While the sergeants
played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
but we never got the chance
Cause the players tried to
take the field,
the marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
the day the music died
We started singin's bye bye
Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys
were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
In there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space
with no time left to start
again
So come on, Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick
Jack sat on a candlestick
cause fire is the devils
only friend
(Oh) as I watched him on the stage,
my hands were clenched
in festive rage
No angel born in heaven
could break that stan's spell
And as the flames climbed
high into the night
the sacrificial rite I saw satan
Laughing with delight the day
the music died.
He was singin's bye bye
Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys
were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
I met girl
who sang the blues
and I asked her for
some happy news
but the just smiled and turned away
I went down to
the sacred store
where I heard the music years before
But the man there
said the music wouldn't play
The lovers cried
and the posts dreamed
(But) Not a word was spoken,
the church bells all
were broken
And he three man
I admire most the Father,
Son an the holy Ghost
They caught the last train
for the coast
The day the music died.
And they were singin' bye bye
Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys
were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
they were singin' bye bye
Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys
were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die"
loml (feat. Hohyun),233,Sarah Kang,"I know that it might sound dumb
To say that you’re my number one
But I can’t seem to find a way
No other way for me to say
That you transcend my space and time
There really is no reason or rhyme
I just can’t seem to stay away
You light up my naïveté

Who knows how many times we’ll go around the sun
But all I know is that you’ll always be the one
Even if you happen to leave me behind
I will always be yours and you will always be mine
‘Cause you are the love of my life

Even though we sometimes fight
And I want you out of my sight
It only takes a sorry glance
To give each other another chance
And one day we won’t be so young
We’ll try to remember how it once was
And I will trace the lines on your face
And call you by your name

Who knows how many times we’ll go around the sun
But all I know is that you’ll always be the one
Even if you happen to leave me behind
I will always be yours and you will always be mine
‘Cause you are the love of my life"
Delicate,"9,058",Damien Rice,"We might kiss
we are alone
nobody's watching
might take it home

We might make out
when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate
So why do you fill
my sorrow
With the words
you've borrowed
From the only
place you've known
And why do sing Hallelujah
If it means
nothing to you
Why do you sing
with me at all

We might live
like never before
there's nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more

We might make love
in some sacred place
The look on your face
is delicate
So why do you fill
my sorrow
With the words
you've borrowed
From the only
place you've known
And why do sing Hallelujah
If it means
nothing to you
Why do you sing
with me at all
So why do you fill
my sorrow
With the words
you've borrowed
From the only
place you've known
why do sing Hallelujah
If it means
nothing to you
Why do you sing

Last Night,783,Morgan Wallen,"Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you
wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's
tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets
with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' about life
goin' sip for sip, yeah
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up
wantin' you and me
I know that last night
we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything

You told me that you wish
I was somebody you never met

this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
(Last night)
No way it was our last night
(Last night)
No way it was the last night
that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You called your momma,
I call your bluff
In the middle of the night,
pull her right back up
Yeah my, my friends say ""Let her go""
Your friends say ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind
of love for nothin' else
Oh baby,
last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you
wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me
this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night,
we said we'd had enough
I can’t remember everything
we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and
slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me
this ain’t over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)
I know you said this time
you really weren’t comin' back again
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me

Photographs,51,Wild Child,"You may not be home when I called
Maybe I was stoned when I called
Were you not alone when I called
Guess I hated that

I was just asleep when you called
Saw you in my dreams when you called
Should’ve left a note when you called
Would’ve called you back

I’m feeling underwhelmed with the heat of it
Should I stick around try to reason with
How long’s it gonna last if we commit to work it out

[Chorus]
Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How long do I keep photographs?

[Vеrse 2]
I’ve been chasing both of our tails
No one did you wrong, I mеant well
So long ago

Feel like giving in just for the hell of it
Keep you by my side cause you’re so relevant
I know you gave it all but we’ve got more to spend
Let’s stick it out

C’mon let me in cause I fix you up
While you’re looking outside I’ve got so much love
Who’s to say what feels good now will still end up wrong

[Chorus]
Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How long do I keep photographs?

Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How long do I keep photographs?

Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How long do I keep photographs?

Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How long do I keep photographs?"
Glad You Exist (Acoustic),341,Dan + Shay,"Here's to all the late night
drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions
that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate
you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us
There's a couple billion people
in the world
And a million other places
we could be but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and
every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Hey look what a hello
from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like
it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em
'cause you know me
better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else
There's a couple billion people
in the world
And a million other places
we could be but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and
every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Don't you ever go
don't you ever go
don't you ever go changing
Never let me go
never let me go
never let me go baby
Don't you ever go
don't you ever go
don't you ever go changing
Never let me go
never ever let me go
never let me go baby
There's a couple billion people

And a million other places we could be

The Day That I Met You,338,Matilda Mann,"They telephoned me just to say
That nobody had the time for yesterday
And all at once, I felt so small
Started feelin' like nobody cared at all

[Chorus]
But then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
Mm-mm, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
The people talk, it's background noise
I don't wanna hear nobody else's voice
There's somethin' sweet about your scent
It's like lavender came and never left

[Chorus]
And then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
Mm-mm

[Bridge]
Nothin' ever seemed to go right
All my days, they just fell into nights
Until I got a little bit of you in my life
And then, suddenly, everything's bright

[Outro]
I know that there's a million different ways I could say
How you're always the best part of my day
And when you feel the need to forget the world
You can call anytime you want, call anytime you want
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm

Need You Now,"2,395",Lady Antebellum,"Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
but I lost all control
and I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk
and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
but I lost all control
and I need you now
And I don't know
how I can do without
I just need you now
Yes I'd rather hurt

Falls off track with

Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go

much older than me
Why must you roll

"Going, Going, Gone (Acoustic)",84,Luke Combs,"Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leavin'
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
She ain't got one bit of stick around
There's no sense in tryin' to slow her down
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
Going, going, gone

At the tain station
three stops from home
I have half a mind to say
what i'm thinking anyway
But i don't know I don't know
There's an airpane in the sky
With a banner right behind
Loneliness is just a crime
Look each other in the eye
And say hello-o-o-o-o
And say hello-o-o-o-o

I'm Your Man,"2,092",Leonard Cohen,"If you want a lover

And if you want another
kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner
take my hand or
if you want to strike me
down in anger
here I stand
I'm your man
If you want a boxer
I will step
into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver
climb inside
Or if you want to
take me for a ride
you know you can
I'm your man
Ah the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through
these promises to you
that I made and I could not keep
I But a man never got a woman back
not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
and I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please please
I'm your man

And if you've got to
sleep a moment on the road
I'll steer for you
And if you want to
work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father
for your child
or only want a
walk with me a while
across the sand
I'm your man
If you want a lover
I'll do anything
that you ask me to
And If you want another
kind of love"

And then she asks me
Do I look all right
And I say
Yes you look
Wonderful tonight

We go to a party
and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
who's walking
around with me
And then she asks me
Do you feel all right
And I say
Yes I feel
Wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful
because I see the love
light In your eyes
And the wonder
of it all is that you
just don't realize
How much I love you

It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
so I give her the car keys
She helps me to bed
and then I tell her
as I turn out the light
I say My darling
You are wonderful tonight
Oh my darling you are
wonderful tonight"

Speak Now (Taylor's Version),945,Taylor Swift,"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Spеak now""

Fond gestures are еxchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say
Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, ""Speak now"""

Glittery (From The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show Soundtrack) (Feat. Troye Sivan),"4,050",Kacey Musgraves,"You shake me up
and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight
on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
Outside it's coming down
But here inside it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on
and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like
starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
The winter is so gray
feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me
you know you melt it all away
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way
you decorate my heart
Oh so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart"

U-Turn,260,Seth Ennis,"I didn't wanna drop you off
I didn't wanna call it a night
I hope I didn't come across
Like I didn't wanna drink inside
I knew we had chemistry
And I knew it'd hit me sometime
But girl I didn't think the minute
That I pulled out of your drive
You'd make me wanna
U-turn this F150 right around
Whip a one-eighty on
back to your house
Be there in five, I'm betting
No way in hell I'm letting
You turn into the girl that got away
We said goodnight,
but I wanted to stay
I'm halfway home, girl,
it ain't too late
Baby, hit me up and make me
make a U-turn, U-turn, U-turn
A U-turn, U-turn, U-turn
It's hard to keep it
'tween the lines
'Cause I keep picking up
my phone
And I hope there
ain't no blue lights
Waiting for me down the road
I keep on reaching across
the passenger seat
To see if you lost your lip
gloss or an earring
Anything I could use
as a little excuse
To point the headlights
at what's in the rearview
And U-turn this F150
right around
Whip a one-eighty
on back to your house
Be there in five, I'm betting
No way in hell I'm letting
You turn into the girl
that got away
We said goodnight,
but I wanted to stay
I'm halfway home, girl,
it ain't too late
Baby, hit me up and make me
make a U-turn, U-turn, U-turn
A U-turn, U-turn, U-turn
And baby ever since
I got to leaving
(ever since I got to leaving)
You know I been looking
for a reason, any reason
And U-turn this F150
right around
Whip a one-eighty
on back to your house
Be there in five, I'm betting
No way in hell I'm letting
You turn into the girl
that got away
We said goodnight,

I'm halfway home, girl,

If I Didn't Love You,46,Caleb and Kelsey,"I wouldn't mind being alone
I wouldn't keep checking my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy

I wouldn't be losing sleep
Remembering everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doing lately

You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you, I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the ""want you"" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you

I'd try to find someone new (someone new)
It should be something I can do (I could do)
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in

You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you, I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you

Turn the ""want you"" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
Oh, if I didn't love you

Angel Of The Morning,"1,037",Juice Newton,"There'll be no strings
to bind your hands
Not if my love can't
bind your heart
And there's no need to
take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Then slowly turn away from me
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says
we've sinned
Well it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day
Of the years baby baby baby
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling"

Always Gonna Be,315,Dan + Shay,"LYRICS:
Paradise is a swing on a porch
Summertime is a little too short
The best things in life are free
And they’re always gonna be
Hometown is a heaven on earth
Sundays are for football and church
The world turns but I believe
There’s always gonna be

Beer drinking kids on a backroad
Good country songs on the radio
Tailgates falling down on a Friday
Long goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long as the sun keeps coming up
Long as the Mississippi River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some things are always gonna be

Girl your eyes are my favorite blue
I double-take when I wake up with you
I’m so in love with you loving on me
And I’m always gonna be

Holding you close for the rest of my life
Forever and ever baby just like

Beer drinking kids on a backroad
Good country songs on the radio
Tailgates falling down on a Friday
Long goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long as the sun keeps coming up
Long as the Mississippi River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some things are always gonna be

Always gonna hold your hand
Always gonna ask you to dance
Even when we’re pushing 80
You’re still gonna drive me crazy
always gonna be

Beer drinking kids on a backroad
Good country songs on the radio
Tailgates falling down on a Friday
Long goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long as the sun keeps coming up
Long as the Mississippi River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some things are always gonna be
Baby, just like you and me
Some things are always gonna be"

Islands in the Stream,345,Dolly Parton,"Baby when I met you
there was peace unknown
I set out to get you
with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me
that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
needs no conversation
We ride it together huhn huh
Making love with each other huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other huhn hah
From one lover to another huhn hah
I can't live without you
if the love was gone
Everything is nothing
if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us
and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together huhn hah
Making love with each other huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other huhn hah
From one lover to another huhn hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other huhn hah
From one lover to another huhn hah

Somethin' Bout You,97,Mickey Guyton,"It’s hard to put a finger on exactly what you do
But you got me in my feelings, and that ain’t something I’m used to
I don’t mind, I kinda like it, don’t need nothin’ new
You can just keep doin’ what you do

There’s something ’bout the way that you’re lookin’ at me
There’s something ’bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it’s the way I get lost in your eyes
But I can see forever when you give me that smile
There’s something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)
There’s something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)

You being you, babe
It sure gets me in the mood, babe
Why you gotta be so smooth, babe?
It’s so rude, babe
And I just can’t get me enough

Come Back Free,8,Kim Churchill,"I was falling into a hole
I knew it, I had fallen in before
I didn't have the tools or understand the rules to be more

[Pre-Chorus]
I allow myself to see
The truth of how it came to be
Fists uncurl, anger leaves
From the dirt, come back free

[Chorus]
Oh you can come back free, you can come back free
Yeah you can come back free, you can come back free

[Verse 2]
I was lost inside a dream
I knew it, I had been in there before
I'm twisting and I'm turning
Taking my time, welcoming my fears through the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that now I can see
The truth of how it came to be
Fists uncurl, anger leaves
From the dirt, come back free

[Chorus]
Oh you can come back free, you can come back free
Yeah you can come back free, you can come back free

[Bridge]
Made it high in a backward glance
In the moving rain on my way to see clearer
Staring at my fears in the back
In the rear vision mirror
Down the road I pull over
Jump into the river
Close my eyes on the bank I see all that I need to
I'm alive I know that and I'm thanking the teacher
I'm alive I know that and I'm thanking the teacher

[Chorus]
Oh you can come back free, you can come back free
Yeah you can come back free, you can come back free

[Outro]
All of the strength of the fire I've come to borrow
I am holding the weight in the night
Who knows tomorrow"
Taking Back My Heart,124,Anthony Lazaro,"It would be so easy, babe
To come and say I love you and
Pretend that this was
all just a bad dream
We would dance a waltz around
Make a big smile right at the camera
Pretend that things are
easy as they seem
But there's a crack
that's running through my heart
I never knew that it was crystal
That our love could be so brittle
But it's looking
Like it's gonna fall apart
And it was so nice baby
But I'm afraid, I'm taking back my heart
We never wanted this to end
And it's so hard to understand
When something
that you love just disappears
We've been grasping at a shadow
Filled the void by talking louder
Pretended the voice inside was
just a fear
But I feel like
the curtain is coming down
And I think there's no surprise
Cause we've been knowing it for a while
And I’d wish
we could go back to the start
And it was so nice baby
But I'm afraid, I'm taking back my heart
But there's a crack
that's running through my heart
I never knew that it was crystal
That our love could be so brittle
But it's looking
Like it's gonna fall apart
And it was so nice baby
But I'm afraid, I'm taking back my heart"
Traffic In The Sky,"3,237",Jack Johnson,"There's traffic in the sky
and it doesn't seem to be getting much better
there's kids playing games on the pavement
drawing waves on the pavement
shadows of the planes on the pavement
it's enough to make me cry
but that don't seem like it would
make it feel better
maybe it's a dream and if I scream
it will burst at the seams
this whole place will fall into pieces
and then they'd say...
Well how could I have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
if you keep adding stones
soon the water will be lost in the well
Puzzle pieces in the ground
But no one ever seems to be digging
instead they're looking up
towards the heavens
it's enough to make me cry
but that don't seem like it would
make it feel better
the answers could be found
we could learn from digging down
but no one ever seems to be digging
instead they'll say...
Well how could I have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
if you keep adding stones
soon the water will be lost in the well
Words of wisdom all around
but no one ever seems to listen
they're talking about their plans on the paper
building up frm the pabement
there are shadows from the skyscrapers
on the pavement
it's enough to make me sigh
but that don't seem like it would
make it feel better
the words are all around
but the words are only sounds
and no on ever seems to listen
instead they'll say...
Well how could I have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
if you keep adding stones
soon the water will be lost in the well"
The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"1,437",Taylor Swift,"I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very first night
And so it goes
Every weekend the same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know
about the night in the hotel
We were riding
in the car when we both fell
Didn't leave a note
in the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very first night
And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
And we broke each other's hearts
But don't forget
about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen
chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about
the words that we whisper
No one knows how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
I remember
the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car
when we both fell
whisper
Do you know how much I miss you
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
I miss like you it was the first time
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you"
Father And Son,"4,367",Cat Stevens,"It's not time to make a change
Just relax take it easy
You're still young that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me I am old
But I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on
But take your time think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not
How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment
I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away
I know I have to go
It's not time to make a change
Just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young that's your fault
There's so much
you have to go through
Find a girl settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me I am old
But I'm happy
All the times that I've cried
Keeping all the things I know inside
And it's hard but it's harder
To ignore it
If they were right I'd agree
But it's them they know not me
Now there's a way and I know
I have to go away
I know I have to go"

daydreaming,2,Luise Najib,"I wake up with the biggest smile
I take the longest and deepest breath
I watch the dusts dance in the sun ray
Peeking through my slightly open curtain

I open my window and smell the morning
While listening to the neighbors birds sing
I let the godly light touch my face
I let myself fall for its embrace

You’re on my right
Then you hold me tight
I am thereupon sent to the heavens

So this is what it feels like
To love and then be loved back

I keep believing it’s gonna happen
Replaying it over and over again
I keep it dearly, close to my chest
Though sometimes it feels like I need a rest

‘Cause you’re not by my side
You’re not holding me tight
I don’t have my favorite sight

And this is what it feels like
To love and not be loved back

I’m just daydreaming
I’m sitting in bed believing it’s early morning
Not 11 AM as I am

Dreading to get up
Finding reasons to keep going"

April Come She Will,146,Simon & Garfunkel,"April come she will
When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again

July she will fly
And give no warning
to her flight
August die she must

live like you're free then you'll see
That time is just a remedy for
Nothing but sweet love
For nothing but our love girl
I want to tell you
but I can't seem to get it to you
I want to love you
but I just can't give it to you
Baby tell me what can I do
When I can't help
but fall in love with you doorudoonu
I know it's you
I want to tell you
but it might lead to disaster
I want to love you
but I'm scared of what will happen after
Baby tell me what's left to do
when I can't help but fall in love with you
I want to tell you
but I can't seem to get it to you
I want to love you
but I just can't give it to you
Baby tell me what can I do
When I can't help
but fall in love with you doorudoonu woo
I know it's you"

Layla,644,Eric Clapton,"What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.

Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
Turned my whole world upside down.

Chorus

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane.
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain.

Chorus

Don't You Worry About Me,"1,540",Eighty,"Don't you worry about me
Time is over let me free
Flying in to the sky
Maybe I should know why
Dreams are not so far behind
Don't you worry about me
I will go where life leads me
I will be so strong
The autumn wind has gone
And still the days go on and on
Don't you worry about me
You will never find a girl like me
There is no one else
No matter what you search
What you'll get will be a mess
do I do I do I do
do I do I do I
baby don't you think it's true
Don't you worry about me
Time is over let me free
Flying in to the sky
Maybe I should know why
Dreams are not so far behind
Don't you worry about me
I can run in NY's streets
Singing in to the sun
Laughts and smile enough
Drink something like a superstar
do I do I do I do
do I do I do I
baby don't you think it's true
If there is a way
I'll find it someday
I start to play a a a a
If there is a way
To make me sway
do I do I do I do
do I do I do I baby
don't you think it's true"
Try to Remember,508,The Brothers Four,"Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green
and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender
and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow
Try to remember
when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember the time of September
When love was an ember
about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
The fire of September
that made us mellow
Deep in December our hearts
should remember
And follow, follow, follow"
Speechless,"7,782",Dan + Shay,"You say you'll be down in five

Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out

Can't even fight it
And all of the words
out of my mouth
without even tryin'

The Blue Team,166,Honig,"Tell me why would the dark
put a smile on your face
Guess I know how
Cause you do love to keep
all your secrets
Maybe that’s odd
but your demons will chase you
I cannot say so but oh
I don’t know why they should though
You possibly can’t use it
But you know that
Cowboys like quite shows
And the maker of that show
you know you know you know
In a way you did know
There was no luck involved
But still you think so
You have no idea
what you wish for
Maybe we’re all gonna
miss what you gave us
Maybe you’ll hate us
But how should we know
who is to be trusted
You possibly can’t use it
But you know that
Cowboys like quite shows
And the maker of that show

Shape me up with pills to take
Tell me why the bellyache
Give me more
I'm sorry now about it
Give me more

Run myself a clear green bath

I Should Probably Go To Bed (Acoustic),466,Dan + Shay,"All of my friends
Finally convinced
Me to get out of the house
To help me forget
To help me move on
Then I heard you're back in town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me
that you were coming
So
I should probably go to bed
I should probably
turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning
I'll be calling
Saying sorry for the things I said
So I should probably go to bed
So I don't undo
The got over you
That it took so long to find
'Cause all it would take
Is seeing your face
And I'd forget
I should probably go to bed
I should probably
turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning
I'll be calling
Saying sorry for the things I said
So I should probably go to bed
Before I question my decision
Is it love I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know I don't
Have the self control
To walk away if you walk in
I know I should probably go to bed

Good Things,"1,554",Dan + Shay,"Said some things I ain't proud of
I wish I could take back
Never meant to make you
hurt like that no
For a while it was perfect
You made my world standstill
Oh and something
about you always will
So when it's late at night
and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends
or you're lonely
When you hear somebody
start to say my name
Oh when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you
Picture that night in Portland
We drank three bottles of wine
I said I love you
'bout a million times
And then we drove to Seattle
And just to kiss in the rain
Now when it's pourin'
do you see my face
So when it's late at night
and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends
or you're lonely You're lonely
When you hear somebody start
to say my name
Oh when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you
Think of the way
that I started to shake
when I held you
for the first time
And every kiss that our lips
made feel like New Year's Eve
at midnight
Think of the 3AM conversations
all of the big dreams
that we were chasin' down
And if I ever cross
your mind somehow
When it's late at night
and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends
or you're lonely
When you hear somebody
start to say my name
Oh when you think of me
I hope you think good things"

Fever Dream (Album),"6,690",iron & wine,"Some days her shape in the
doorway
Will speak to me
A bird's wing on the window
Sometimes I'll hear her when
she's sleeping
Her fever dream
A language on her face
I want your flowers like babies
want God's love
Or maybe as sure as tomorrow
will come
Some days like rain on the
doorstep
She'll cover me
With grace in all she offers
Sometimes I'd like to just to
ask her
What honest words
She can't afford to say like
I want your flowers like babies
want God's love
Or maybe as sure as tomorrow
will come"
Lego House,"6,163",Ed Sheeran,"I'm gonna pick up the pieces

And if you're broken
I'll mend you and keep
you sheltered from the storm

I'm out of love

And out of all these things

And colour you in

and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it

And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of love

can't talk straight at you

really meant to say is

I can't deny that I've had it
It's just a sweet little sadness
And yeah I've felt it before
But it's nothing much
compared to yours
So fundamentally toxic
You know it wasn't your fault then
There's so much we can't hold
Oh you know
you were just a little boy
I remember everything you said
All about how it is just

Nothing calms me down quite

And I’m spinning out

I’ve been there before I know
how it turns out

the air ain’t no sweeter
Hold me ‘cause I’m spinning out
When I’m alone in silence

I Want You,541,Stephen Sanchez,"I've been oversleeping so much

boxes pass along and I wish
That I was sitting in one with you
With you
I will be your friend,
but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way,
just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour,
if you'll have me, I want you
You've been overthinking
so much,
the traffic in your head
Oh, they rush at the thought
of someone new
Laurеn, why can't you accept it?
I love you
and I'm not pretеnding
when I say those words to you
I will be your friend,
but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way,
just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour,
if you'll have me, I want you Lo
If I learn to love myself,
will it keep you
from loving someone else?
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know
If learning to love
would cost my life,
I'd spend it all on you and I
I will be your friend,
but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way,
just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour,

At Seventeen,"2,468",Janis Ian,"I learned the truth
at seventeen
That love was ment
for beauty queens
And high school
girls
With clear skinned
smiles
Who married young
and then retired
The valentines
I never knew
The friday night
charades of youth
Were spent on
one more beautiful
At seventeen
I learned the truth
And those of us
with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social
graces desperately
Remained at home
inventing lovers
On the phone
who called to say
Come dance with me
and murmured
Vague obscenities
it isn't all it seems
At seventeen
a brown eyed girl
In hand me downs
whose name
I never could
pronounce
Said pity
please the ones
Who serve
they only get
What they deserve
and the rich
Relationed hometown
queen
Marries into
what she needs
With a guarantee
of company
And haven
for the elderly
Remember those
who win the game
Lose the love
they sought to gain
In debentures
of quality
And dubious
integrity
Their small town eyes
will gape at you
In dull surprise
when payment due
Exceeds accounts
received at seventeen
To those of us
who knew the pain
Of valentines
that never came
And those whose names
were never called
When choosing side
for basketball
It was long ago
and far away
The world was younger
than today
When dreams were
all they gave for free
To ugly duckling
girls like me
We all play the game
and when we dare
We cheat ourselves
at solitaire
Inventing lovers
on the phone
Repenting other
lives unknown
That call and say
come dance with me
And murmur vague
obscenities
At ugly girls like me
at seventeen"

Electric Touch (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault) (Feat. Fall Out Boy),597,Taylor Swift,"Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm"
Lady Weeping At The Crossroads,"3,130",Carla Bruni,"Lady weepinng at the crossroads
Would you meet your love
In the twilight
with his greyhounds
And the hawk upon his glove
Bribe the birds
then on the branches
Bribe them to be dumb
Stare the hot sun out of heaven
That the night may come
Starless are the nights of travel
Bleak the winter wind
Run with terror all before you
And regret behind
Run until you hear the ocean`s
Everlasting cry
Deep though it may be and bitter
You must drink it dry
drink it dry
Wear out patience in the lowest
Dungeons of the sea
Searching through
the stranded shipwrecks
For the golden key
Push on to the world`s end
pay the
Dread guard with a kiss
Cross the rotten bridge
that totters
Over the abyss
There stands the deserted castle
Ready to explore
Enter climb the marble staircase
Open the locked door
Cross the silent empty ballroom
Doubt and anger past
Blow the cobwebs from the mirror
See yourself at last
See yourself at last
Put your hand behind the wainscot
You have done your part
Find the penknife there
and plunge it
Into your false heart"
Rocketeer,"7,828",Stephanie Dan,"Here we go, come with me
There`s a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
Close with you here, I`m a rocketeer
Let`s fly Fly fly fly fly
Up here we go
Or Let`s fly Fly fly fly fly
Where we go, we don`t need roads
Where we stop nobody knows
To the stars if you really want
Got a jetpack with name on it
Above the clouds and the atmosphere
Say the words and we outta here
Hold my hand if you feelin scared
flyin` up, flyin` outta here
Here we go, come with me
There`s a world out there that we should see
Up here we go
Take my hand

Up take my hand

Up here we go
Or Let`s fly Fly fly fly fly
We can stay fly like a G6
Shop the streets of Tokyo
Boy, You, your always on my mind
Got my head up in the sky
where we at, only few have known
On some next level, super mario
Hope this works out, cardio
Until then let`s fly
Geronimo
Here we go, come with me
There`s a world out there that we should see

"Puff, The Magic Dragon",616,"Peter, Paul & Mary","Puff the magic dragon
lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
in a land called Hanalee
Little Jackie Paper
loved that rascal Puff
and brought him strings
and sealing wax
and other fancy stuff
Oh Puff the magic dragon
lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
in a land called Hanalee
Puff the magic dragon
lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
in a land called Hanalee
together they would travel
on a boat with billowed sails
Jackie kept a lookout perched
on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princess
would bow when there they came
Pirate ships would lower
their flads when Puff
roared out his name
Oh Puff the magic dragon
lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
in a land called Hanalee
Puff the magic dragon
lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
in a land called Hanalee
A dragon lives forever
but not so little boys
Painted wings and giants rings
make way for other toys
One gray night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon
he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow
Grief scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
along the cherry lane
Without his life long friend
Puff could not be brave
So Puff that mighty dragon
sadly slipped into his cave
Oh Puff the magic dragon
lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
in a land called Hanalee
Puff the magic dragon
lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
in a land called Hanalee"
Sunshine On My Shoulders,874,John Denver,"Sunshine on my shoulders
makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always make me high
If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you a day just like today
If I had a song that
I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to
make you feel this way
Sunshine on my shoulders

Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always make me high
If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that

Holes Inside,"2,424",Joe Brooks,"When all that you`ve tried
leaves nothing but holes inside
It seems like you`re wired to stay here held in time
Cuz nothing seems to change oh no.
No nothing`s gonna change at all.
I can see it in your face the hope has gone away.
If you hold tight shadows will be lost in the light.
Oh cuz sometimes fate and your dreams will collide.
So don`t walk away from me
Don`t walk away from me
Don`t walk away from me. yeah
Your feet are stuck no they cannot move
Don`t tell me that they`re glued
Sure they`re far from.
At home at ease but give sometime to breathe
Cuz nothing seems to change oh no.
No nothing`s gonna change at all.
I can see it in your face the hope has gone away.
But if we hold tight
shadows will be lost in the light.
Oh cuz sometimes fate and your dreams will collide.
So don`t walk away from me
Don`t walk away from me
Don`t walk away from me oh
Cuz everthing will be ok
I know that it`s so easy to say
But the pain inside will fade
Please tell me that you`ll stay.
If we hold tight shadows will be lost in the light.
Cuz sometimes fate and your dreams will collide.
When all that you`ve tried
leaves nothing but holes inside"

Tattoos,61,Georgia Webster,"Verse 1
You said you wanted me forever, never met someone like you
Said we'd always be together, yeah, you promised me the moon
No, there ain't much we can say we didn't do
You took almost everything I had to lose

Chorus
You were my first kiss, first love
First drink, first drunk
First pickup truck where I said that I loved you
First on my skin, well, I almost did
Thank God I never went with you
Thank God we never got tattoos

Verse 2
Yeah, you made me reckless, made me wanna do the things I'd never do
Something stupid, just to prove it, something now we can't undo
Yeah, you even called some shady place downtown
Kind of crazy when I think about it now

Chorus
You were my first kiss, first love
First drink, first drunk
First pickup truck where I said that I loved you
First on my skin, well, I almost did
Thank God I never went with you
Thank God we never got tattoos
Mmm, thank God we never got tattoos
Mmm

Thank God you broke my heart in
That one-bedroom apartment
Thank God I never went with you
Thank God we never got tattoos
Thank God I learned my lesson
I wish I never met you
Thank God the first ain't with you

Self Love,96,Avery Anna,"""You're so pretty""
I say that to a random girl in the bathroom
I forgive my stupid exes like I have to
Text my friends just to say, ""I'm checkin' on you""

[Pre-Chorus]
What it must be like to be
On the other side of me
Always smilin' nice and sweet
Deep down in reality

[Chorus]
I hate the way ""self-love"" sounds
I hate that I need some right now
I hate this dumb self-love song
'Cause I'm the only one, I don't let my
Self love
Self love

[Verse 2]
I was supposed to write out ten things I like about me, I
Only got to three, what doеs that say about therapy? I
Posted a caption sayin' ""treat yoursеlf nice""
For the life of me, I can't seem to take my own advice

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what it must be like to be
Thrivin' in high self-esteem
Confidence is so mainstream
Maybe it's just not for me

[Chorus]
I hate the way ""self-love"" sounds
I hate that I need some right now
I hate this dumb self-love song (Self-love song)
'Cause I'm the only one, I don't let my
Self love
Self love
Self love
La-da-da
Self love

[Bridge]
What it must be like to be
Anybody else but me

I hate the way ""self-love"" sounds
I hate that I need some right now
I hate this dumb self-love song (Self-love song)

Always Need You,"4,331",Melissa Polinar,"I've made up my mind
To get tangled up with you
Even though I'm undeserving
More than the sunshine
Up in the great big blue
You satisfy my every yearning

You hit the center of my heart
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you
Always need you ohhhh yeahh
Now that I'm here
Everyday is new
I'm not going to look any longer
It's all so clear
Everything pales to you
Oh your love just makes me stronger
Like a shadow tied to your heel
I'll follow wherever you go
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you
I wanna climb to the top
of a hill somewhere
And scream at the top of my lungs
The rain may come but I don't care
I'm gonna keep tellin' everyone that
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you

You Light Up My Life,335,Debby Boone,"So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song
So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life"
El Condor Pasa,836,Simon & Garfunkel,"I'd rather be
a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would
if I could
I surely would

I'd rather be
a hammer than a nail
Yes I would
if I only could
I surely would
Away I'd rather sail away
Like a swan
that's here and gone
A man gets tied up
to the ground
He gives the world
its saddest sound
Its saddest sound

I'd rather be
a forest than a street
Yes I would
if I could
I surely would
I'd rather feel
the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would
if I only could
I surely would"
Need You Now,"3,148",Lady Antebellum,"Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I can't fight it any more
And I wonder if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost
all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do
without I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost
all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do
without I just need you now

Yes I'd rather hurt than
feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call
but I'm a little drunk
and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do
without I just need you now
I just need you now

Oh baby I need you now"
Dolce Vita,977,Ely Bruna,"We're walkin' like in the Dolce Vita
This time we got it right

Mmm gonna drink tonight
We're dancin' like in a Dolce Vita
With the lights and music on
Our love is made in a Dolce Vita
Nobody else than you
It's our last night
Together with our love again
Another light
Before we're thrown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me now
We made it down in the Dolce Vita
Wipe all your fears away
We live like in Dolce Vita
Our game of yesterday
I'm so alone in the Dolce Vita
Oh baby telephone
This magic is gone in the Dolce Vita
Nobody else than you
It's our last night
Together with our love again
Another night
Before we're thrown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Oh say you're gonna love me now
It's our last night
Together with our love again
Another light
Before we're thrown in darkness
So say you'll never leave me now
Oh say you're gonna love me now
Just say you're gonna love me now
Just say it again

Make You Feel My Love,"1,986",Bob Dylan,"When the rain is blowin' in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening
shadows and the stars appear
And there is no
one there to dry your tears
I could hold you
for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made
your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the
moment that we met
No doubt in my mind
where you belong
I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
No there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging
on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regrets
The winds of change
are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothin' like me yet
I could make you happy
make your dreams come true
There's nothing that
I would not do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love"
take what you need (Acoustic Version),81,Lewis Watson,"Think my heart might just run out my love
If we fight for another day
I used to be something you wanted
But It's different
We're different because now when

You tell me you need me
I walk away bleeding and
Now I can see that
I'm on my own

How's this love when
I'm left with nothing
You take what you need and run
Cold and numb when
You up and leave me
You take what you need and run

When your heart is running out my love
Do you always run away
I know that you used to feel something
But it's different
We're different because now when

You tell me you need me
I walk away bleeding and
Now I can see that
I'm on my own

How's this love when
I'm left with nothing
You take what you need and run
Cold and numb when
You up and leave me
You take what you need and run

How's this love when
I'm left with nothing
You take what you need and run
Cold and numb when
You up and leave me
You take what you need and run"
How Can I Tell Her,514,Lobo,"She knows when I am lonesome
She cries when I am sad
She's up in the good times
She's down in the bad
Whenever I am discouraged
She knows just what to do
But girl
She doesn't know about you
I can tell her my troubles
She makes them all seem right
I can make up excuses
Not to hold her at night
We can talk of tomorrow
I'll tell her things
that I wanna do
But girl
How can I tell her about you
How can I tell her about you
Girl please tell me what to do
Everything seems right
whenever I'm with you
So girl won't you tell me
How to tell her about you
How can I tell her
I don't miss her
Whenever I am away
How can I say it's you I think of
Every single night and day
But when is it easy telling
someone the truth
Oh girl
help me tell her about you
How can I tell her about you
Girl please tell me what to do
Everything seems right
whenever I'm with you
So girl won't you tell me
How to tell her about you"
Volcano,"5,223",Damien Rice,"Don't hold yourself
like that
You'll hurt your knees
I kissed your mouth
and back
But that's all I need
Don't build your
world around
volcanoes melt you down
What I am to you
is not real
What I am to you
you do not need
What I am to you
is not what you mean to me
You give me miles
and miles of mountains
And I'll
ask for the sea

Don't throw yourself
like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth
your back
Is that all you need
Don't drag my love
around that
volcanoes melt me down
What I am to you
is not real
What I am to you
you do not need
What I am to you
is not what you mean to me
give me miles
and miles of mountains
And I'll ask
for what I give to you
Is just what i'm
going through
This is nothing new
No no just another
phase of finding
what I really need
Is what makes me bleed
And like a new disease
she's still
too young to treat
Volcanoes melt me down
She's still too young
She's still too young
She's still too young
She's still too young
She's still too young
She's still too young
She's still too young
She's still too young

Anchor,"1,558",Novo Amor,"Took the breath from my open mouth
Never known how it broke me down
I went in circles somewhere else

Storing up on your summer glow
You went in search of someone else
And I hear your ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in
My dear is it all we've ever been
Caught the air in your woven mouth
Leave it all I'll be hearing
how you went
In search of someone else
They taught the hand
that taut the bride
Both our eyes locked to the tide
We went in circles somewhere else
And I hear your ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in
My dear is it all we've ever been
Anchor up to me love
Anchor up to me love
Anchor up to me love
Oh anchor up to me
My love my love my love"
Out of the Blue,246,Jessica Allossery,"I never thought that I would find you
All the years were passin' on through
Even though l wanted true love
My happy ending was in doubt
I thought my time had run out
I didn't know how it felt to be loved
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It was then that I knew
We would be two just me and you
Me and you
Now together like ouu ouu ouu
Feel the love comin' through
Right out of the blue
Out of the blue
You came out of the blue
And I love you I do
We have a gift a beautiful romance
And I love the way it happened
Eloping in Vegas
me in my white dress
It is never too late
for a new chapter
For love ever after
New adventures and laughter
Mmmmmm
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It was then that I knew
We would be two just me and you
Me and you
Now together like ouu ouu ouu
Feel the love comin' through
Right out of the blue
Out of the blue
You came out of the blue
And I love you I do
Finally the universe aligned
After all this time
I hope we never have to be apart
But if we do you're in my heart
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It was then that I knew
We would be two just me and you
Me and you
Now together like ouu ouu ouu
Feel the love comin' through
Right out of the blue
Ouu ouu ouu
ou ou ou ou ouu ouu ouu
Ou ou ou ou ouu ouu ouu
Ouu ouu ouu
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It was then that I knew
It's just me and you"
Someone You Loved,633,Madilyn Bailey,"I'm going under and this time
I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really
got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
somebody to know
Somebody to have
somebody to hold
It's easy to say
but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way
you numbed all the pain
And now the day
bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to
get me through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being
someone you loved
I'm going under and this time
I fear there's no one to turn to
Ohh-oh-oh
This all or nothing way of loving
got me sleeping without you-u-u
Now I need somebody to know
somebody to heal
Somebody to have
just to know how it feels
It's easy to say
but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way
you help me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
to get me through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being
someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes
when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound
till I come back around
And now the day bleeds
into nightfall
And you're not here to get me
through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being
someone you loved
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
to get me through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being
someone you loved
I let my guard down

River,781,Joni Mitchell,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of
joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy
scene I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
He tried hard to help me
You know he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the
best baby That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of
joy and peace
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on"
Queen Of Hearts,520,Juice Newton,"Midnight
and I'm a waiting
on the twelve oh five
Hoping it'll take me just a
little farther down the line
Moonlight
you're just a
heartache in disguisel
Won't you keep my heart
from breaking
if it's only for a
very short time
Playing with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
thinking 'bout a
life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you
Honey
you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody
telling everybody
what you have done
Baby
I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing
out the heartaches
you know you got to
have you some
Playing with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
thinking about a
life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you

Lovers
I know you've had a few
But hide your heart
beneath the covers
and tell 'em
they're the only one
And others
they know just
what I'm going through
And it's a hard
to be a lover when
you say
you're only in it for fun
Playing with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
Playing with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
thinking about a
life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you
Playing with the

Rocky Trail,"1,607",Kings Of Convenience,"One more time
Let's say you give me
one more time
One last chance to speak again
Let's start from
what we left unsaid
And here we go
Brave enough to go
climbing a wall
So high that no sunlight
is seen through winter
Brave enough to go
traveling around the world
Without money to eat or sleep for
Seeing what you can do
with your hands and feet
I feel there is no question about it
Almost anything you can imagine
Almost any goal you will get there
I wish you had been
more of a talker
Not the kind that is just
flapping his lips
And not the kind that looks away
But learns through his eyes
when somеbody is watching
Maybe you could have told me
Thеre was a world on
your shoulders that needed lifting
Maybe I could have
helped you with that
The weight is not easy I know
But you never know
I thought your shoes were good
I thought they would take you
to the end of any road
I thought your back was strong
But I should have carried
you to the top of the rocky trail
Carried you to the top
of the rocky trail
I should have carried you
to the top of the rocky trail
How am I to know about your
problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
How am I to know about your
problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask"

Ayy yeah oh
Just because you're married
doesn't make me
care about your other love
the one's you love
It's true that I'm no Aphrodite
but I think
that i really might be the one
When I hear you're name
oh I feel like I am drawn
Catch myself just staring
yeah all my pride is gone
Just because you scare me

Tom's Diner,"5,354",Suzanne Vega,"I am sitting In the morning
At the diner On the corner
I am waiting At the counter
For the man To pour the coffee
And he fills it Only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking Out the window
At somebody Coming in
It is always Nice to see you
Says the man Behind the counter
To the woman Who has come in
She is shaking Her umbrella
And I look The other way
As they are kissing Their hellos
I'm pretending Not to see them
Instead I pour the milk
I open Up the paper
There's a story Of an actor
Who had died While
he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking For the funnies
When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so I raise my head
There's a woman On the outside
Looking inside Does she see me
No she does not Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection
And I'm trying Not to notice
That she's hitching Up her skirt
And while she's Straightening
her stockings
Her hair Is getting wet
Oh this rain It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening
To the bells Of the cathedral
I am thinking Of your voice"

a little too long for me
to be your friend
And boy you were looking
at her a little too short
for me to be yours
And I've been really too nice I know
You probably thought that
we were just a show
But you better listen up
you better listen close
I don't think so
I think I should go
I can feel your eyes look at me
and the door
Oh I can take a hint
Oh I can take a clue
You're giving me the go sir
You're giving me the boot

So you better listen up
You better listen close

Cheers To The Night,958,Caroline Grace,"I've been less in my best

But I'm too tall in my little white dress
Hands too short
and I try to express that I'm a tryhard
when the teacher is their
Always say yes and I don't know why
'Cause the boys want sex
while the girls want time
Life's always greener on the other side

I would rather be home in my bed
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink cheers to the night
Ohh ohh
This new girl
that you know was never me
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink cheers to the night
I feel weak and I need
This person I perfected
But who cares
I don't wanna be rejected
Look in the mirror
and tell me acceptance
Care don't much about
others perception
I never really wanted to loose my way
But I got caught up
in what the world might say
Life's always greener on the other side
So I take one drink cheers to the night
Ohh ohh
I would rather be home in my bed
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink cheers to the night
Ohh ohh
This new girl
that you know was never me
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink cheers to the night"

Old Boyfriends,553,Phillip Vo,"I scrolled down your insta page
Saw a picture that I didn't wanna see
He had his hand around your waist
And a smile on your face
like the way you look at me
Cause only eight months ago
he was holding your hand
Slow dancing and
kissing the top of your head
And I, don't know
how to compete with that
'Cause you were friends
since you were kids
And still feels like we just only met
Yeah, I was so naive
Thinking that you've only
felt this way for me
You always tell me I'm the only one
you wanna be with
So why can't I believe it?
Yeah, old boyfriends kinda scare me
Cause they all gotta' little bit of
history with you
Even when you try to tell me
I got no real reason to worry, my
Mind starts to imagine things
that never happened
I start to believe that
you’re still in love
With some other has been,
baby I’m just asking
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last one?
The last one?
I’ve heard stories about exes
Calling up brides on their wedding day
Professing all the love
from a once upon a time
that that threw away
And the fear that that
I’m fighting is constantly
rising in the back of my mind
Is that you’ll finally
open up your eyes
That you’ll leave me for another guy
Yeah it’s a scary truth
That maybe I don’t know you
in the way they do
You always tell me I’m the only one
you wanna be with
So why can't I believe it?
Yeah, old boyfriends kinda scare me
Cause they all gotta' little bit of
history with you
Even when you try to tell me
That I got no real reason to worry, my
Mind starts to imagine things
that never happened
I start to believe that
you’re still in love
With some other has been,
baby I’m just asking
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last one?
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last one?
Baby the hardest part
Is fighting back this anxious heart
But I have come to realize that
if we don’t have trust then
We might as well have nothing
But old boyfriends still scare me
They all gotta little bit of
history with you
Even when you try to tell me
I got no real reason to worry, my
Mind keeps on imagining
Things that I know aren’t happening
I start believe that
you’re still in love
With some other has been,
baby I’m just asking
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last one?
Last one, do you think
I'm gonna be the last one?"

I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

"Flightless Bird, American Mouth","4,509",iron & wine,"I was a quick wet boy
Diving too deep for coins
All of your straight blind eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog eared map
And called for you everywhere
Have I found you
Flightless bird jealous weeping
Or lost you
American mouth
Big bill looming
Now I'm a fat house cat
Cursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide
white fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures thrown
in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream
Have I found you
Flightless bird
brown hair bleeding
Or lost you
American mouth
Big bill stuck going down"
Southern Nights,"2,083",Glen Campbell,"Southern nights have you ever felt a
Southern night free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes
that you know and love so
Southern nights
just as good even when
Closed your eyes I apologize
To any one who can truly say
He has found a better way
Southern skies have you ever noticed
Southern skies it's precious beauty
Lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through
your soul like the stories of old
Old man he and his dog
they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy
Feel so good
feel so good it's frightening
Wish I could stop
this world from fighting
La da da da da da la da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Mysteries like this and many others
In the trees blow in the night
In the southern skies
Southern nights
They feel so good it's fright'ning
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting

Better Than Revenge,"2,534",Taylor Swift,"Now go stand in the corner
and think about what you did

Ha

The story starts when it was
hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him
right there where I wanted him
She came along got him along
and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than
you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming
nor did I suspected it
I underestimated
just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain
was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just
who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known for the
things that she does
On the mattress
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do
better than revenge

She lives her life like it's a
party and she's on the list
She looks at me like
I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present
frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho
Cause I like to rhyme her
name with things
but
Sophistication isn't
what you wear
or who you know
Or pushing people down to
get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that
in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses
gives you dignity
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known for the things
that she does
On the mattress
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do
better than revenge Ha ha
I'm just another thing for you
to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to
roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but I always get the last word

She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known for the things
that she does
On the mattress
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing
I do better than revenge
And do you still
feel like you know
what you're doing
Cause I don't think you do Oh
Do you still feel like
you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much
better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than
you can say sabotage"

Bold Move,219,Jack Buster Weston,"Sitting in my driveway
Underneath the night scape
Covered by the car shade
Trying to find the words to say
Been planning this for hours
Hiding notes inside your flowers
Was not the time to be a coward
That time was ours
So tell me how to pause that night
I see beauty when I close my eyes
For a moment everything was right
And sometimes
I start to think that
If nothing lasts forever dear
Lets remember
what we had right here
Under the stars
where we disappeared
And I said those words to you
Baby thats a bold move
The perfect line
I wrote about a thousand times
You said keep your eyes
inside of mine
And don’t hide
Then your eyes smiled
So we stayed there for a while
Our fears pushed
ten thousand miles
Just focused on you
So tell me how to pause that night
I see beauty when I close my eyes
For a moment everything was right
And sometimes
I start to think that
If nothing lasts forever dear
Lets remember
what we had right here
Under the stars
where we disappeared
And I said those words to you
Baby thats a bold move
Now I know
I know nothing about this
How you came in my life that day
In god's grace we were surrounded
And I heard you say
you felt so safe
So tell me how to pause that night
I see beauty when I close my eyes
For a moment everything was right
And sometimes
I start to think that
If nothing lasts forever dear
Lets remember
what we had right here
Under the stars
where we disappeared
And I said those words to you
Baby thats a bold move"

Everything Changes,48,Ross Copperman,"Black coffee in our favorite cups
We used to like the sweeter stuff
Thought I'd say it, but you said it first
We look nothing like the way we were
You wanna go to parties now
We used to never leave the couch
Thought you'd say it, but I'll say it first
Don't say another word

[Chorus: Ross Copperman & Cam]
We're just, we're just different people
We're not innocent people
A thousand sorry's from where we started
I guess we're just goin' through phases
Wеarin' different faces
You know еverything changes, darlin'
Don't, don't be sad
'Cause the time that we had wasn't meant to last
Everything changes, everything changes

[Verse 2: Cam]
You met me at a brighter time
Now you see me in a different light
Hard to see you in a room this dark
It'll never be the way it was
'Cause you wanna go to parties now
We used to wanna settle down
Thought you'd say it, but I said it first
Don't say another word

[Chorus: Ross Copperman & Cam]
We're just, we're just different people
We're not innocent people
A thousand sorry's from where we started
I guess we're just goin' through phases
Wearin' different faces
You know everything changes, darlin'
Don't, don't be sad
'Cause the time that we had wasn't meant to last
Everything changes, everything changes

[Post-Chorus: Ross Copperman]
Everything changes (Ooh), everything changes (Ooh, ooh)

Wonderful Tonight,"1,013",Eric Clapton,"It's late in the evening
She's wondering what
clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long
blond hair
And then she asks me
Do I look alright
And I say yes
you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking
around with me
And then she asks me
Do you feel alright
And I say yes
I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful
Because I see
the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just
don't realize
How much I love you

It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
She helps me to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn out the light
I say my darling
you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling
you were wonderful tonight"
The Joke,"4,835",Brandi Carlile,"You're feeling nervous
aren't you boy
With your quiet voice
and impeccable style
Don't ever let them
steal your joy
And your gentle ways
to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt
in your face
Dress you down
and tell you that your place
Is in the middle
when they hate the way
you shine
I see you tugging
on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it
and hide how much it hurts
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin
let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies
I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
You get discouraged
don't you girl
It's your brother's world
for a while longer
We gotta dance
with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream
call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt
in your face
To call you weak
and then displace you
After carrying your baby
on your back
across the desert
I saw your eyes
behind your hair
And you're looking tired
but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin
let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies
I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin
let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies
I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them"
THE RIVER IN THE PINES,388,Joan Baez,"Oh Mary was a maiden
When the birds began to sing
She was sweeter
than the blooming rose
So early in the spring
Her thoughts were gay and happy
And the morning gay and fine
For her lover was a river boy
From the river in the pines
Now Charlie he got married
To his Mary in the spring
When the trees were budding early
And the birds began to sing
But early in the autumn
When the fruit is in the wine
I'll return to you my darling
From the river in the pines
It was early in the morning
In Wisconsin's dreary clime
When he rode the fatal rapids
For that last and fatal time
They found his body lying
On the rocky shore below
Where the silent water ripples
And the whispering cedars blow
Now every raft of lumber
That comes down the Chippewa
There's a lonely grave that's
Visited by drivers on their way
They plant wild flowers upon it
In the morning fair and fine
'Tis the grave of two young lovers
From the river in the pines"
And I Love You So,892,Don McLean,"And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know
how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
and the night won't set me free

But I don't let the
evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my believe
And yes I know
how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
but I don't let the
evening bring me down
Now that you're around me
And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them
I don't know"
Kiss Me,"3,300",Ed Sheeran,"Settle down with me

Lie down with me yeah
and hold me in your arms
And your heart’s

I Always Miss You,486,Indianna Dawn,"I always miss you but today
it's worse
You'll burn a bridge or die
from thirst
you've seen your dreams
Homely scenes can crush
you like a bug
I always miss you but today
it's worse
You'll gain a mile just for
a while
I know it's hard to travel
when the rope
Is tied in one end
The sound of the train comin
round isn't there
And I'm scared as a cat it will
all disappear
You can sow your oats
Run a mile ahead
Break your legs or stay
in bed
Hide for months or lose
yourself
Leave me twice or wake
up for once
Cause if you keep this up
you're gonna lose me
Oh and I don't wanna
be lost
I always miss you even
when you're here
Weve had some fights let's
leave it there
Oh I wish you'd tell me
something
don't leave me here with
nothing right now
How I wish you'd come home
in the night and prove me wrong
That you'd take away all the
fears that haunt my bones
You can sow your oats
Run a mile ahead
Break your legs or stay
in bed
Hide for months or lose
yourself
Leave me twice or wake up
for once
You can sow your oats
Run a mile ahead
Break your legs or stay
in bed
Hide for months or lose
yourself
Leave me twice or wake up

Cause if you keep this up

Today,422,John Denver,"Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows
shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy
that is mine Today
I'll be a dandy
and I'll be a rover
You'll know who I am
by the songs that I sing
I'll feast at your table
I'll sleep in your clover
Who cares what the morrow
shall bring
Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows
shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy
that is mine Today
I can't be contented
with yesterday's glory
I can't live on promises
winter to spring
Today is my moment
now is my story
I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing
Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows
shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy
that is mine Today
Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows
shall all pass away

Stay Out Of Trouble (CF - 캔 맥스웰하우스 조인성편),"4,206",Kings Of Convenience,"I walked around for hours
two ten pence pieces in my hand

I was alone and freezing
still trying hard to understand you

I left the others knowing
I had to work this by myself

but now the feeling's growing
I would be better off with their help

so baby what we've got has lately
not been enough
not been enough

I wish I had your scarf still
that once embraced and kept me warm

I wish you could be with me
in these last days when I am still
hopelessly poor

stay out of trouble stay in touch
try not to think about me too much
stay out of trouble stay in touch
try not to think about me too much"
Never Grow Up,"5,192",Taylor Swift,"Your little hands wrapped
around my finger And it's
so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter
cause you're dreaming So I
tuck you in and turn on
your favorite night light
To you everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Never grow up

You're in the car
on the way to the movies And you're
mortified your mama's
dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much
you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don't make
her drop you off around the block
Remember she's getting older too
And don't
lose the way that you dance
around in your PJs
getting ready for school
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
No one's ever burned
Nothing's ever left you scarred
Even though you want to
just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of
your childhood room
Memorize what is sounded like
what your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps
remember the words said
And all your little brother's
favorite songs
I just realized everything
I had is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city
they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I
thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and
turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up

I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heat
And even throuhg toyu want to
please try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up

Just never grow up"

I'd Love You to Want Me,954,Lobo,"When I saw you standing there
I 'bout fell out my chair
And when you moved
your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet
Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be
You told yourself years ago
You'd never let your feelings show
The obligation that you've made
For the title that they gave
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be

Catholic Country (Feat. Feist),921,Kings Of Convenience,"It's one o'clock in the morning
And we're in an apartment
In the capital city
In a Catholic country
Got my back on the carpet
And my feet to the ceiling
To get the blood flowing
To numb the pain I'm feeling
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
Yesterday she took me
To a wintery garden
Past a forest of consciеnce
On a curvy road
With every hour of passing
I startеd to believe in
The bubble I've been dreaming
Had a floor on the ceiling
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I want you
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I want you
Ah-ah
To be with someone so precious
That it makes me anxious
To be there by the target
And know that I could miss it
I never felt so lonely
As when you came and saw me
And the following moment
Took your eyes off me
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you"

Layla (Album Version),"1,198",Eric Clapton,"What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running
and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease
my worried mind.
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
Turned my whole world upside down.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease
my worried mind.
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane.
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease
my worried mind.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease
my worried mind."
Give Me Love,"6,801",Ed Sheeran,"Give me love like her
cause lately
I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops
on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns
into alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me
or burn this out
We'll play hide and
seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste
that your lips allow

I've been craving more
And it's been a while
but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know
I'll fight my corner
And that tonight
I'll call ya
After my blood is
drowning in alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me
or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek

Of all the money
that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm
that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for
want of width
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy
be with you all
Of all the comrades
that ever I had
They are sorry for
my going away
And all the sweethearts
that ever I had
They would wish me one
more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and
you should not
I'll gently rise and
I'll softly call
Good night and joy be
with you all
A man may drink
and not be drunk
A man may fight
and not be slain
A man may court
a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed
back again
But since it has
so ordered been
By a time to rise
and a time to fall
Come fill to me
the parting glass
Good night and
joy be with you all
Good night and
joy be with you all"
Made For You,"2,511",Alexander Cardinale,"Never did believe
In what I couldn't see
Long before I knew
Darling I was made for you

Gave us time to talk about
The things that we could do
Darling I was made for you
Oh I was made for you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Darling I was made for you
Any other guy
That made you say goodbye
Must've been a fool
But darling I was made for you
There's not much that I know
Been searching high and low
The one thing that is true
Darling I was made for you
Oh I was made for you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Darling I was made for you
With your smile illuminating
Save my heart that needed saving
No way I could be mistaken

As I walked as I walked
A lonely road a lonely road

A little voice
Up in the trees
And she sang a little song
She said Why don’t you sing along
Life’s too short to sing it on your own

On the subway on the subway
As I hung as I hung
My head down low

And he sang a little song
He said Why don’t you sing along

So we’ll fall in love
with the sun and the stars
And we’ll break away from the rain

We don’t need anyone to be free
So we’ll drive away

Angel Of The Morning,801,Juice Newton,"There'll be no strings to
bind your hands
Not if my love
can find your heart

there's no need to
take a stand
For it was
I who chose to start

I see no need to
take me home
I'm old enough
to face the dawn
Just call me
angel of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me
angel of the morning angel
Then slowly turn away
from me
Maybe the sun's light
will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says
we've sinned
Well it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims
of the night
I won't be blinded
by the night
Just call me
angel of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me
angel of the morning angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay
with me
through the tears
of the day
of the years baby
Just call me angel
of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me
angel of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling
Just call me
angel of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling"

Bird,"3,089",Billie Marten,"She’s underwater again
Somebody’s daughter a friend
In the night in the dark in the cold
As she walks far away
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
I don’t mind
Hope is a distance Unreached
Ink on her skin incomplete
And the faint sound of friends
As she neared to the end
she had peace
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
I don’t mind I don’t mind
Where does her start go from here
Lost In the grip
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
I don’t mind I don’t mind
I don’t mind I don’t mind"
I Don't Want to Change You,"5,890",Damien Rice,"Wherever you are
Well know that I adore you
No matter how far
Well I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
I know that I am willing
Oh and I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a strangers' eyes
Wherever you go
Well I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If it's a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well I can wait without waiting
And if you want me to let this go
Well I am more than willing
O 'cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye
O and I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye
I've never been with anyone
In the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then it's doomed 'cause
Water races
Water races down the waterfall
The water races
Water races down the waterfall
And I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Where there is no danger
Where love has eyes and is not
blind"

Sarah's Place (feat. Noah Kahan),26,Zach Bryan,"Road dogs are built for sleepin' in
I've been up since 4 am
At your worst, you're better than my better days
There ain't been no sun in LA
Since you moved out of Sarah's place

I love your mother's stories 'bout you as a kid
I heard you scored a job in the east village
While working for some folks who don't know your name
Well, ain't you gonna miss all of them wasted days?
We'd sit around, drinkin' out at Sarah's place

Don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

And you called to talk just last week
I'm still fallin' apart like I'll always be
And your picnic chair is still sittin' there in the yard
And I had to sell my old guitar

But don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

You'll always be a piece of mine, a piece of mine
We drove that road we know at least a million times
I'm so damn tired of seeing that empty drive
Out at Sarah's Place

Don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

Oh ah, hey
Mmm, mmm

Plane tickets have gotten awfully expensive
But I got mine for the price of a Gibson"
Greenfields,55,The Brothers Four,"Once there were green fields
Kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys
Where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies
With white clouds high above
Once there were part of
An everlasting love
We were the lovers who strolled
Through green fields
Green fields are gone now
Parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys
Where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind
That swept into my heart
Gone with the lovers
Who let their dreams depart
Where are the green fields
That we used to roam

I'll never know
What made you run away
How can I keep searching
When dark clouds hide the day
I only know
There's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world
Left for me to see
But I'll keep on waiting
Till you return
I'll keep on waiting
Until the day you learn
You can't be happy
While your hearts on the roam
You can't be happy
Until you bring it home
Home to the green fields and me
Once again"
Falling Slowly,"12,936",Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova,"I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react
And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat
and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful
voice you have a choice
You've make it now
Falling slowly
eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me
and erase me
And I'm painted black
You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat
and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful
voice you had a choice
You've made it now
Falling slowly
sing your melody
I'll sing along"
Rhinestone Cowboy,97,Glen Campbell,"Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy





I've been walking these streets so long

Singing the same old song

I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway

Where hustle is the name of the game

And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain

There's been a load of compromising

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me



후렴 : Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy

Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers coming over the phone



Well I really don't mind the rain

And a smile can hide all the pain

But you're down when you're riding a train

That's taking the long way

And I dream of the thing I'll do

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There's been a load of compromising

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me"
A Cup of Coffee,"3,431",Julian Moon,"Woah slow down
Take it easy
There's a long line behind you
Lower your voice please
I know it's my job to make it
the way you want it
Like a raspberry mocha
Or a caffe macchiato
Or a non-fat one-pump latte
with two added shots of espresso
Relax and put it in perspective
I mean really
It's just a fucking cup of coffee lady
Is it really gonna break your day
If it's not exactly your way
It's just a fucking cup of coffee lady
Get another one for free
but don't take it out on me
It's just a fucking cup of coffee
Hey OK
I get you're really pissed
But you're overreacting
Being ridiculous
Said a little too much of this
Or not quite enough of that
Is it too hot to sip it
Is it not non-fat
Did your house burn down
Did your dog die
Did you catch your husband in the act
Come on it's not the end of the world
I mean really
It's just a fucking cup of coffee lady
Is it really gonna break your day
If it's not exactly your way
It's just a fucking cup of coffee lady
Get another one for free
but don't take it out on me
It's just a fucking cup of coffee
I wish I could punch you in the face
But I can't
I wish I could stand up
on this counter and rant
But I can't
Instead I have to say
Have a nice day
But by the way
It's just a fucking
cup of coffee lady
Is it really gonna break your day
If it's not exactly your way
It's just a fucking
cup of coffee lady
Get another one for free
but don't take it out on me
It's just a fucking cup of coffee
Oh it's just a fucking cup of coffee"
Today Was A Fairytale,"2,059",Taylor Swift,"Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damse l in distress
You took me by the hand
and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t shirt
You told me I was pretty when I
looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
whenever you're around

But can you feel this
magic in the air
It must have been the
way you kissed me
Fell in love when I
saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
that takes me to another planet
Every move you make
everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is
it's now getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time
I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
whenever you're around
Yeah
But can you feel this
magic in the air
It must have been the
way you kissed me
Fell in love when
I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it
I can't put this down

But can you feel this
magic in the air
It must have been the
way you kissed me
Fell in love when I
saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this
magic in the air
It must have been the

Rebound,"2,371",Julian Moon,"So you are out of a relationship
But no you are not over her yet
And no matter how
many times you begged
She moved on
So you lean a little closer to me
compliment and call me cutie
Yes I know you only want me
to prove your low self esteem wrong
Hey don't be sorry
that you don't care
That you'll never love me
Well I'm quite aware
I'm just a rebound
We're gonna get down
So you can forget
I'm just a rebound
Stop calling me your girlfriend
Stop Stop Stop
I'm not your one true love
the stars above
Or the perfect girl
you are dreaming of
I know I'm never gonna mean
that much to you
And it's really getting
on my nerves
when you say
you never mention her
like I don't know
you enough to see the real truth
That you are not sorry
that you don't care
That you'll never love me
Well I'm quite aware
I'm just a rebound
We're gonna get down
So you can forget
I'm just a rebound
Stop calling me your girlfriend
Sure I've liked you
since we first met
Sure I'd like to be more than this
But I am not her
And yeah that hurts
But don't check in or take me out
Don't buy me things
or snuggle after
when you are all after
is still cool with me
I'll be your rebound
We're gonna get down
So you can forget
I'm just a rebound
Stop calling me your girlfriend
I'm just a rebound
I'm just a rebound
I'm just a rebound
Stop calling me your girlfriend"
Holiday Party,569,Dan + Shay,"There’s a chill blowin’ in the air
Pretty white lights everywhere
Strip malls and parking
lots are packin’ out
Weatherman sayin’ it might snow
Might as well keep off the road
So whatcha say
we stay here at the house
Me and you
We’ll throw a holiday party
Don’t tell anybody
We’ll pour us a drink and
hang some lights on the tree
We’ll be jingle bell rockin’
Til the neighbors come knockin’
So turn up the fire playin’ on the TV
Watchin’ for Santa
from the top of the roof
While we’re wrapped up
in a blanket for two
We’ll throw a holiday party
Holiday party
For just me and you
We can say that we’re not in town
When our friends say meet us out
We’ll just keep hangin’
like the mistletoe
And we’ll sing karaoke
Slip on somethin’ cozy
Cuz we ain’t got nowhere to go
We’ll throw a holiday party
Don’t tell anybody
We’ll pour us a drink and
hang some lights on the tree
We’ll be jingle bell rockin’
Til the neighbors come knockin’
So turn up the fire playin’ on the TV
Watchin’ for Santa
from the top of the roof
While we’re wrapped up
in a blanket for two
We’ll throw a holiday party
Holiday party
For just me and you
And when New Year’s
Eve rolls around
We ain’t gotta shut it down
We’ll throw a holiday party
Don’t tell anybody
We’ll pour us a drink
and hang some lights on the tree
We’ll be jingle bell rockin’
Til the neighbors come knockin’
So turn up the fire playin’ on the TV
Watchin’ for Santa
from the top of the roof
While we’re wrapped up
in a blanket for two
We’ll throw a holiday party
Holiday party
For just me and you"
First Light,390,BROWN & GRAY,"Summer love turnin' cold
Packed a bag hit the road
Another town full of faces
I don't know
Spent a year runnin' circles
Trippin' on every hurdle
Fallin' down learnin'
how to let it go
Got a bottle full of therapy
Gettin' used to no company
Wasn't lookin' for anything
Wasn't lookin' for anything ayy
Went out I was drunk and lonely
Told myself it was one night only
Wasn't proud of the way
you found me
Dancin' with my broken heart
Didn't care
where the time was goin'
'Fore we knew it
the bar was closin'
The hell'd you do to me
last night
I'm wakin' up in love
at first light
Ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh
Wakin' up in love at first light
Small town I was feelin' stuck
Same cowboy different truck
I tried 'em on
now I'm all out of luck
We all know how it is
Settle down have some kids
Good for them but for me

Got a bottle full of therapy
Gettin' used to no company
Wasn't lookin' for anything
Wasn't lookin' for anything ayy
Went out I was drunk and lonely
Told myself it was one night only
Wasn't proud of the way

Dancin' with my broken heart
Didn't care

Fast Car,"2,712",Tracy Chapman,"You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
But me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working
at the convenience store
Managed to save just
a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border
and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it
means to be living

You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle
that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too
young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from
life than he could give
I said somebody's
got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's
what I did

You got a fast car
But is it fast enough
so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die
this way

I remember we were driving driving
in your car
The speed so fast I felt like
I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
be someone be someone

You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain
ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market
as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house
and live in the suburbs

I remember we were
driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like
I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling
that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
be someone be someone

You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays
all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends
than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together
you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and
keep on driving

I remember we were driving driving
in your car
The speed so fast
I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling
I could be someone
be someone be someone

You got a fast car
But is it fast enough
so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight
or live and die this way"
Fast Girl,"2,070",Seth Ennis,"We took it slow
met you one night
and three days later
I called and said hello
And up at 4AM

on the phone
And on the first date
you wanted to wait for the first kiss
when I took you home
Yeah we took it slow
But you got over me
fast girl fast girl
That ain't that girl that girl
That I thought I knew

To just walk away one day
next day
On to another dude
You're doing things
I thought you'd never do
Like a fast girl
You got over me fast girl fast girl
But I thought you liked
slow dancing to slow jams
And holding hands was romance
enough for you
But when I leaned
in slow to taste your lips
there was no slowing
down my fingertips
If we were like wine then
that whole night
was just one slow sip
But you got over me
fast girl fast girl
That ain't that girl that girl
That I thought I knew
no it ain't like you
To just walk away one day next day
On to another dude
You're doing things

You got over me fast girl fast girl
You're tryna make me jealous
Tryna find a new me
Well that's real cute
But all that it's gonna
do is help get me getting over you

Delight,822,Avenue Beat,"Do you know
how much it took for me
To tell you that
I think you're fine as hell
And do you wanna

I got this coupon to taco bell
You say you can't right now and

You finally let it out

That's when they love to
wreck my self-esteem
Ask me why I never bring a date

covered everything
Say I need a real job
I tell them all please
I get to sing my songs
and everybody thinks
I'm a freakin' delight

Somewhere in Ann Arbor,668,Anson Seabra,"Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's a broken traffic light
Blinking softly
for an audience of one
A boy who takes his comfort
in the shelter of the night
And stays up until the morning
just because
Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's an empty parking lot
Where he likes to go and
look up at the moon
Ask himself where things went
wrong and why he feels so caught
And hopes that things start
changing someday soon
Oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start
feeling like he should
Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's a table set for two
Where he'd like to find
some company to share
Spends the evening spilling
his whole life to someone new
Perfect smile and ribbon
in her hair
Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's a vacant hotel room
where he leaves
all of his lovers high and dry
Pretends he's got the thing
they want and
when he has them fooled
He crumbles and
escapes into the night
Oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start
feeling like he should
Oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start
feeling like he should
And oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start

So Bad,"1,256",Alexander Jean,"I've been reckless in my own mind
Staying up night after night
What is the point of sleeping

Feeling like royalty
Running like a machine

from you darling
But a little bit ain't ever
been enough

keep it coming
And I guess I'm a lot fucked up

I've it the bottom

you don't need to know
You don't need to know about that
You are so bad for me
You are so bad so bad
And I need you desperately
You are so bad so bad
I've been drinking you
like champagne
Pulling you into my veins
What is the point of sleeping
wide awake
Losing track of the days
Stumbling through these miles
Oh when I really should be sleeping
I just need a little bit of help
from you darling
from you darling
Cause I'm faling out than I ever fell
Leaving me with nothing
give me something
And you're fucking on my mental
health and it's a problem
And I've got a lot of 'em

Pretty Little Poison,35,Warren Zeiders,"Every night around about this time
It’s like she knows I’m lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leaning on old memories
And talking ‘bout what used to be
She’ll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain’t sweet

She’s my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah she came with a warning
But I didn’t mind
I’ll go out on that high every time
She’s my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

Shadows dancin’ down the hall
Whispers that she wants me
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind of fix
For me, she’s the one I pick
Nothing else will do the trick
She’s all I need

She’s my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah she came with a warning
But I didn’t mind
I’ll go out on that high every time
She’s my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

For some I guess it’s alcohol
But I don’t want none at all
I just want you
No, I just want you

My pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah she came with a warning
But I didn’t mind
I’ll go out on that high every time
She’s my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

She’s my pretty little poison"

April Come She Will (SBS 드라마 '엔젤 아이즈' 삽입곡),957,Simon & Garfunkel,"April come she will
When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June she'll change her tune
In restless walks
she'll prowl the night
July she will fly
And give no warning
to her flight
August die she must
The autumn winds blow
chilly and cold
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old"
Small Bump,"2,100",Ed Sheeran,"You're just a small bump
unborn in four months
You're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands
be as gentle as I can
But for now your scan of
my unmade plans
A small bump in four months
You're brought to life
I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing
But truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of
a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed
to be soon opened wide
A small bump in four months
You'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing
But truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You were just a small bump unborn
for four months
then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"

Starlight,"1,335",Taylor Swift,"I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
never would forget
how we moved
The whole place
was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk
summer of '45
Picked me up
late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy
running wild wild
Can't remember what song
it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck
into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess
and a prince
And I said
Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
never would forget
how we moved
The whole place
was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
starlight
Like we're made of starlight

He said Look at you
Worrying so much about
things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life
singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks
on the ocean saying to me
Don't you see the
starlight starlight
Don't you dream
impossible things
Like Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
never would forget how we moved
The whole place
was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight

Like we're made of starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and
teach 'em how to dream

He didn't like it
when I wore high heels but I do
Turn the lock and
put my headphones on
He always said he
didn't get this song but I do I do
Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early
and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out
and help me in
And you don't know
how nice that is but I do
And you throw your head
back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think
I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending
the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
You said you never
met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor
records as you but I do
We tell stories and
you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy but I do
But you throw your head
back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that
you think I'm funny
'cause he never did
I've been spending
the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
And we walked down
the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies
that your family watches
Every single Christmas
and I will talk about that
And for the first time
what's past is past
'Cause you threw your head
back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that
you think I'm funny
'cause he never did
I've been spending
the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is
break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again"
Valhalla Calling,69,Peyton Parrish,"Ships on vigor of the waves are skimming
Barren summits to the verdant plains
Each horizon is a new beginning
Rise and reign
Far from the fjords and the ice cold currents
Ravens soar over new frontiers
Songs and sagas of a fate determined
Shields and spears
Vows of favour or the thrill of plunder
Pull together for the clan and kin
Clank of hammers and the crash of thunder
Pound within
Oh-ho-oh
The echoes of eternity
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla calling me
Oh-ho-oh
To pluck the strings of destiny
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla calling me
Valhalla calling me
Sails a swaying on the crimson rivers
Blood and glory in the fighting fields
Shields a' shatter into splintered timbers
Iron and steel
Fires are rising and the bells are ringing
Glory, take us into Odin's halls
Golden glimmer and the sound of singing
Asgards call
Oh-ho-oh
The echoes of eternity
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla calling me
Oh-ho-oh
To pluck the strings of destiny
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla calling me
Valhalla calling me
Wind and the waves will carry me
Wind and the waves will set me free
Wind and the waves will carry me
Wind and the waves will set me free
Oh-ho-oh
The echoes of eternity
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla calling me
Oh-ho-oh
To pluck the strings of destiny
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla calling me
Valhalla calling me"
24,54,NIKI,"What do you know?
Suddenly you're older now
They call you a grown up, with the dog and the bills
And the garden, and the picturesque house

And the pear tree is budding up a third year
And if your mother were still here
The fallen blossoms on the lawn would all disappear

And you're in love, you pray to God it's forever
But you look around, and think why try altogether?
But he's endless, and on my skin like sand on the shore
And that's enough for me right now anyway at 24

You travel the world, swim under a waterfall
You have everything you ever wanted
You wonder when your dad will call

And you're in New York again
With your oldest friend
And the basket of bread's still warm
And that's enough for me right now anyway at 24

Oh, I know more than I ever have
And yet I know nothing at all
I'm a floating feather, I'm a constant cannonball
I'm somebody's baby, someone else's midnight call
I know more than I ever have
And yet nothing at all

Well, what do you know?
Suddenly you're 24"

Know How (Feat. Feist),"2,383",Kings Of Convenience,"Riding on this know how
Never been here before
Peculiarly entrusted
Possibly that's all
Is history recorded
Does someone have a tape
Surely I'm no pioneer
Constellations stay the same
Just a little bit of danger
When intriguingly
Our little secret
Trusts that you trust me
'Cause no one will ever know
That this was happening
So tell me why you listen
When nobody's talking

All this is what it is

Those Dancing Days Are Gone,"1,659",Carla Bruni,"Come let me sing into your ear
Those dancing days are gone
All the silk and satin gear
Crouch upon a stone
Wrapping that foul body up
In as foul a rag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
Curse as you may I sing it through
What matter if the knave
That the most could pleasure you
The children that he gave
Are somewhere sleeping like a top
Under a marble flag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
Come let me sing into your ear
I thought it out this very day
Noon upon the clock
All that silk and satin gear
A man may put pretense away
Who leans upon a stick
May sing and sing until he drop
Whether to maid or hag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
Come let me sing into your ear
Those dancing days are gone
All that silk and satin gear
Crouch upon a stone
Wrapping that foul body up
In as foul a rag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag"
Beautiful You,625,Jennifer Waescher,"Beautiful you Beautiful you
Beautiful you Beautiful you
Beautiful you
You walk around
in your profound ways
Taking a little more each day
And you’re seeing things
as they are
And they’re not so far from here
And you’re seeing things
as they’ll be
They’re not so different
from your dreams
But you’re ripping apart
at the seams and leaking out
Realizing all your crimes
and hidden doubts
Were there all along
There all along
There all along
There all along
And how do you get by sometimes
In the night
when you’re all alone
And thinking is suffocating
And just too much
It’s just too much
It’s just too much
It’s just too much
The days are flying by
And it’s coming down to this
It’s coming down to this
The years are flying by
And it’s coming down to this
It’s coming down to this
No matter what you do
It’s coming down to this
There’s no need to cry
It’s coming down
to this To this
And all you really need to know
You know it
You know it
So you know what love is
And that it never dies
Even with hate
And all that counts is
you’re still standing
And your heart’s still beating
After all these years
And you’re finally seeing
What’s been there all along
There all along
There all along
There all along
And don’t you know
it’s up to you
To mend your broken heart
You’re still finding a way
You’re still finding your way
We’re all just finding our way

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I know I'm meant
To be with you
You
Love is not enough
Why can't love just be enough
Right when it's good
time it messes it up
Please don't let me go
When we come and go
Distance can help hearts to grow
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I know I'm meant
To be with you
You
Days are getting longer
The nights are feeling colder
When we are not together
I'm falling apart
'Cause all I want is you
And all I need is you
Baby you may be somewhere
else too far from me
Come home soon

once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are
far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you will find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Oh why oh why can't I

The Boxer,469,Simon & Garfunkel,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles
such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears
what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low seeking out
the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know
Lie la lie lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie lie la la la la lie la la lie
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come on from the whores

I do declare
There were times
when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort
there le le le le le le le
Lie la lie lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie lie la la la la lie la la lie
Then I'm laying out
my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

Speak Now,"10,671",Taylor Swift,"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging
in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying
the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she
is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped
like a pastry
This is surely not
what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
where I stand and say
Don't say yes run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
and they said speak now

Fun gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to
play a song that sounds
like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
you wish it was me
Don't you
Don't say yes run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
and they said speak now
Don't say yes run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
and they said speak now

I hear the preacher say
speak now or forever
hold your peace
There's the silence
there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands
all eyes on me
Horrified looks from
everyone in the room But
I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging
in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying
the wrong girl
Don't say yes run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
said speak now
And you say
lets run away now
I'll meet when I'm out
of my tux at the backdoor
Baby I didn't say my vows
so glad you were around
When they said Speak now"
Simple As It Should Be,437,Tristan Prettyman,"Put your hands to my hands
Put your knees to my knees
Put your eyes to my eyes
Come on baby compliment me
'Cause I don't think that we
Should ever feel the need to worry
Ever get ourselves in a hurry
You know I love you
I know you love me
So time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
And this love will build
Through flights and streets
In the end I predict
You'll get the very best of me
So put your lips to my lips
Why not go on and take all of it
And just run as fast as you can
Just 'cause you can
'Cause time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
I am almost 23
Confused with all the lines
in between
They are dying to be read
Softly spoken simply said
Tell me do you believe
In the girl that is me
With her feet to your feet
Well that's all that I need
'Cause time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be

Without no seams
nor needless work
Then she'll be

Between the salt water
and the sea strand
Then she'll be

Tell her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
Parsley sage rosemary

And gather it all

There was a day
when I just had to tell
my point of view
I was like you
Now I don't mean
to make you frown
No I just want you to slow down
Have you never been mellow
Have you never tried to find
a comfort from inside you
Have you never been happy
just to hear your song
Have you never
let someone else be strong
Running around as you do
with your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back
kick your shoes off close your eyes
I was like you
Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone
to hold your hand
Have you never been mellow
Have you never tried to find
a comfort from inside you
Have you never been happy
just to hear your song
Have you never let
someone else be strong"

life is only getting faster

Chateau,"3,320",Angus & Julia Stone,"I don't mind
if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
I can go if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance in the hotel room
We can run with dead lights on
'til we got nothing to lose
We have lifting from the ground
We go ever coming down

I'll take you there
Everyday the weekend
I'm tryna be your best friend
Trying just to figure it out
Go on and let your gun burst
Living on the outskirts
Trying just to figure it out
Talking like a deadbeat
I just wanted you to see
Everything that I could see
Walking in the night sky
I'm always on your side
You were really saving me
We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance in the hotel room
We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance like
we got nothing to lose

Forever After All,"1,176",Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got 12 ounces
A good truck's got maybe
three hundred thousand
You only get so much
until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a 45
Are the kinda things that
only last so long
When the new wears off
and they get to getting old
Sooner or later
time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight
dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that
I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man
have second thoughts
Maybe some things
last forever after all
FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like
I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna
break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off
and they get to getting old
Yeah sooner or later
time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight
dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that
I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man
have second thoughts
Maybe some things
last forever after all
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight
dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord
calls one of us home and
One won't have the other
by their side
But heaven knows that
that won't last too long
Maybe some things
last forever after all
After all"

Freedom,359,Jordan Hart,"I want to hold your eyes
Keep my heart on the tables
Sometimes what’s in my mind
doesn’t show on my face though
I want to fortify
without fossilizing
Redefine all the people I’ve been
Breathe inside each moment I’m in
And walk into a new horizon
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
Wish that I could feel the sun
without casting a shadow
Does sleeping in a soft bed
dampen my halo
I’ve made plans
takes time to change though
Or is that just words to say
Don’t heroes stand
outside the fables
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I just want to stay in the now
In the now
Never want to stray from the now
From the now
I just want to stay in the now
Never want to stray from the now
Screen to a page in the now
I lost my way from the now
Then I saw your face in the now
And you’ve got a way with the now
So take my hand
and take me to the now
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m trying to find my freedom
Freedom"
State Of Grace,898,Taylor Swift,"I'm walking fast
through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone
with our changing minds
We fall in love
'til it hurts or bleeds
or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
You come around
and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room
and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never never
saw you coming
And I’ll never never
be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
of something good
And right and real
And I never never saw you coming
And I’ll never never
be the same
And I never never saw you coming
And I’ll never
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
Be the same
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"
Do What You Wanna Do,728,Mocca,"Take it easy my friend
Grab the chance will you can

Cause the sour will come down
Just be true to yourself
Everything will be alright
Take it easy my friend
Wipe the tears from your eyes
There's a magic
in the air tonight
High in the light of your sky
Do what you wanna do
Do what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say

The River In The Pines,694,Joan Baez,"Oh Mary was a maiden
When the birds began to sing
She was sweeter
than the blooming rose
So early in the spring
Her thoughts were gay and happy
And the morning gay and fine
For her lover was a river boy
From the river in the pines
Now Charlie he got married
To his Mary in the spring
When the trees were budding early
And the birds began to sing
But early in the autumn
When the fruit is in the wine
I'll return to you my darling
From the river in the pines
It was early in the morning
In Wisconsin''s dreary clime
When he rode the fatal rapids
For that last and fatal time
They found his body lying
On the Rocky shore below
Where the silent water ripples
And the whispering cedars blow
Now every raft of lumber
that comes down the cheerful way
There's a lonely grave that's
visited by drivers on their way
They plant the wild flowers upon it
In the morning fair and fine
'Tis the grave of two young lovers
From the river in the pines"
Golden Hour,704,Kacey Musgraves,"All that I know is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time with you

Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour, the color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I used to get sad and lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found in you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour, the color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes, it looks like paradise

[Chorus]
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour, the color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

A Window/O'Keeffe,81,Emmy The Great,"Love is an obsession that lives in my phone
When I let it die I know I'm alone
My real life begins like a crack giving off some light

That feeling when you both dress up as monks
Orange and red, so we might burn the sun
I say ""Georgia O'Keeffe"" and you show me your teeth, all white

And they we walk through everybody's videos
And when we finally stop we're underneath a window
And someone's playing music
Someone's watching over us
And something 'bout this music reminds me of what has just gone past
That was today

Art is the way that we frame what we see
But these days I crave anonymity
If you get that fame, don't you give it to me
Just give me what you say

And in these dying days of summertime
I think I know exactly what I

'Cause someone's playing music
Someone's watching over us
And something 'bout this music reminds me of what has just gone past
That was today

'Cause someone's playing music
Someone's watching over us
And something 'bout this music reminds me of what has just gone past
That was today"
The Sun Is In Your Eyes (Voice Memo),599,Jacob Collier,"The sun is in your eyes
The sun is in your eyes
Throw me the cold
Throw me the cold
cold water of your smile again
To take me by surprise
You take me by surprise
Throw me the bold
Throw me the bold
bold treasure of your lips again
And where I go
You lead me in the right direction
And with your love as my protection
I'll be a world of your projection
And where I go
Singing songs of your affection
With rhymes to your perfection
In my eyes see a reflection
Of you
I see you clearly now
I hold you dearly now
The sun is in my eyes"

When I compliment her
she won’t believe me

Sad to think that

But every time she asks me,
“Do I look okay?”
I say
When I see your face
There’s not a thing that
I would change
‘Cause you’re amazing

And when you smile
The whole world stops

Oh, you know, you know
You know I’d never ask you to change
If perfect’s what you’re
searching for then just stay the same
So don’t even bother asking

Starlight (Taylor's Version),909,Taylor Swift,"I said
oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk
summer of '45
Picked me up late one night
Out the window we were seventeen
And crazy running wild wild
Can't remembеr what song
it was playing when we walked in
Thе night we snuck into a
Yacht club party pretending to
Be a duchess and a prince
And I said oh my
what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
starlight
Like we're made of starlight
starlight
He said Look at you
Worrying too much about things
you can't change
You'll spend your whole life
singing the blues
if you keep thinking that way
He was trying
to skip rocks on the ocean
saying to me
Don't you see the starlight
starlight
Don't you dream impossible
things
Like oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
starlight
Like we're made of starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them
how to dream
Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved

Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing

"Home (From ""Frozen 2""/Outtake)","4,873",Kristen Bell,"I smell that salty breeze
blowing through the fjord
I hear those creaky ships
as old board meets old board
I breathe in the place
I live and wonder what else
can I give this home
My home
Wandering through the town
with everyone doing
all of their stuff
Somewhere in my heart
I feel I've not yet done enough
For these people I know
this place that I love so
My home
My home
I whistle as I walk
a lovely smell of kransekake
Wafting out of the baker’s door
The merchants haggling
over fish remind me
I have what I wish
'Cause I'm not alone anymore
I’m grateful for this castle
And for everything we've got
Especially my family
We've all been through a lot
I know how fragile things can be
If I lost them I'd lose me
They're my ocean they're my shore
I wanna give them more
They're my home
My home
Bless this happiness we found
Bless this good and solid ground
Our home
Our home
Our home
Our home
Our home

Our home

Long Live,"2,245",Taylor Swift,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our
shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced
like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls
we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that
we stood there
On the side lines
wishing for right now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your
baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we help them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming this is absurd
Cause for a moment a
band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to
rule the world
Long live the walls
we crashed through
How the kingdom lights
shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the
mountains we moved
I had the time of
my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long
live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on
Just spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Can you take a moment
promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate
should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds
went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls
we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we
crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing long live all
the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
Long long live the
look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered"
First Of The Gang (Album Version),551,Zee Avi,"You have never been in love
Until you've seen the stars
reflect in the resevoirs
And you have never been in love
Until you've seen the dawn rise
behind the home for the blind
We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our street
where Hector
was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die Oh my
Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die Oh my
You have never been in love
Until you've seen
the sunlight thrown
over smashed human bones
We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our street
where Hector
was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy
Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and a bullet in his gullet
and the first lost lad to go
under the sod
And he stole from
the rich and the poor
and the not-very-rich
and the very poor
and he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away
he stole all hearts away"
Deserve To Be,"1,604",David Choi,"I don't know where to start
I don't want to say it
Cause I know
I'll break your heart
You know I can't love you
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be
I searched near and far
Got my waist in too deep
Did I have to try so hard
Just to find out what it means
I didn't want to hurt you
But it isn't what it seems
You deserve better than me
You're a kind kind soul
For being patient with my
Cold cold heart
But in time I know
You'll find a good good heart
I don't know where to start
I don't want to say it and
I don't want to break your heart
I just can't love you
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be"
Sparks Fly,"2,601",Taylor Swift,"The way you move is like a
full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the
kind of reckless that should
send me running
But I kinda know that I
won't get far
And you stood there
in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you
couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause' I see sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll
haunt me
when you're not around
Cause I see sparks fly
whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's
really something
You find I'm even better
than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the
rest of the world
But with you
I know it's no good
And I could wait
patiently but
I really wish you would
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt
me when you're not around
Cause I see sparks fly
whenever you smile

I run my fingers through
your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your
eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make it
feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me
when you're
not around
Cause I see sparks fly
whenever you smile"
Winter Came And Went,310,Son Of Caesar,"When I was born

I saw a rainbow

up in the sky



When I was born

I saw a scarecrow

alone in the light



When I was born

I was just child

When I was born

I heard my mother cry



When I was born

She was my friend

She was my friend

She was my friend



When I was young

I saw a rainbow

up in the sky



When I was young

I was a scapegoat

coat in the light



When I was young

I was afraid to die

When I was young

I heard my mother cry



When I was young

She was my friend

She was my friend

She was my friend



Winter came and went

She was still my friend

Even though she have to go

in the end



Now that I'm here

She is a rainbow

up in the sky



Now that i'm here

she is a raincoat

keepin' me dry



Now that I'm here

I don't want to die

Now that I'm here

You never see me cry



Now that I'm here

She is my friend

She is my friend

She is my friend"
Rain Clouds,449,Alvin Ordonez,"I guess I'll take my time yeah
I'll take it slow
Don't want to lose
track of my steps
I think I made it too
far to lose control
And as her voice replays
inside my head
I heard my heartbeat
scream her name
We could try to recreate the art
but it'll never ever be the same
Why are these rain clouds
over my head
Can someone call the weatherman
tell him make it sunny
instead 'cause
I've been thinking
I've been wishing
I've been wondering
Oh I've been waiting for you
to come home it's about that time
So I could reintroduce
your pretty eyes to mine
'Cause baby I've been missing
your beautiful eyes
beautiful eyes
I don't understand love
baby I don't know
I try to sound it out
but the words don't go
And the lines just stay behind
'Til we press rewind and we
play it back again
So I made amends
so I can just pretend
That maybe someday
someday in the end
I will find my hands
wrapped in yours
But for now I'll ask myself
I'll ask myself
Why are these rain clouds
over my head
Can someone call the
weatherman tell him make it
sunny instead 'cause
I've been thinking
I've been wishing
I've been wondering
Oh I've been waiting for you
to come home it's about that time
So I could reintroduce
your pretty eyes to mine
'Cause baby I've been
missing your beautiful eyes
Baby I know this feeling
a little more than I intend
Can I see you just one more time
before you tell me
we're just friends
'Cause I was told
there were better things
But why were you in my dreams
Picture perfect as it seems
Why are these rain clouds
over my head
Can someone call the
weatherman tell him make it
sunny instead 'cause
I've been thinking
I've been wishing
I've been wondering
Oh I've been waiting for you
to come home it's about that time
So I could reintroduce

Nice Ones,286,Jetty Rae,"Behind their smiles
Are tiny little crocodiles
Waiting to do do do me in
Beware of those
Who only can speak so sweet
Their words are like honey true
Dripping with bees
Your words are like
Windows without any screens
I will fall fall fall to my death
No one will ever hear me scream
Your kindness is obscene
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh
Everything can't always be
As nice as you'd like to believe
We're not all actors here
And this is not your TV screen
So why am I forced to stand
Behind this green screen
And pretend that I do not see
The monster coming for me
I know that sounds so silly
so silly so crazy of me
But my imagination can't help
But make you a little more scary
Than you ought to be
than you ought to be to me
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh
I have known lots of people
like you in my life
I say good grief to you all I
don't like any sugar with my spice
Oh I'm so gracious
more than I really should be
More gracious than any body's
ever been to me
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh
Never trust the nice ones ohhhhh"

Birds and Daisies,408,Racoon Racoon,"The birds fly south
as the light leaves your eyes
Hold on to your dream
Oh, I know you wanna scream
Since the day you're born,
you're just a flower on your own
Waiting for the sun to blossom
Hoping to break through the storm
Winter winds slightly
touching your soft skin
There's gotta be a brighter day
A summer breeze,
some silk and honey
A big white horse is running
through the golden doors
You know you gotta take the ride
It's now or never by my side
Little Daisy, don't be shy
Nobody changes, they just lie
Take your own fate by the hand
It's time to conquer your own land
Little Daisy, don't be shy
Nobody changes, they just lie
Take your own fate by the hand
It's time to conquer your own land"
Better Man (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),850,Taylor Swift,"I know I'm probably better off
on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know
what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage
you did to me
Never again I just wish I could forget
when it was magic
I wish it wasn't 4AM
standing in the mirror
Saying to myself
you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing
I ever did was run
Sometimes in the middle of the night
I can feel you again
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man
who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy
oh I can hear it now
Talking down to me like
I'd always be around
Push my love away like
it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh you never thought I'd run
Sometimes in the middle of the night
I can feel you again
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I hold onto this pride
because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and
we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah yeah
Sometimes in the middle of the night
I can feel you again
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Sometimes in the middle of the night
I can feel you again
We might still be in love
if you were a better man

And they know that I'm from down south

Took a little for the train to leave the station

I Won't Let Go,288,Rascal Flatts,"It's like a storm

I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
If you can't cope

Fall into You (Feat. Ebba),191,Houses On The Hill,"Hey, I wish you could see yourself, just sitting there on my chair

You'll know

I fall into you
I fall into you

Hey, I wish I could show you more, 'cause baby you deserve some more, but still you're here and that's what I adore
Should've told you straight away, everything I had to say

Duncan,408,Paul Simon,"Couple in the next room
bound to win a prize
they've been going at it
all night long
Well I'm tryin' to get some sleep
but these motel walls are cheap
Lincoln Duncan is my name
and here's my song
here's my song
My father was a fisherman
my mama was a fisherman's friend
and I was born
in the boredom and the chowder
So when I reached my prime
I left my home in the Maritimes
headed down the turnpike for
New England
sweet New England

Holes in my confidence
holes in the knees of my jeans
I was left without a penny
in my pocket
Oooowee I was about
as destituted as a kid could be
and I wished I wore a ring
so I could hock it
I'd like to hock it
A young girl in a parkin' lot
was preaching to a crowd
singing sacred songs
and reading from the Bible
Well I told her I was lost
and she told all about the Pentecost
and I seen that girl
as the road to my survival

Just later on the very same night
when I crept to her
tent with a flashlight
and my long years
of innocence ended
well she took me to the woods
sayin' Here comes something
and it feels so good
and just like a dog
I was befriended
I was befriended

Oh oh what a night
oh what a garden of delight
Even now that sweet memory lingers
I was playing my guitar
lyin' underneath the stars
just thankin' the Lord
for my fingers
for my fingers"
Gold In The Air Of Summer,830,Kings Of Convenience,"Without giving anything away
I can say it's by the sea
It's a house that used to be
the home of a friend of mine

Without giving anything away
you'll find ships
inside of bottles
and the garden's over grown
the house is white
but the paint is coming of

I didn't know if you wanted to
when I came to pick you up
you didn't even hesitate
and now you and me are on our way
I think I've brought
everything we need
don't look back
don't think of the
other places you should have been
it's a good thing
that you came along with me

Gold in the air of summer
you'll shine like gold
in the air of summer
you'll shine like gold
in the air of summer
you'll shine like gold
in the air of summer"
Help Me Make It Through The Night,274,Kris Kristofferson,"Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose let it fall
Layin' soft up on my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
And i won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night"

Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light

Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound
Dont you dare look out your window darling
Everythings on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the musics gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound
Just close your eyes
Youll be alright
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound"
Eyes On You,"1,125",Chase Rice,"We've been to both Carolina's
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down
the coast a few times
London Paris paradise
But I ain't got much memory
of the scenes come to think
I miss them all every damn time
It's all your fault
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl
I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Speaking of the coast
remember Pfeiffer beach
You and me that sunset
cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about
that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw
All I needed too
Might as well have stayed
in the room
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl
I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Don't you remember Times Square
And people counting down
everywhere
2000 whatever no I didn't care
Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl
I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party any room
I'll be there all night
with my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you"
Your Light,83,Joshua Radin,"Where are you going? Where have you been?

[Verse 2]
I've never been perfect, I'm sure you can see
There's probably so much wrong with me
Sometimes I think I'll disappear
But I keep on waiting till you're here

[Chorus]
Most my days I've wandered alone
Told myself I'd never find home
But I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you
I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you

[Verse 3]
I'll light a fire if you are cold
I'll keep you laughing when we're old
I know you've heard these things before
But this time I hope you can't ignore that

[Chorus]
You and I have waited so long
Here with me is where you belong
'Cause I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you
I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you

[Bridge]
Remember the night I saw you
On the staircase dressed in white
Demanding the light as if I was called to you
Then you ran off into the night

[Chorus]
So I kept your light inside and I'm saving it for you
I kept your light inside and I'm saving it for you
Come get your light, I've been saving it for you"
Whole,48,Jordan Hart,"Come in love
This ain’t just common love
The stories they wrote for us
Are a thousand years old
Pick it up
The pen other lovers dropped
And color a page for us
Sincere as stone
Blur the edges
of the world you know
Fall into me let the spaces close
Whole
Tie them up
All of your broken chords
Cut by another’s words
It’s time to let it go
Fill your cup
Don’t give away too much
It’s give and take with us
And here is home
Once a silhouette of all you are
Now the vacancy
inside my heart is whole
Take the time you
need to change and heal
Let me show you
you are made to feel whole
Whole
Taking in the motions
You were moving like a poet
I was falling I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
You were wading in the water
Dancing through your karma
I was falling I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
I was taking in the motions
You were moving like a poet
I was falling I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
Falling in we’re falling into chorus
Falling in we’re falling in
Falling in we’re falling in"
Fever,"1,128",Kings Of Convenience,"Fever
You've got fever
'Cause you had too much fun
With someone who now is gone
and can't take care of you

You've got fever
Driving around on your scooter
In Christmastime
with funky clothes
that don't take care of you
Now you feel warm and cold and
warm and cold warm
Warm and cold and
warm and cold warm
Fever
You've got fever
A new time for taking care
Of that same one
who now is gone and
can´t take care of you
Fever
I've got fever too
Of a different kind
it makes me warm
It makes me crave
to be with you almost every
second of the day
And I feel warm and cold and
warm and cold warm
Warm and cold and
warm and cold warm"
Right on Time,297,Brandi Carlile,"Come back now

to take it out on you
I know I always do
you're the strongest person
in the room
Turn back time
help me to rewind and we can
Find ourselves again
It's not too late
Either way
I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time
Don't look down
I can feel it
when your heart starts pounding
It's beyond your control
you know it is
It's getting to the point
where I can't carry on
I never held my breath
for quite this long
And I don't take it back
I did what I had to do
It's not too late
Either way
I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time
It's not too late
Either way
I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time"

Timeless (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),456,Taylor Swift,"Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a '30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' grey
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Down the block, there's an antique shop
And somethin' in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in"
The Story Of Us (Taylor's Version),415,Taylor Swift,"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, ""they're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end"
La Lune,"3,615",Billie Marten,"Breaking my back
in the heart of this land
Feet above water
and softened in sand
I could have wanted any part of this
But I find the heat is too
harsh on the skin
Drowning in light need
the cold to sink into my soul
My soul
Ignore signs of change no more
I come back again I am flawed
Swallow me whole
with the moon on my back
One side is pink
and the other is black
I'm good at hiding
in the dead and grey
But time after time
I've been people I'm not
Places we go to
are all that we've got
So why don't we go
So why don't we go
I'll never know
Ignore signs of change no more
I come back again I am flawed"
Carry You,"1,696",Novo Amor,"Torn down full of aching
Somehow our youth would
take the blame
Worn out the way we let it stay
Taught how to celebrate it
All out I'd replicate your pain
Climb down if only for a taste
Hallowed but hesitated
Shallow
but full in all your veins
Shadowed by every other weight
Hollow a doubt can make it
Borrowed a love that never came
Followed in every other shade
Let it lead your love away
I never strayed
Let it bury you away
In all your blame
in all your pain
I will carry you always
Let it lead your love away
I never strayed
Let it bury you away
Fade me away
I won't ever be the same
Fade me away
I won't ever be the same
Fade me away
I won't ever be the same"
Hurricane,510,Anson Seabra,"Oh you were my hurricane
'Cause in your eyes I felt so safe
And in them
I found shelter from the storm
The rain would pour
the waves would break
And in my lowest
coldest place
You were always
there to keep me warm
And even when the wind
would roar
You were such a perfect storm
And even when you left me
broke and cold
There is nothing I want more
Oh you were my hurricane
'Cause somehow the more
time you stayed
The damage just kept getting
worse and worse
While power lines
were breaking free
The maelstrom started shaking me
The scars that you would
leave began to hurt
And even when the wind would roar
You were such a perfect storm
And even when you left me
broke and cold
There is nothing I want more
Oh you were my hurricane
'Cause when you finally dissipated
There was nothing left of both of us
The sea was still the sky was grey
But now with no more hurricane
There was nothing left
for me to run from
And even when the wind would roar
You were such a perfect storm
And even when you left me
broke and cold
There is nothing I want more
Yeah even when you left me
broke and cold
There is nothing I want more"
Love Life,279,Stephen Sanchez,"I’ve got scars on my wrist
from where I used to cut
I didn’t wanna live
but I still wanted love
Oh, she kept me around
for a little while longer
Just a man in his head to
afraid to commit
But a little drop of blood helped
him not to forget that he might
wanna stay for a little while longer
And all these streams down your cheeks
I can see that your insides dying,
less time smiling more time crying
I know you want this to be over
I can see that your heartbeats shaking,
I know it’s hard if I’m not mistaken
I know you want to try,
to try to love life
Again
Oh, the fuel that keeps me driving
are my flesh and my bones
But now those are growing scarce
since I used up my soul
Oh, she kept me around
for a little while longer
I ran around with strangers
and I tried to be fun
But, even when surrounded I still
feel numb all the time
I can see that your insides dying,
less time smiling more time crying
I know you want this to be over
I can see that your heartbeats shaking,
I know it’s hard if I’m not mistaken
I know you want to try,
to try to love life
Oh, I just need someone to
hear me when I call
Though I am screaming next to-
You don’t hear me at all
Are you listening at all?
Are you listening at all?
I can see that your insides dying,
less time smiling more time crying
I know you want this to be over
I can see that your heartbeats shaking,
I know it’s hard if I’m not mistaken
I know you want to try,
to try to love life"
Heartbreak & Alcohol,7,BRELAND,"I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol
I line ‘em up and I drink ‘em all,
I lost the one I need something strong
Just to get me thru the pain that i’m feeling,
I'm goin’ in like a wrecking ball,
Don't hit me up, I'll be missing calls,
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol,
Baby it’s gon be one hell of a weekend

I had a hundred one-nights none like you and me,
And I drink but that don’t bring back a summer I can’t repeat,
Lately I can’t even smoke something,
Gives me anxiety,
It'll turn on all the floodlights hanging over memories

Back when we almost had it all but you ain’t reminiscing If there’s someone else you’re kissin
All we had is gone
Like I’m about to be, bout to be

I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol
I line ‘em up and I drink ‘em all,
I lost the one I need something strong
Just to get me thru the pain that i’m feeling,
I'm goin’ in like a wrecking ball,
Don't hit me up, I'll be missing calls,
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol,
Baby it’s gon be one hell of a weekend

I'm gettin some advice I know I shouldn’t listen to,
Cause I wanna make you miss me more than I’m missin you,
Got trouble on my arm, I ain’t even tryna hide it,
So it gets back to you and then you’ll be reminded,

Of when we almost had it all
But you ain’t reminiscing
If there’s someone else you’re kissin
All we had is gone like I’m about to be, bout to be

I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol
I line ‘em up and I drink ‘em all,
I lost the one I need something strong
Just to get me thru the pain that i’m feeling,
I'm goin’ in like a wrecking ball,
Don't hit me up, I'll be missing calls,

Baby it’s gon be one hell of a weekend"
Sunny Came Home,"2,529",Shawn Colvin,"Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission
She says days
go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly
out of my mind
Into the fire

Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few
small repairs she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance
She says days
go by I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly
out of my mind
Into the fire
Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years you always knew it
Strike a match go on and do it
Days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly
out of my mind
Into the fire
Light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own
and she's alright
Sunny came home

Sunny came home"
Diamonds And Rust,465,Joan Baez,"Well I'll be damned
Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall
As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what
memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed
Now I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there
Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of
that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes I loved you dearly
And if you're offering me
diamonds and rust
I've already paid"
Live Long,"2,512",Kings Of Convenience,"Summerchild that sits
by the water
weaving sunlight threads in
his hands
The golden river that
day a shelter
a stream where he could
make pebbles dance
You looked around you
nobody had taken
any notice of what you saw
Against the evening
sky a formation
a million black birds
looking like one
Live long save ten years
to remember
live long hold it in front of
your eyes once more
Live long save ten years
to remember
live long hold it in front of
your eyes"
Don't Worry,97,Marty Robbins,"Don't worry 'bout me, it's all over now
Though I may be blue, I'll manage somehow.
Love can't be explained, can't be controlled
One day it's warm, next day it's cold.

Don't pity me 'cause I'm feelin' blue;
Don't be ashamed, it might have been you.
Oh-oh-oh, oh, love,
Kiss me one time, then go, love,
I understand, don't worry 'bout me.

Sweet, sweet, sweet love, I want you to be
As happy as I when you loved me.
I'll never forget you, your sweet memory
It's all over now, don't worry 'bout me.

When one heart tells one heart, one heart good-bye,
One heart is free; one heart will cry.
Oh-oh-oh, oh, sweet, sweet baby, sweet baby, sweet,
It's all right, don't worry 'bout me."

And I don't know why
Lights are on
But nobody's home
There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love
Like our love
love love love love
Let the last ones go
And roll in tonight
Don't wake us up
We got nothing for you
There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love
Like our love
love love love love
Build us a dome
And rest here with me
Lights are on

There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love"
Love Story,82,Velvet Moon,"Nothing ever felt as good
Or as easy, as when we were young oh
Though I felt misunderstood
It was a pleasure
Running away with you

We were just children, acting like adults, crazy naive bold and carefree
We were kids having kids, crazy naive it amazes me
That we didn't fall apart, harder than we did

Now they keep us on speaking terms
We grow and we learn, I have no regrets only forgets
A big thank you to life, for giving us sand
When the timing's right there's no wasteland

We were just children, acting like adults, crazy naive bold and carefree
We were kids having kids, crazy naive it amazes me
That we didn't fall apart, harder than we did

Life keeps on moving
Life goes on changing

We were just children, acting like adults, crazy naive bold and carefree
We were kids having kids, crazy naive it amazes me
That we didn't fall apart, harder than we did"

Better Than Revenge (Taylor's Version),497,Taylor Swift,"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better

How is your sister I heard
she got her degree
And I said
That makes me feel old

How is playing drums
You said it's too

Ours,"4,055",Taylor Swift,"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me
wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about
their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs
Seems like there's always
someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like
they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from
those with nothing else to do
The jury's out
but my choice is you
So don't you worry your
pretty little mind
People throw rocks at
things that shine
and life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people
have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna
jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with
their lipgloss smiles
But I don't care
Cause right now you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your
pretty little mind
People throw rocks at
things that shine
and life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough but
they are where mine belong in
I'll fight their doubt
and give you faith
with this song for you

Cause I love the gap
between your teeth
and I love the riddles
that you speak
And any snide remarks
from my father about your
tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours
So don't your worry your
pretty little mind
People throw rocks at
things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your
pretty little mind
People throw rocks at

That love that I once felt for you
Is by now as good as dead
No I'm not fooling anyone
And least of all myself
I still believe that you will come
And take me back again
What good is it to comb my hair
It won't be touched by you

Why go outside It's lonely there

The air is warm and clear

Is cold and senseless now"

you're looking at me right now
It may not be next week, what I need
Then again, maybe it might be
Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first
I gotta have ya, gotta see if this works
I gotta have ya, wake up in your t-shirt
Who knows what'll happen,
ain't that always kinda magic
When you don't know
who's holding the cards
Could be a wish I never knew ya
or permanently tattoo ya
Only the moon knows
what's in the stars (what's in the stars)
Mm, that voice in my head
says to slow down
But it can't feel your hands
on my hips right now
It may not be next year, what I need
Then again, maybe it might be
Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first
I gotta have ya, gotta see if this works
(I gotta have ya)
I gotta have ya, wake up in your t-shirt
I gotta have ya, diving in heart first
(Heart first)
I gotta have ya
Ooh, I gotta have ya
And I can't even stop myself anymore
(Ooh, I gotta have ya)
Oh, we couldn't end the perfect night
outside my front door
Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first
I gotta have ya, gotta see if this works
(I gotta have ya)
I gotta have ya, wake up in your t-shirt
(Wake up in your t-shirt, yeah)
I gotta have ya, diving in heart first
(Diving in heart first)
I gotta have ya
Yeah, I gotta have ya"

Green Green Grass Of Home,250,Kenny Rogers,"The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me
is my Mama and Papa
And down the road I look
and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch
the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me
Arms are reaching
smiling sweetly
It's good to touch
the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Tho' the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree
that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk
with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch
the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me
Arms are reaching
smiling sweetly
It's good to touch
the green green grass of home
Then I awake
and look around me
At four grey walls
that surround me
And I realize
that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard
and there's a sad old Padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch
the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me'neath
the green green grass of home"
Wayfaring Stranger,420,Emmylou Harris,"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling thru
this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness
toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home

I know dark clouds
will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields
lie just before me
Where God's redeemed
their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home"
Time (Remastered 2001),234,Glen Campbell,"Some people run
Some people crawl
Some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forward
Some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in white
Some wrapped in fearful black
Some people never get
And some never give
Some people never die
But some never live
Some folks they treat me mean
Some treat me kind
But most folks just go their way
Don't pay me no mind
Time oh good good time
Where did you go
Time oh good good time
Where did you go
Sometimes I'm satisfied
Sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold
Sometimes it's hot
At sunset I laugh
But at sunrise I cry
At midnight I'm in between
And wondering why
Time oh good good time
Where did you go
Time oh good good time
Where did you go"
Me In You,"2,383",Kings Of Convenience,"Crossroads and given the option
To pass and look back
at goals I`ve missed
Rainbows or burning bridges
If you squint a little more
it looks the same
But oh
There`s a little bit of me inside you
Gathering what you`ve lost
But oh
There`s a little bit of you in everyone
Can never keep a secret
Problem lines on your face
You smooth them out
so no one can tell
put a straight back upon a stage
could dance dance
hide the tremor in your hand
But oh
There`s a little bit of me inside you
Gathering what you`ve lost
But oh
There`s a little bit of you in everyone
And I`m watching you now
I see you building the castle
with one hand
while tearing down another
with the other
And I`m watching you now
I see you building the castle
with one hand
while tearing down another
with the other
And I`m watching you now
I see you building the castle
with one hand
while tearing down another
with the other"
You've Got A Friend,211,Carole King,"""When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there yes I will

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, desert you
And take your soul if you let them, don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running running running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Way With Words,319,Bahamas,"I had a way with words for a while
You call it substance over style
Now I hear laugh

I would've stuck around

lets his brother down
Oh while I was gone think about
all that you found
A dear old friend
and a brand new sound
I am one man
I can do anything
We are not far
We can do anything
Is the whole thing just a test
Is there something
you should get off your chest
Don't keep me waiting on some SMS
Don't keep it all so close to the vest
I am one man
I can do anything
We are not far
We can do anything
Our return will come some day
The three of us will laugh and play
I know that we can find a way
Put it all behind us
Nothing to remind us
To put it all behind us
There'll be nothing to remind us
Won't hold my breath
won't wait in vain
Won't single you out
won't lay blame
I won't protest
but I won't be the same
'Cause I'm the only one
who has my name
I am one man

I can do anything

Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch

Jump in the shower

With folks like me
on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5

crazy if you let it

deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead
but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that
man is out to get me
They let you dream
just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step
on the boss-man's ladder

I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault) (Feat. Chris Stapleton),"1,063",Taylor Swift,"3 AM and I'm still awake
I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city
that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed
has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you
she's better than me huh
Well I tried to fit in
with your upper-crust circles
Yeah they let me sit in back
when we were in love
Oh they sit around talkin'
about the meaning of life
And the book that just
saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder
to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up
in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous shiny
bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm
no it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin'
and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like
an early spring snow
But reality crept in
you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams
rolled your eyes at my jokes
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all
the space that you need
I don't have to be your shrink
to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me
Oh block it all out
The voices so loud sayin'
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had
Now you're out in the world
searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip
scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status
last time you felt free
Was when none of that
shit mattered 'cause you were with me
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
That it turned out I'm harder
to forget than I was to leave
And yeah I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me
when you're out
At your cool indie music
concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes
and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
Oh my god she's insane
she wrote a song about me
I bet you think about me"

Jesus loves you more than

Heaven holds a place for those
who pray
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)

We'd like to know a little bit

Stroll around the grounds

Heaven holds a place for those who pray

Hide it in a hiding place
where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry
with your cupcakes
It's a little secret,
just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids

American Pie,535,Don McLean,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me
smile
And I knew if I had my chance
that I could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver with every paper I'd
daliver
Bad news on the doorstap
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his
widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside the day the music
died.So bye bye Miss American pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinkin' whisky ane rye
singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love and
do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rook and roll
can Music save your mortal soul and
can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well I know that you're in love with him
cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shose
Man, I dig those rhythm and bluses
I was a lonely teenage broncin's buck
with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died.
I started singing bye bye
Now for ten years we've been on our own
and moss grows fat on a rollin's stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the Jester sang for the king and Queen in a coat
He Borrowned from James Dean and a voice that came
from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down the Jester
stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
And while Lennin read a book on Marx
the coart took practice in the park and we SONG
dirties in the dark
the day the music died. We were singin's bye bye

Helter-skelter in the summer sweiter
the birds flew off with a fall-out shelter
Eight miles high and fallin's fast, it landed foul on
the gress
the players tried for a forware pass,
with the Jester on the sidelines in a coat
Now the half-time air was sweet paerfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance but we never got the chance
Cause the players tried to take the field,
the marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died
We started singin's bye bye
In there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space with no time left to start
again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack sat on a candlestick cause fire is the devils
only friend
(Oh) as I watched him on the stage,
my hands were clenched in festive rage
No angel born in heaven could break that stan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
the sacrificial rite I saw satan
Laughing with delight the day the music died.
He was singin's bye byeI met girl who sang the blues and I asked her for
some happy news
but the just smiled and turned away I went down to
the sacred store
where I heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
The lovers cried and the posts dreamed
(But) Not a word was spoken, the church bells all
were broken
And he three man I admire most the Father,
Son an the holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died.
And they were singin' bye bye"

Autumn Town Leaves,232,iron & wine,"In this autumn town
where the leaves can fall
On either side of the garden wall
We laugh all night
to keep the embers blowing
Some are leaping free
from their moving cars
Stacking stones
'round their broken hearts
Waving down any wind
that might come blowing
Ice move out when the field is cut
Serpents curl
when the sun comes up
Songbirds only end up
where they're going
Some get rain and some get snow
Some want love and some want gold
I just want to see you
in the morning
Dogs lay down in the evening heat
Fish do worse
when they leave the sea
Songbirds only end up
where they're going
In this autumn town
where the lights can change
Some get mercy and some get blamed
Some get lost
when they feel the river flowing
It's all holy smoke
and the flame dies fast
We hold our hats
while the days fly past
Cold wind comes and we wait
but it keeps going
Father Sons and Holy Ghosts
All come back
or they all come close
Songbirds only end up
where they're going
Some get hard and some go home
Some want flesh and some want bone
I just want to see you
in the morning
Yeah I just want to see you
in the morning"

be a little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too maybe
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do
It's me and you boy
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

Bad Blood,11,Trousdale,"Bad blood living in the city
It’s okay I know that you miss me
You “meant well”
What the hell does that mean anyway
In the attic I keep all our sweet memories
And forgotten dreams
Now we’re collecting dust in a pile of stuff
That means everything
You meant everything to me
Oh
Now we got bad blood living in the city
It’s okay, I know that you miss me
You “meant well”
What the hell does that mean anyway, anyway
Now you found someone and she looks like me
At least that’s what I choose to believe
If I saw you with her at the reservoir
She’d have that look like you had hung the stars
All the times I held you up so high
You’ll never say it
But you know I’m right, we got
Bad blood living in the city
It’s okay, I know that you miss me
You “meant well”
What the hell does that mean anyway, anyway
You know we got
Bad blood (bad blood)
You know that it’s all true, love (true, love)
And now that we got bad blood (bad blood)
I know it wasn’t true love (true love, true love)
I don’t want
Bad blood, living in the city
It’s okay, you don’t have to miss me
Oh well, I don’t wanna dwell on it
Anymore, anyway
But I gotta say it’s
True, love
You didn’t deserve me
Don’t say you don’t know how you hurt me
You meant well
What the hell does that mean anyway anyway
You know that we got
Bad blood (bad blood)
You know that it’s all true, love (true, love)
And now that we got bad blood (bad blood)
I know it wasn’t true love (true love, true love)
In the end all I have are some pictures saved
They mean everything
But they won’t someday"
goodbye and godspeed,51,Sarah Kang,"Why does the sun rise to set again?
Why do leaves grow and fall by autumn’s end?
Why do friends grow apart with no one to blame?
Why is it hard to change?

Why do flowers bloom only to die someday?
Why does snow become rain in May?
Why did I choose to run away?
You told me I should stay

Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Who knows if I’ll see you again
But for now I know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend

Why do roads cross only to part again?
Why do we leave so many things unsaid?
Why do we have to say farewell?
I guess only time will tell

Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Who knows if I’ll see you again
But for now we both know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend

Sometimes when I’m looking up at the moon
I’ll wonder if you see it, too
If you don’t forget me, I won’t forget you

Goodbye and godspeed my friend
I hope that I’ll see you again
But for now I know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend"
Nothing New (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault) (Feat. Phoebe Bridgers),716,Taylor Swift,"They tell you while you're young
Girls go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones
Who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say
She looks like she's been through it
Lord what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad
but this is what I think about
And I wake up
in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person
know everything at 18
But nothing at 22
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new
How long will it be cute
All this crying in my room
When you can't blame
it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time
till I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room
People love an ingenue
I've had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up
to breaking down
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person
know everything at 18
But nothing at 22
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new
I know someday
I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance
you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and
then she'll say she
got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her
then I'll cry myself to sleep
I've had too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll
miss me once they drive me out
I wake up in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person
know everything at 18
But nothing at 22
And will you still want me
Will you still want me
Will you still want me
When I'm nothing new"
Second To Numb,678,Kings Of Convenience,"He won't touch you anymore
Staying inside
Half indifferent half afraid
It will only make you cry
What is given can't be returned
The cards are in our hands
All that is living can be hurt
And that's the end of innocence
Second round found you
beating death
The miracle of life
Once each of you
caught your breath
A question simmers inside
How far away from being in
Can there be stated of love
How to put it is
you're bound within
What matter is it made of
What will we become
What will we become
What will we become
Second to numb"
Autumn Leaves,"1,984",Ed Sheeran,"Another day another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated
Do you ever wonder
if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday
you were here with me
Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated
Is it that it's over
or do birds still sing for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday
you were here with me
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song
that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I I miss you
and I wish you'd stay
Do you ever wonder
if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday
you were here with me
Ooh oh ooh oh
Ooh oh ooh oh
Touch down
Like a seven four seven
Stay out
and we'll live forever now"
Knockin' on Heaven's Door (Remastered),188,Bob Dylan,"Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore.
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door"
Broken Feather,21,Harrison Storm,"Broken feather made me cry
Lost and wounded I realised lies
We don't need, no one to wither us away
Sit still tree, gently sway

Broken feather scattered down from the sky
Hoping with her, we all need sacrifice from our ways

We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean

Open windows, set the sail beneath my wings
We are the light that we are glowing in
She kissed my lips as fast as the wind
You and I, queens and kings

We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean"
Life of the Party,"1,717",Ingrid Andress,"I'm laughin' I'm dancin'

Can You Hear Me,600,Anson Seabra,"I've been chasing the pavement
I've been sleeping with strangers
Dealing in danger
Passing by faces so cold
I've been running to places
I've been broken and nameless
Hopeless and shamed
I've never been so low
Zoom out to everything
Zoom into me
Zoom out to tragedy
Zoom into me
Can you hear me out there
Can you help me I'm scared
Can you lift me
can you give me a sign
Can you beat back the night
Can you make things alright
Can you hold me
can you show me the light
All alone in the basement
Where it's always the same and
Nothing can change and
no one can see me cry
I don't know how to face it
I don't know how to name it
know who to blame
But nothing seems alright
Zoom out to everything
Zoom into me
Zoom out to tragedy
Zoom in to me
Can you hear me out there
Can you help me I'm scared
Can you lift me
can you give me a sign
Can you beat back the night
Can you make things alright
Can you hold me
can you show me the light
Mmmm mmmm
Mmmm mmmm
Can you hear me out there
Can you help me I'm scared
Can you lift me
can you give me a sign
Can you beat back the night
Can you make things alright
Can you hold me
can you show me the light"
Better Days,128,Alexis Donn,"These past few years
I’ve fought the weather
and everything I can’t control
These past few months
I’ve felt a pressure
That I’ve never known
I cant help but think
that I might need a change of mind
If I want to live this life
instead of wasting my own time
Lately I’ve been changing things
My priorities
For the better
Getting my toes on a beach
Where service don’t reach
With my lover
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
We’re headed for
better day, day, days
Deleted my social media
Nearly threw out my phone
Tired of looking for the answers
In the wrong scroll
I don’t want to medicate
There must be a way
To remember all the colors
Before the world went gray
Lately I’ve been changing things
My priorities
For the better
Getting my toes on a beach
Where service don’t reach
With my lover
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
We’re headed for better day, day, days
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
I can see it in your face, face, face
Lately I’ve been changing things
My priorities
For the better
Getting my toes on a beach
Where service don’t reach
With my lover
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
We’re headed for better day, day, days"
Everything Has Changed (Taylor's Version) (Feat. Ed Sheeran),776,Taylor Swift,"You good to go
All I knew this morning
when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen
since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
and your smile
In the back of my mind
making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you
know you know you
'Cause all I know is we said
Hello
And your eyes
look like coming home
All I know is a simplе name
Everything has changed
All I know is you hеld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall
painted blue
And I'll take 'em down
take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach
is butterflies
The beautiful kind
making up for lost time
Taking flight
making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you
know you know you
'Cause all I know is we said
Hello
And your eyes
look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you
all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know
that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you
know you know you
'Cause all I know is we said
Hello
And your eyes
look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said Hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed"
10 Summers,23,Ashley Singh,"You’re less like my lover and more like my therapist
I let all of my problems
Weigh down on your chest

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to love a good time, up all night, you’d get high
Now all you do is live life with no smile by my side, oh

[Chorus]
So you gotta go
Leave
Don’t waste your twenties on me
You’re young, free
But I feel you falling asleep
Oh, ten summers ain’t a lot and I’ve already taken three
So go
Leave
Don’t waste your twenties on me

[Verse 2]
You were so full of color
I made you a pessimist
I think maybe I’m jеalous of all of your best friends

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to lovе a
Good time, up all night, you’d get high, oh
Now all you do is
Live life with no smile by my side

[Chorus]
So you gotta go
Leave
Don’t waste your twenties on me
You’re young, free
But I feel you falling asleep
Ten summers ain’t a lot and I’ve already taken three
So go
Leave
Don’t waste your twenties on me
Don’t waste your twenties on me

Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da

Go, leave
Don’t waste your twenties on me"
Last Kiss (Taylor's Version),303,Taylor Swift,"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
O-ooh-ooh
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last"
Bubbly,"1,840",Colbie Caillat,"I've been awake for a while now
you've got me feelin

in a silly place
It starts in my toes
and I crinkle my nose
where ever it goes i always know

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feelin shows
Cause you make me smile
Baby just take your time
Holdin me tight
Where ever where ever

Where ever where ever
where ever you go

Better Than Revenge,"1,426",Taylor Swift,"Now go stand in the corner
and think about what you did

Ha

The story starts when it was
hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him
right there where I wanted him
She came along got him along
and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than
you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming
nor did I suspected it
I underestimated
just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain
was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just
who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known for the
things that she does
On the mattress
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do
better than revenge

She lives her life like it's a
party and she's on the list
She looks at me like
I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present
frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho
Cause I like to rhyme her
name with things
but
Sophistication isn't
what you wear
or who you know
Or pushing people down to
get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that
in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses
gives you dignity
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known for the things
that she does
On the mattress
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do
better than revenge Ha ha
I'm just another thing for you
to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to
roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but I always get the last word

She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known for the things
that she does
On the mattress
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing
I do better than revenge
And do you still
feel like you know
what you're doing
Cause I don't think you do Oh
Do you still feel like
you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much
better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than
you can say sabotage"
More,494,Hunter Hayes,"You're singing in the shower
like there's no one else around
Sliding down the hallway
dancing around the house
One glass of champagne and girl
you're painting up the town
That's when I love you more
When you're late
for your friends party
'cause you can't find
a thing to wear
You start cussing at humidity
and fussing with your hair
You give up and
throw a T-Shirt on like
you don't even care
That's when I love you more
With every minute
every up and down again
As long as you're in it girl
my world keeps getting better
I swear I can't fall harder
oh but I said that before
And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that I love you more
When you can't see the sun
cause it raining in your eyes
There's clouds around your halo
and your wings won't let you fly
When the whole
world gets too heavy
Well baby that's
when I'm gonna love you more
Yeah love you more
With every minute
every up and down again
As long as you're in it girl
my world keeps getting better
I swear I can't fall harder

And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that
I love you more yeah
Love you more oh
No it ain't a competition
and I ain't keeping score
I love you more
I love you more
Maybe I can't see the future
one thing I know for sure
I'm gonna love you more
gonna love you more
With every minute
every up and down again
As long as you're in it girl

Cartoon People,418,Billie Marten,"It doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
It's bigger than the rest
of us he'll promise you that
I'm glad I'm glad
He's picking up the drinks
and then he's knocking
them back
I've never seen someone
who wears a sad little
mask like that
like that
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his hand
Is busy today
with someone else's plans
He chooses life and then
she chooses a man
It doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
In any case I look at him
my life ain't half as bad
as bad
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his hand
Is busy today
with someone else's plans
He chooses life
and then she chooses a man
He's picking it up
but she don't give a damn
Hold me
it's a crisis
that we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting
an American war
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away
Hold me
it's a crisis that we're

Thief,"1,062",Alexander Jean,"There you are
Like the man of my dreams
There you go
Saying all of the right things
I'm just a girl
At least that's what you think
If love's a crime
I'll rob you blind
You hunt your prey
like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you
wanting more
But baby I got you beat
got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait
but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking thief
A heartbreaking thief
Try and go
If you think you can escape
But my claws
Are in too deep for you
to get away
You're in control
At least that's what you'll say
Cause we both tell
the story different
You were mine from the beginning
You hunt your prey
like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you
wanting more
But baby I got you beat
got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait
but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking thief
A heartbreaking thief
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn scorn
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn scorn
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn

The Man with the Axe,68,Lorde,"If I had to break it down
I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Movin' the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away

[Chorus]
And your office job and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed
For all these years

[Verse 2]
I thought I was a genius, but now I'm twenty-two
And it's startin' to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away

[Chorus]
With my fist full of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds like favorite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

[Verse 3]
I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully fallin' apart for the Princess of Norway

[Chorus]
But you, with your tall slashes, your infinite t-shirts
I should've known when your favorite record was the same as my father's
You'd take me down

[Verse 4]
I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words, and halfway to space
But there, by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

[Chorus]
You found me clean as a pine
The man with the axe and the look in his eyes
We've been through so many hard times
I'm writin' a love song for you, baby"
Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version),644,Taylor Swift,"I'm pretty sure
we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone
across the room at you
I was expecting
some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning
I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should
never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came
in wearing a football helmet
And said Okay let's talk
And I said
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you
for quite some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay
Before you I'd only dated
self-indulgent takers
Who took all
of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries
and now I'm always laughing
And I love you
because you have given me
No choice but to
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite
some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay stay stay stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out
with you all the time
All those times
that you didn't leave
it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
for my whole life
Stay and I'll be loving you
for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me
when I get mad mad mad
So I think that it's best
if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite
some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite
some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay
Ha-ha-ha it's so fun"

Purple Irises,40,Gwen Stefani,"But if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you

Everything fades
Everything dies
Put me in a vase, but you can't
You can't stop time

It's not 1999
But this face is still mine
The way you look at me
I swear my heart hits rewind

But if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let 'em change your mind
Wonder why you took a risk
On a broken heart you cannot fix
No, I never knew a love like this
Now we're picking purple irises

I got you
And you got me
And do you still think I'm pretty?
And are you happy?

It's not 2014
But you still look good in those jeans
Lookin' in the mirror
Do you see what I see?

But if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let 'em change your mind
Wonder why you took a risk
On a broken heart you cannot fix
No, I never knew a love like this
Now we're picking purple irises

And we're blooming into the change
I'm overthinking it
Picking purple irises
And leaving love stains
I got violet memories
I'm overthinking it
Oh, and leaving love stains
Love stains

But if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let 'em change your mind
Oh, if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let 'em change your mind
Wonder why you took a risk
On a broken heart you cannot fix
No, I never knew a love like this
Now we're picking purple irises"
Beautiful Crazy,"2,229",Luke Combs,"Her day starts with a coffee
and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready
so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that come
get me look in her eyes
Well it kinda scares me
the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild
Beautiful crazy
she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy
but her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend
can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says 'let's stay on the couch
and watch TV'
And she falls asleep
Beautiful crazy
she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy
but her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable unforgettable
It's unusual unbelievable
How I'm such a fool
yeah I'm such a fool for her
Beautiful crazy
she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy she's crazy
she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me"
For The Both of Us,144,Dan + Shay,"Now that it’s just me and you
Can we talk for a few
I’ve got something to get off my chest
You probably already know
Been in my boots before
My heart’s racing like hell but I guess

I’m just gonna say it out loud

I’m in love with your daughter
And I’ve been since the first time I saw her I’ll ask her the question
If you give your blessing
When she takes my hand you can trust I’ll love her enough for the both of us

I know that you loved her first
But for better or worse
I’ll treat her like you prayed that I would

When she’s all dressed in white
And you’re giving her away
For the rest of my life
You can trust when I say

She’ll always be your baby girl
And I’m gonna give her the world"
Cocaine,327,Eric Clapton,"If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out; cocaine.
If you wanna get down, down on the ground; cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie; cocaine.

If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues; cocaine.
When your day is done and you wanna run; cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie; cocaine.

If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on; cocaine.
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back; cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie; cocaine.

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie; cocaine."
Love Story,"4,865",Taylor Swift,"We were both young
when I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony of summer air
See the lights
See the party
the ball gowns
I see you make your way
through the crowd
You say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo you
were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go
and I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting all
there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
So I sneak out
to the garden to see you
We keep quiet
cause we're dead if they know
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were
Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go
and I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting all
there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me
they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
but it's real
Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if
you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the
outskirts of town
I said
Romeo save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting
for you but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knealt to the ground
and pulled out a ring
And said
Marry me
Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and
that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go
pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes

Cause we were both young
when I first saw you"
In The Moonlight,"2,113",Susie Suh,"When I see you I see me
Caged heart
Passion up your sleeve
A music cocoon surrounding me
I know you know it but
How do we show it
There's too much to lose
But tonight we choose
So we dance alone in the moonlight
Just you & I
And the stars and I'm falling
through the sky
To find it ah ah
And there's magic in the air
A lonest flower floating
out of despair
And my winter sun
You are my broken one
Craze of sand her heart to grasp
As the future slips on past
All we've got is this moment
And I say we own it
So we dance alone in the moonlight
Just you & I
And the stars and I'm falling
through the sky
To find it ah ah ah
Oooh oh
So we dance alone in the moonlight
Just you & I
And the stars and I'm falling
through the sky
To find it ah ah ah
And I know it can't be sure
But I have to follow more
I'm waiting for a cure
ah ah ah"
Daniel,"2,420",Devendra Banhart,"We once had a time
Meet me at the Castro tonight
I held a rose
You held who knows
But that's fine
We fell in love
We fell in love
At the John Reed Choir
And right there and then
I swore to no end
Swore to never let you go
But love's got a way of fading away
Oh I never saw you again
I never saw you again
Waiting in line
To see Suede play and
We had a time
I wished we could stay in
Waiting in line
To see Suede play"
Goodnight & Goodbye,832,Mree,"Oh how I love
how the sun lays upon us
Staining the inches of skin
Oh says the clouds
as they whisper above us
Oh what a life it's been
And all of the lies we've lied
And all of the time
that's timed our lives
How do we know
what's wrong or right this time
When all of the trees
falling down to the ground and
Fall to your knees
like a child that is crawling
All the while
we never stop to smile
Oh how she loves how
the spring comes to greet her
With lands overflowing
with green
All of the drops pulling down
'till they meet us
Latching themselves onto me
We may not have
missed this time
But then when they all run dry
And that beautiful light
that lights our eyes is gone
What have we done
When all of the trees
falling down to the ground and
Fall to your knees
like a child that is crawling
All the while we never
stop to stare
Do we even care
When all of the tears
from her eyes have collected
Form in the skies
and leave us unprotected
I can't fathom
why we say goodnight
When we mean to say goodbye"
Party Of One (feat. Sam Smith),"1,631",Brandi Carlile,"Waiter send this to the table
the party of one
The only other lonely soul
in this place
And so you're finishing up
your coffee
But then where you're gonna run
Where'd you get
that look on your face
You should always
let the sun go down on your anger
Let it burn you to sleep
Bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
But I am tired
And I am yours
Don't even think about your freedom
Or taking that flight
Or going back upon your
promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your
I statements and
your weaponized words
Are paper tigers now
Oh your constant overthinking
and your secretive drinking
Are making you
more and more alone
And girl you can slam
the door behind you
It ain't ever gonna close
Because when you're home
you're already home
I am tired
I am tired
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore
I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
And I'm coming home
'Cause I am yours I am yours
I am yours I am yours I am yours
I am yours I am yours I am yours
I am yours I am yours"

Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye
and told me you
would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've been waitin'
for you all my life
Mr. Every single day until the end
I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know
Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone
I fall apart
It takes everything in me
just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see
that you're okay
Hello Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after
breaking mine
Mr. Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Hello Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery

And you're Mr. Perfectly fine

Mr. Never had to see me cry
Mr. Insincere apology
so he doesn't look
like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even
heard my name
Well I thought you might be
different than the rest
I guess you're all the same
'Cause I hear he's got his arm
'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart
he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past
what you put me through

And you're Mr. Perfectly fine
So dignified in your
well-pressed suit
So strategized all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room
Oh he's so smug Mr. Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss
Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then you'll be Mr. Too late
Goodbye Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after
breakin' mine

at the right time baby
Goodbye Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery

You said you'd never go away"
Dear Dad,12,Your Crush,"[Intro]
Hey, this is Dad. Just, uh, calling to say hi.
Just wondering what you’re up to.
Um, give me a call back when you get a chance, ‘kay?
Bye.

[Verse 1]
I can’t sleep again
I’ve been having nightmares about you, Dad
I was hurt, you turned away
Said, “Don’t make a scene, or Mama will get mad”

[Pre-Chorus]
When I need you, you’re just halfway there
So I had to learn to hold back the tears

[Chorus]
I’ve been feeling lonely
I wish I could talk to you
But you never listen
The way that I need you to
And I miss you, but I’ll let you go
So I’ll just be lonely without you

[Verse 2]
I was seventeen
She yelled at me everyday
You heard every word
And then you looked away

[Pre-Chorus]
I grew up way too fast
To make up for the love I never had

[Chorus]
I’ve been feeling lonely
I wish I could talk to you
But you never listen
The way that I need you to
And I miss you, but I’ll let you go
So I’ll just be lonely without you

[Post-Chorus]
And I miss you, but I’ll let you go
So I’ll just be lonely without you

[Outro]
Yeah, I’ve been feeling…"

Slipping Through My Fingers,72,Declan McKenna,"Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go?
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile"
Cowboy Songs,16,George Birge,"I don't come here much but she loves this place
And I've gotta find her
I don't smoke but she does when drinks
So I've got a lighter
I like whiskey, she likes tequila
So I take one of both
Just in case she walks in, I'll be good to go
She only dances to cowboy songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Don't wanna leave 'til it's closing
So I've got a twenty on the jukebox
to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where
I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only dances to cowboy songs
She only dances to cowboy songs
(she only dances to cowboy songs)
Yeah, she makes love like an ember in the rain
Just something about her
One night with her'd make anyone think
They can't live without her
If she rolls through, Three Chords and the Truth
Might get me half a chance
That steel guitar'll steal her heart if anything can
'Cause she only dances to cowboy songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Don't wanna leave 'til it's closing
So I've got a twenty on the jukebox
to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where
I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only dances to cowboy songs
She only dances to cowboy songs
I'll be wasting quarters, waiting for her
Just in case she shows
And I'll be back tomorrow if she don't
She only dances to cowboy songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Know she's leaving with me
when it's closing
So I've got a twenty on the jukebox
to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where
I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only dances to cowboy songs
She only dances to cowboy songs
I don't come here much
but she loves this place
And I've gotta find her"
Colors,991,Amos Lee,"Yesterday i got lost
in the circus
feeling like such a mess
And now I'm down
I'm just hanging on the corner
I can't help but reminisce
Cuz when you're gone
all the colours fade
When you're gone
no new years day parade
You're gone
colours seem to fade
Your mama called she said
thah you're downstairs crying
Feeling like such a mess
Ya i hear ya
in the back ground balling
What happened
to your sweet summer time dress
I know we all
we all got our faults
We get locked in our vaults
and we stay
When you're gone
all the colurs fade
When you're gone
no new years day parade
You're gone
colours seem to fade
colours seem to fade"
Never Grow Up (Taylor's Version),381,Taylor Swift,"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreamin'
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older too
And don't lose the way that you dance
Around in your PJs getting ready for school
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Oh, oh
Don't you ever grow up
Oh (never grow up)
Just never grow up"

Say It To Me Now,"4,987",Glen Hansard,"scratching at the surface now
I'm trying hard to work it out
So much has gone misunderstood
This mystery only leads to doubt
And I didn't understand
When you reached out to
take my hand
And if you have something to say
You'd better say it now
Cause this is what you've
waited for
Your chance to even up the score
And as these shadows
fall on me now
I will somehow
Cause I'm picking up a

And I'm closer than
I've ever been before

Love You Strongly,412,Amy Stroup,"Love changes everything
I see my life in daydreams
Little scenes of you and me
And there you are singing to me
Soft little melodies
On your ukulele
Swinging in the summer breeze
I could think about it
A thousand more times
I could think about you love
The rest of my life
Uh ooh I could
Uh ooh I could
And I know love has
treated you coldly before
Left you lonely
Oh but not anymore
I was made to love you strongly
Time doesn't exist
Melts away in a mist
With the touch of your lips
Oh oh
I could think about it
A thousand more times
I could think about you love
The rest of my life
Uh ooh I could
Uh ooh I could
And I know love has
treated you coldly before
Left you lonely

And the pieces broke
and the people wanted more
And the rugged wheel
is turning another round

Will you come along to the end
Will you ever let us carry on
Swaying like the children
Singled out for praise
The inside out on the open
With the straightest face
As the sad-eyed woman spoke
we missed our chance
The final dying joke caught
in our hands
And the rugged wheel is turning
another round

Will you come along to the end
Will you ever let us carry on

I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
Baby I know that
you've been wondering
Mmm so here goes nothing
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this
life without you
Even though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart
a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking
One of the things
that I've been feeling
Mmm it's time you hear em
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this
life without you
Even though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart
a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this
life without you
Even though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart
a long long time ago
Yeah you had my heart
a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know"
She,929,Ella Grace,"Where does she go
my love with you
The words that she wrote
my love they're new
So while your head is in the sky
And your heart is floating high
She'll paint it blue
What does she give my love
that I don't give
The taste remains on my lips
those times we kissed
So while your head
is floating high
And your heart is in the sky
It's you I'll miss
So while your head is in the sky
And your heart is floating high
It's you I'll miss"
Smoke Signals,"1,319",Phoebe Bridgers,"I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
Walden it with you
Any longer it would have got old
Singing Ace of Spades
when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed
LA's all right
Sleeping in my bed again
And getting in my head
And then walk around
the reservoir
You you must have
been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
One of your eyes is
always half shut
Something happened
when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
How Soon Is Now
in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it
because your dad
Lived in a campground
in the back of a van
You said that song will creep
you out until you're dead
And you must have
been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
I want to live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody else
makes the bed
We'll watch TV
while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind
since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems
I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot gun
Speeding 'cause fuck the cops
And you you must have
been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
I buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking
back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wall"
"The Ballad of the Lonesome Cowboy (From ""Toy Story 4""/Soundtrack Version)",632,Chris Stapleton,"I was a lonesome cowboy
Lonesome as I could be
You came along changed my life
And fixed what was broken in me
I was a lonesome cowboy
I didn't have a friend
Now I got friends
comin' out of my ears
I'll never be lonesome again
You can't be happy
when you're all by yourself
Go on tell me I'm wrong
You're wrong
When someone takes you
down from the shelf
And plays with you some
it's wonderful
Wonderful
I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore
I just found out what love is about
I've never felt this way before
I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore"

Stranger,575,Riley Roth,"You were just a friend
of a friend of a friend at a party
Only knew your name
'cause you wrote it in Sharpie
On your cup gettin'
drunk on Bacardi
At somebody's brother's apartment
Only noticed we were
on the same couch 'cause
You sang the wrong words way
too loud to
My favorite song
so I called you out
Who would have known
it would start with
Three drinks at 2 AM
One Hey nice to meet you
sayin'
What you got goin' on later
How were you ever a stranger
Three words we said too fast
You were just someone
one month back
Now lovin' you's second nature
How wеre you ever a strangеr
How'd I ever look at you
and not see it
You'd be the one
that I'd trust with my secrets
If you had told me that
that weekend
I wouldn't even believe it
Three drinks at 2 AM
One Hey nice to meet you
sayin'
What you got goin' on later
How were you ever a stranger
Three words we said too fast
You were just someone
one month back
Now lovin' you's second nature
How were you ever
how were you ever a stranger
Oh (A stranger)
I never saw us gettin' this close
Honestly I'm not mad at it though
Emotions all under the microscope
There ain't a part of me
you don't know
You were just a friend
of a friend of a friend at a
party (Oh)
Three drinks at 2 AM
One Hey nice to meet you
sayin'
What you got goin' on later
How were you ever a stranger
Three words we said too fast
You were just someone
one month back
Now lovin' you's second nature
How were you ever how were you
ever a stranger
Oh (A stranger a stranger)
A stranger (How were you ever

Traveling Boy (Album Version),"1,273",Art Garfunkel,"Wake up my love
beneath the midday sun
Alone once more alone
This travelin boy
was only passing through
But he will always think of you
One night of love
beside a strange young smile
As warm as I have known
A travelin boy
and only passing through
But one who will always
think of you
Take my place out on the road again
I must do what I must do
Yes I know we were lovers
but a drifter discovers

A travelin boy
and only passing through
But one who will always
think of you
Take my place out on the road again
I must do what I must do
Yes I know we were lovers
but a drifter discovers
That a perfect love won't
always last forever
I won't say that I'll be back again
Cause time alone will tell
So no goodbyes
for one just passing through
But one who will always
think of you

No goodbyes"
Colour Me In,"2,590",Damien Rice,"I tried to repress it
Then I carried its crown
I reached out to undress it
And love let me down
Love let me down
So I tried to erase it
But the ink bled right through
Almost drove myself crazy
When these words led to you
And all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then colour me in
Well I tried to control it
And cover it up
I reached out to console it
It was never enough
Never enough
So I tried to forget it
That was all part of the show
Told myself I'd regret it
But what do I know
About all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then colour me in
Come let me love you
Come let me take this through the end
Of all these useless dreams of living
In all these useless dreams
All these useless dreams of living
In all these old noes
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me"

More Hearts Than Mine,271,Ingrid Andress,"I can't wait to show you
where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills
of my town
Probably feel like
you've been there before
After hearing all the stories
I've been telling you
For six months now
We'll probably have to sleep
in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church
because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before
we hit the road
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little
faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin' but pretend
that he don't like you
Oh if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more
hearts than mine
My sister's gonna
ask a million questions
Say anything she can
to turn you red
And when you meet
my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights
I can't outlive
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little
faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner but pretend
that he don't like you
Oh if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking
more hearts than mine
Oh
Mmh
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache
I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey
over ice and
Tell a lie and say he
never really liked you
Oh if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more
hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more
hearts than mine"
How Do I Live,645,Trisha Yearwood,"How do I get through
the night without you
If I had to live without you
What kinda life
would that be
Oh I need you in my arms
need you to hold
You're my world
my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything good in my life

Without you
There would be no sun
in my sky
There would be no love
in my life
There would be no world
left for me
And I baby
I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live

If you ever leave
Baby you would
take away everything
Need you with me
Baby don't you know
that you are
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live
How do I live without you"
Time After Time,"1,564",Eva Cassidy,"Lying in my bed I hear
the clock tick and think of you
Turning in circles confusion
is nothing new
Flashback - warm nights - almost
left behind
Suitcases of memories time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you said
Then you say go slow -
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
After your picture fades
and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
I'm wondering if you're OK
You said go slow - I fall behind
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time"
Beer Can’t Fix (Feat. Jon Pardi),752,Thomas Rhett,"You're all alone at a party
you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight
and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags
It could be rainin'
on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed
about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me
but all I'm sayin'
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment
that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds
look a little less gray
Oh you could be lonely
or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown
into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing
that a beer can't fix
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin'
is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin'
watchin' your team losin'
that championship ring
And you're feelin
like life ain't fair
It could be rainin'
on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed
about your work situation
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain
it can't wash away
From the moment
that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds
look a little less gray
Oh you could be lonely
heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown
into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Yeehaw
It could be rainin'
on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed
about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it
for no special occasion
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain
it can't wash away no
From the moment
that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds
look a little less gray
Oh you could be lonely
Lonely
Heartbroken
Heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown
into a smile real quick
So quick
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down
it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix"
"Sometimes It's Something, Sometimes It's Nothing at All",228,Passenger,"Maybe we'll sleep here
Covered in star shine
Out on the ocean
Wrapped up in night-time song
Hear the tide rise and fall
Well sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all
Perhaps we'll wake here
Soaking in sunshine
Dancing on the ocean
Drinking the morning down
Hear the birds cry and call
Well sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all
Oh sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all
Yeah sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all"
Fly,28,Jean Tan,"Fly to your open skies
Alive with fire
So burning bright

Fly on your wings up high

Oh with all your might
See the world

Wild whirl
A wild whirl
A child's world awaits
A while more
Soon you'll find the magic
You were meant to see
Were meant to be
Fly take your leave ignite
Free those wings
Oh butterfly
See the world
See the world
Fly go on dare defy
Trembling tide
in the dark of night
See the world
See the world
Wild whirl
A wild whirl
A child's world awaits
A while more
Soon you'll find the magic
You were meant to see
Were meant to be
Fly don't you cry
Look up high
Your skies are alive
Try you'll be fine
Years gone by
Are coming back to you
Before your very eyes
Fly take your leave ignite
Free those wings
Oh butterfly
See the world
See the world
See the world
See the world
See the world
See the world"
"All Is Found (Lullaby Ending) (From ""Frozen 2""/Outtake)","3,341",Evan Rachel Wood,"Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep my darling safe and sound
For in this river all is found
In her waters deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far
or you'll be drowned
Yes she will sing
to those who'll hear
And in her song all magic flows
But can you brave
what you most fear
Can you face what the river knows
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come my darling homeward bound
When all is lost
then all is found"
Portals,48,Katy Kirby,"I'm an alternate universe in Target lingerie
You're a country song in three-four time
I can see through time in on a clear day
Tastes like black grape and chlorine
And something else that I can't name
Maybe I could describe it
Unless you make me, I won't say
Say, say

[Chorus]
If we peel apart
Will we be stronger than we were before
We had formed ourselves together
In a temporary whole?
And if wе reunite, will we still know
Thе things that we had learned before?
We're not boxes, doors, or borders
We were portals

[Verse 2]
Our arms form a circle
And sometimes when they take that shape
Suddenly I'm in a tunnel
Headed to another state
You're a hand punched through a pane of glass
To get the handle on the other side
Yeah, we're cut on the knuckles
But at least we're open wide
Wide, wide

[Chorus]
If we peel apart
Will we be stronger than we were before
We had formed ourselves together
In a temporary whole?
And if we reunite, will we still know
The things that we had learned before?
We're not boxes, doors, or borders
We were portals"
Love Is A Lonely Thing (Feat. Feist),456,Kings Of Convenience,"If you want someone
to enter in your life
Show a part of your world
they can dream about
It will seem a fair idea
If you make it their idea
Go back to your corner
Let them come to you
Patience is the hardest thing
to have to learn
Hours seem like oceans
when desire burns
Rushing in will ruin all
you must bide your time
Sow a seed in water
wait for love to grow
Love to you is given
love is gifted you
No love can be taken
that love is not true
Love is pain and suffering
love can bе a lonely thing
Once you've known that magic
who can livе without it"
Treacherous (Taylor's Version),640,Taylor Swift,"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I would follow you
follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I I-I-I I-I-I
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I would follow you
follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it"
Will Anybody Ever Love Me?,59,Sufjan Stevens,"Chase away my heart and heartache
Run me over, throw me over, cast me out
Find a river running to the west wind
Just above the shoreline
You will see a cloud


Tie me to a tiny wooden raft
Burn my body, point me to the undertow
Push me off into the void at last
Watch me drift and watch me struggle
let me go... ’cause I really wanna know:


Will anybody ever love me?
For good reasons
Without grievance, not for sport
Will anybody ever love me?
In every season
Pledge allegiance to my heart
Pledge allegiance to my burning heart


Hello wildness please forgive me now
For the heartache and the misery I create
Take my suffering as I take my vow
Wash me now, anoint me
With that golden blade


Tie me to the final wooden stake
Burn my body, celebrate the afterglow
Wash away the summer sins I made
Watch me drift and
Watch me struggle, let me go
’cause I really wanna know:


Will anybody ever love me?
For good reasons
Without grievance, not for sport
Will anybody ever love me?
In every season
Pledge allegiance to my heart
Pledge allegiance to my burning heart"
Dear John (Taylor's Version),355,Taylor Swift,"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
I should've known
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known
You are an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known"
Mean (Taylor's Version),426,Taylor Swift,"You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out, 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"
Haunted (Taylor's Version),410,Taylor Swift,"You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"
Over And Over,819,Nana Mouskouri,"I never dare

to reach for the moon

I never thought

I'd know heaven so soon

I couldn't hope to say

how I feel

The joy in my heart

no words can reveal

Over and over

I whisper your name

Over and over

I kiss you again

I see the light of

love in your eyes

Love is forever

no more goodbyes

Now just a memory

the tears that I cried

Now just a memory

the sighs that I sighed

Dreams that I cherished

all have come true

All my tomorrows

I give to you

Over and over

I whisper your name

Over and over

I kiss you again

I see the light of

love in your eyes

Love is forever

no more goodbyes



Life's summer leaves may

turn into gold

The love that we

share will never grow old

Here in your arms

no words far away

Here in your arms

forever I'll stay

Over and over

I whisper your name

Over and over

I kiss you again

I see the light of

love in your eyes

Love is forever

no more goodbyes

Over and over

I whisper your name

Over and over

I kiss you again

I see the light of

love in your eyes

Love is forever

no more goodbyes

The Gambler,201,Kenny Rogers,"On a warm summer's eve
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us,
he began to speak
He said, Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind me sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice
So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his faced lost all expression
He said, If you're gonna
play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
And in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
You've got to know when to hold 'em
When to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
When to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done"
Baby! It's Christmas,804,Jessie James Decker,"It's that time again

to be together again
The snow is falling

Weather Any Storm,268,Cody Francis,"When we wake
Hear the birds and see the sun
Side by side our fears are done
Oh the the good times just begun
Oh, we know what we have
Let's hold on tight
Found what we're looking for in life
Call us crazy but things are finally right
With you and I the future is bright
Oh, you and I we got it
Oh, we don't need no more
Oh, even in the hard times
You and I can weather any storm
Before sleep
Hear the crickets, see the moon
Side by side and through and through
No limit to what we can do
Oh, we know what we have
Let's hold on tight
Found what we're looking for in life
Call us crazy but things are finally right
With you and I the future is bright
Oh, you and I we got it

Love Is No Big Truth,"1,237",Kings Of Convenience,"All I do is sleep all day,

and think of you.

A memory of the cushion life

I'm clinging to.

The image of a mutual one, our haven.

The sombre chords of our song,

the fading.

Love is no big truth,

driven by our genes,

we are simple selfish beings.

A symphony that's you,

joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping.

Passion and its brother hate,

they come and go.

Could easily be made

to stay for longer though.

Many people play this game

so willingly,

do I have to be like them,

or be lonely?

Love is no big truth,

driven by our genes,

we are simple selfish beings.

A symphony that's you,

joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping.

another view of what there is to it,

getting me through it

I'll never need it again. not again, not again..."
Never Grow Up,"2,048",Taylor Swift,"Your little hands wrapped
around my finger And it's
so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter
cause you're dreaming So I
tuck you in and turn on
your favorite night light
To you everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Never grow up

You're in the car
on the way to the movies And you're
mortified your mama's
dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much
you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don't make
her drop you off around the block
Remember she's getting older too
And don't
lose the way that you dance
around in your PJs
getting ready for school
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
No one's ever burned
Nothing's ever left you scarred
Even though you want to
just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of
your childhood room
Memorize what is sounded like
what your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps
remember the words said
And all your little brother's
favorite songs
I just realized everything
I had is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city
they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I
thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and
turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up

I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heat
And even throuhg toyu want to
please try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up

Just never grow up"
If This Was A Movie,"3,604",Taylor Swift,"Last night I heard my own
heart beating
Sounded like footsteps
on my stairs
Six months gone and
I'm still reaching
Even though I know
you're not there
I was playing back a thousand
memories baby
Thinkin bout everything
we've been through
Maybe i've been going back
too much lately
When time stood still
and I had you
Come back come back come back
to me like
You would you would
if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til
I came out
Come back come back come back
to me like
You could you could if you
just said you're sorry
I know that we can work it
out somehow
But if this was a movie
you'd be here by now

I know people change and
these things happen
But I remember how
it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our
friends are laughing
Cause nothing like
this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down your street
Flashback to the night
when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not
for me and you
Not before I knew how much
I had to lose
Come back come back come back
to me like
You would you would if
this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til
i came out
Come back come back come back
to me like
You could you could if you
just said you're sorry
I know that we can work it
out somehow
But if this was a movie
you'd be here by now

If you're out there
if you're somewhere
if you're moving on
I've be waiting for you ever
since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it
was before
And i just wanna see you back
at my front door
And i'd say
Come back come back come back
to me like
You would before you said its
not that easy
Before the fight before
i locked you out
But i'd take it all back now
Come back come back come back
to me like
You would you would if
this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside
til i came out
Come back come back come back
to me like
You could you could if you
just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it
out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd

You'd be here by now

All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version) - Recorded at Long Pond Studios,754,Taylor Swift,"I walked through the door with you,
the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it
felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf
there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car,
getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down
like pieces into place
And I can picture it
after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay,
but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again
on that little town street
You almost ran the red
'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter,
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid
with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories
'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past,
thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys,
""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground,
we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down,
""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,""
you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back
swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered
where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and
you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again
in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again
when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret,
but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well,
oh-oh-oh-oh
And maybe
we got lost in translation,
maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name
of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece
of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well,
but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age,
maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy,
ever-lovely jewel whose shine
reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me
what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad
with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like
you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me
watch the front door all night,
willin' you to come
And he said,
""It's supposed to be fun
turning twenty-one""
Time won't fly,
it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again,
but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of
innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it
all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again
when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one
real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good
at tellin' jokes,
but the punch line goes
""I'll get older,
but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn
broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning
half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise
paint you blue?
Just between us,
did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first
fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us,
did the love affair
maim you all too well?
Just between us,
do you remember it all too well?
Just between us,
I remember it (Just between us)
all too well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair,
I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs,
I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer,
I was there, I was there
It was rare,
you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair,
I was there, I was there
Down the stairs,
I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer,
I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
(All too well)
Wind in my hair,
I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs,
I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer,
I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"
Give Me One Reason,975,Tracy Chapman,"* Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want to leave you lonely
You gotta make me change my mind *

Baby I got your number
Oh I know that you got mine
You know that I called you
I called too many times
You can call me baby
You can call me anytime
You got to call me

** Repeat

I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me
Oh and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you
And soon give you what you need
I said youthful heart can love you
Oh and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

** Repeat

Baby just give me one reason
Oh give me just one reason why
Baby just give give me one reason
Oh give me just one reason
Why I should stay
Said I told you that I loved you
And there ain't no more to say"
Shiver,"1,796",Lucy Rose,"We broke
Everything that was right
We both enjoyed a good fight
And we solved
All the holes we had to breathe
To make the other one leave
And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone
So I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you
And we stole
Every moment we had to
make the other one feel bad
And we hoped that
we could be what we knew
We'd never turn out to be real
And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone
And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn
And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you
Like I used to"
The A Team,"1,062",Ed Sheeran,"White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

The worst things in life come free to us

And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
For angels to die"
Words,437,Gregory Alan Isakov,"words mean more at night
like a song
and did you ever notice
the way light means
more than it did all day long?
words mean more at night
light means more
like your hair and your face
and your smile
and our bed and the dress
that you wore
so i’ll send you my words
from the corners of my room
and though i write them
by the light of day
please read them
by the light of the moon
and i wish i could leave
my bones and my skin
and float over the tired tired sea
so that i could see you again
maybe you would leave too
and we’d blindly pass each other
floating over the ocean blue
just to find the warm bed
of our lover
and i’ll send you my words
from the corners of my room
and though i write them
by the light of day
please read them
by the light of the moon"
I Can't Make You Love Me,"2,003",Dave Thomas Junior,"Turn down the lights
turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
inside my head
Lay down with me
tell me no lies
Just hold me close
don't patronize
Don't patronize me
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't
You can't make your heart
feel something it won't
Here in the dark
in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
and I'll feel the power
But you won't
no you won't
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't
I'll close my eyes
then I won't see
The love you don't feel
when you're holding me
Morning will come and
I'll do what's right
Just give me
till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't
You can't make your heart
feel something it won't
Here in the dark
in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and
I'll feel the power
But you won't
no you won't
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't"
The Last/The First,15,Martti Franca,"Have you ever tried
Have you ever tried to be
Six feet away from
Your favorite place on earth
But you couldn’t find
But you couldn’t find it in you
To go back in there
Cause when she left
She took the air with her
You don’t wanna know
You don’t wanna know how it feels
When it's coming out of nowhere
Everybody knows
Everybody knows how she feels
Before she said that it was over
Oh all my life
I’ve been the one who fights
For every love I’ve had
It all ends the same
no matter how hard I try
Why am I the last to say goodbye
Have you every tried
Have you ever tried to see
What their lives would be like
If you disappeared from
everyone you loved
And would they even
feel the change
Like you did
when you watched your family
Thirty thousand feet above the sky
Cause when they left
they took the air with them
Pressure in their ears as they fly
All my years
I've tried to stop these tears
For every friend I've lost
It all ends the same
Now all my tears are dry
Why am I the first to say goodbye
All my life
I've been the one who hides
From every pain unknown
But it all ends the same
Am I meant to be alone
Why am I the first
Why am I the last
To say goodbye"
High Tide,200,Josh Tobias,"you had a bad dream
had a bad dream again
a storm was raging but I
wasn't there to hold your hand
but I promise the moment
you open your eyes
I'll be by your side
you know I love you
I tell you everyday
but you say that love won't
it won't wash away your pain
but I promise the moment
the tides roll out
we'll find higher ground"
Rumours,562,Kings Of Convenience,"I heard them whisper and say
Bad things about you
accusations we both know are wrong
It's not true what they say about you
It's not true what they say about you
I know you as generous and kind
They were blind with the injustice
of this crazy world
I know you as humble and fair
How can anyone expect you to
Solve all the problems
addressed to you
They had too many
and your arms too few
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are
Don't let thеm tell you
don't let them tеll you who you are
I heard them calling your name
In a way that's supposed to
make you feel bad
For the mess your father made
They want to open your wounds again
Turn the eyes of the world away
From their own well hidden crimes
I want to tell you that I love you
But I know you can't hear me now
I know you can't hear me now
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are
Don't let them tell you
don't let them tell you who you are"

Heartbroken,207,Diplo,"Used to pray for rain just to stay inside
You wouldn’t believe it,
every move I made I was terrified
Thought that every road
I took had a bitter end

I just couldn’t see it
I convinced myself trying to trust again

Would be like trying to
make a river run upstream
Trying to make a mountain into a valley
That’s what your love does to me
You make me feel…
Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closing
Like I never watched love run away on fire
in the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rolling
Like I never said here’s hoping
I could find me someone whose
good at being real
Who can make me feel wide open
Like I never had my heart broken

You make me feel like
I’ve never been too much to handle
Roll the dice you know love is a gamble
Feel like I always had the poorest examples

Like fire in your heart
I’m tryin to relight that candle
My cinderella,
no questioning this shit forever
Pain in written letters,
sheddin’ tears while we sit together
Forget the pressure, know
I love hard I’m sick of lectures
Stuck in rainstorms
I could get used to this different weather
Broken pieces that was all I had,
girl I promise now you all I got

Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closing
Like I never watched love run away on fire
in the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rolling
Like I never said here’s hoping
I could find me someone whose
good at being real
Who can make me feel wide open
Like I never had my heart broken

Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closing
Like I never watched love run away on fire
in the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rollin
Like I never said here’s hoping
I could find me someone whose
good at bein real
Who can make me feel wide open
Like I never had my heart broken"

Love Story,592,Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
The Sound Of Silence (single version),114,Simon & Garfunkel,"Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while
I was sleeping
And the vision
that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar
to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs
that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
'Fools' said I
'You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that
I might teach you
Take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words like
silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed
out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said
'The words of
the prophets are written
on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd
in the sounds of silence"
Lies,"4,065",Glen Hansard,"I think it's time, we give it up
And figure out what's stopping us
From breathing easy and talking straight
The way is clear if you're ready now
The volunteer is slowing down
And taking time to save himself
The little cracks they escalated
before you knew it was too late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Baby, if you slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
The little cracks they escalated
And before you knew it was too late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you'd slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
So plant the thought and watch it grow
Wind it up and let it go"

Donna Donna,423,Joan Baez,"On a wagon bound for market
There's a calf with a mournful eye
High above him, there's a swallow
Winging swiftly through the sky
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer's night
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna
Donna, Donna, Donna, Don
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna
Donna, Donna, Donna, Don
""Stop complaining!"" said the farmer
""Who told you a calf to be?
Why don't you have wings to fly with
Like the swallow so proud and free?""
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer's night
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna
Donna, Donna, Donna, Don
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna
Donna, Donna, Donna, Don
Calves are easily bound and slaughtered
Never knowing the reason why
But whoever treasures freedom
Like the swallow has learned to fly
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer's night
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna

homecoming queen?,206,Kelsea Ballerini,"Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot
forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
But what if I told you
the world wouldn't end
If you started showing
what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in
on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Oh
Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtain's closed?
Did your Daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama
Sweep it under the rug?
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot
forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
What if I told you
the world wouldn't end
If you started showing
what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in
on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you
the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure,
said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles
and shines
And even the homecoming
queen cries (Ooh)
Oh yeah (Ooh)
Even the homecoming
queen cries (Ooh)
Mmm-mmm, mmm (Ooh)
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?"

Shallow,21,Jada Facer,"Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world
Or do you need more
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void
Or do you need more
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

The Feeling Is All Gone,57,Chase McBride,"There is a life I lead in this city
Hurrying to cut my teeth
I can take what I need to get by
Doesn’t make it easy
The other piece of my heart is slow
Somewhere in the great unknown
When I return from the afterglow
Will you carry me like I am whole again?

Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone

Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone
(The feeling is all gone)
(The feeling is all gone)

If I could take you back to my youth
Show you what I wish I knew
My will is strong with a place to lead
In the moment I hung disbelief
The other ring on my wrist is gold
Fairing with the lie we pulled
When I return from my spinning dome
I’m rememberin' the words you told me

Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone

Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone
(The feeling is all gone)
(The feeling is all gone)
(The feeling is all gone)

Or am I really lying here with you?
Baby, you take me in your arms
And though I'm wide awake,
I know my dream is comin' true
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then
it happens every time
There I go by,
just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
Magic, it must be magic
The way I hold you
when the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment
when I look into your eyes.
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then
it happens every time
There I go by,
just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you"
Motion Sickness,834,Phoebe Bridgers,"I hate you for what you did
and I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time
but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all
You gave me fifteen hundred
to see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time
you let it slide
fell on hard times a year ago
was hoping you would
let it go and you did
I have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
There are no words
in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks
around your room
and while you're bleeding
on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
and sorry that it all
went down like it did
I have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
There are no words
in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
And why do you sing
with an English accent
I guess it's too late
to change it now
You know I'm never
gonna let you have it
but I will try to drown you out
You said when you
met me you were bored
You said when you
met me you were bored
And you you were
in a band when I was born
I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean
and live without
and I want to know
what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound"

Something Stupid (Album Version),24,The Secret Sisters,"I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid
Like: ""I love you""

I can see it in your eyes
That you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day
To find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait
Until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you

The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red
And oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid
Like: ""I love you""

The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red
And oh, the night's so blue

Soon as you came walkin' in
'Cause here I am here we are

Maybe I'm weak

That I keep moving closer

Better than just because

You All Over Me (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault) (Feat. Maren Morris),"2,240",Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Verse 2]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
But I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around
And see that we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried, and I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Outro]
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me"
Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version),672,Taylor Swift,"You said it in a simple way
4 AM the second day
How strange that
I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane
that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but
wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
This is falling in love
in the cruellest way
This is falling for you
when you are worlds away
In New York be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that
you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
Oh-oh oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh oh-oh
Come back be here
Come back be here"

I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
A dragonfly heard the message
darkness was home for the start
it spread its wings to the surface
bright colours set them apart
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am"
Something in the Orange,241,Zach Bryan,"It’ll be fine by dusk light
I’m telling you baby
These things eat at your bones
and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head
between my collar and jaw
I don’t know much
but there’s no weight at all
And I’m damned if I do and
I’m damned if I don’t
‘Cause if I say I miss you
I know that you won’t
But I miss you in the mornings
when I see the sun
Something in the orange tells me
we’re not done
To you I’m just a man,
to me you’re all I am
Where the hell am I ‘supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me
you’re never coming home
I need to hear you say
you’ve been waitin’ all night
There’s orange dancing
in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles
when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancing
this wood used to creak
To you I’m just a man,
to me you’re all I am
Where the hell am I ‘supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me
you’re never coming home
To you I’m just a man,
to me you’re all I am
Where the hell am I ‘supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me
you’re never coming home
If you leave today I’ll
just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
Grass trees and dew,
how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around"
Neon Cowgirl,78,Dan + Shay,"I see you drinking alone
All by yourself in the corner
And that just ain't right
You should be out on the floor
The cover band singing for ya
Having the time of your life

I don't know what he did
But I can tell you this
Ain't worth the tears in your eyes

Neon cowgirl
Don't you cry
Don't you know you were born to shine
Rain stops falling
Hearts unbreak
So let that cowboy ride away
It won't be like this forever
Ain't no storm that you can't weather
Neon cowgirl
Don't you cry

That pair of boots you got on
They should be taking you dancing
Under these broadway lights
You oughta know that you're stronger
Than the drink in your hand is
So hold your head up high

Way you light up a room
Don't know what kinda fool
Could ever tell you goodbye

Neon cowgirl
Don't you cry
Don't you know you were born to shine
Rain stops falling
Hearts unbreak
So let that cowboy ride away
It won't be like this forever
Ain't no storm that you can't weather
Neon cowgirl
Don't you cry

I know it's been a while
Since you showed off your smile
And all that blue in your eyes

Neon cowgirl
Don't you cry
Don't you know you were born to shine
Rain stops falling
And hearts unbreak
So let that cowboy ride away
It won't be like this forever
Ain't no storm that you can't weather
Neon cowgirl
Don't you cry

Don't you cry
Neon cowgirl, don't you cry"

No Caller ID,38,Megan Moroney,"I'm two months deep in therapy
Been finally getting sleep
My friends quit checking up on me
'Cause I'm back on my feet
I'm doing more than getting by
Ive been seeing a stand-up guy
It's the middle of the night
And my phone starts ringing and

Here you come again, and there you go
No coincidence, you always know
When I'm moving on, you move back in
With a half-ass, ""Sorry, how you been?""
Why do you do it? Do you just hate losing?
Here you come again, who could it be
It's 3 a.m., no caller ID

I don't need to see your name
Who else would drunk-call me this late?
Surprise, surprise, you haven't changed
I'm sure, you're sure I'll pick up
And I shouldn't want to, but I do
You know me too well, damn you
Why do I want to? I shouldn't want to

Well, here you come again, and there you go
No coincidence, you always know
When I'm moving on, you move back in
With a half-ass, ""Sorry, how you been?""
Why do you do it? Do you just hate losing?
Here you come again, who could it be?
It's 3 a.m., no caller ID

Don't you get tired of hurting me?
I'm tired of hurting me
I'm tired of hurting me
So I let it ring, I let it ring

Here you come again, and there you go
No coincidence, you always know
When I'm moving on, you move back in
Keep your half-ass, ""Sorry, how you been?""
I know why you do it, you just hate losing
Here you come again, who could it be?
It's just you, no caller ID

It's just you, no caller ID
It's just you, no caller ID"

Tennessee Whiskey,839,Chris Stapleton,"Used to spend my nights
out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love
I'd known
But you rescued me
from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back
from bein' too far gone
You're as smooth
as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet
as strawberry wine
You're as warm
as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned
on your love all the time
I've looked for love
in all the same old places
Found the bottom
of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out
your heart
I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin'
like your love to get me high
And you're as smooth
as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet
as strawberry wine
You're as warm
as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned
on your love all the time
You're as smooth
as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet
as strawberry wine
You're as warm
as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned
on your love all the time
You're as smooth
as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth
as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

Teeth,"1,361",Billie Marten,"It's been a hard time a long day
Our minds they play over
and over again
And I call myself a friend
While you call yourself a stranger
We float upon the hills
and on the grass
Speak words that
they will hear but
never understand
And I'm writing this in a bad way
No one can hear
what my head says
Oh no
take what you want from me
Because I can't bear it
I find it hard to breathe
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think about
it too much
If you ask if I'm fine
then I'd say yes
But I am lying through my teeth
and they all know that
I am flawed
I am flawed
Still you float upon
the hills and on the grass
Dreaming only of the time
that's soon to pass
And I'd say I just exist
in this darken world I live in
Oh no don't come near me
Because I can't bear it
I find it hard to breathe
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think about it too much
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think about it too much"
"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right","1,245",Bob Dylan,"It ain't no use to sit and
wonder why babe
It don't matter anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and
wonder why babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows
at the break of dawn
Look out your window
and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice it's all right
It ain't no use in turnin'
on your light babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin'
on your light babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin'
you would do or say
To try and make me
change my mind and stay
We never did too much
talkin' anyway
So don't think twice it's all right
It ain't no use in callin' out
my name gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out
my name gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin'
all the way down the road
I once loved a woman
a child I'm told
I give her my heart
but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice
it's all right
So long honey babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word babe
So I just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better
but I don't mind
You just kinda
wasted my precious time
But don't think twice it's all right"

i don't even know
what just i'd do if you
found your way back
through clear all the cob
webs that we weaved
making room for you and me
there's a road to my heart
follow signs through
the ride when you see
all the lights glowing bright
you know you found me
looking at the city escape
tiny little bubbles sparkling
in the night i don't think
its ever too late to cut
the ties that bond us to our lies

When Emma Falls in Love (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),402,Taylor Swift,"When Emma falls in love she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love she calls up her mom
Jokes about how this one can go wrong
She waits and takes her time
Cause little miss sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love I know that boy will never be the same


Cause she's the kind of girl that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her


And to tell you the truth, some times I wish I was her


When Emma falls in love it's all in her face
Hangs on her like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
Cause when Emma falls in love she's leadin' for keeps
She won't walk away unless she absolutely have to leave


Cause she's the kind of girl that you can't put down


Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, some times I wish I was her


And she's so muttered when she's in LA
She ran through herself and love the way I did
And she'll call you out, she put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm lovin' it
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hands
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know his whole world's about to change




Cause she's the kind of girl that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, some times I wish I was her


Yeah between me and you, some times I wish I was her"
Older Chests,908,Damien Rice,"older chests reveal themselves
like a crack in a wall
starting small and grow in time
and we always seem
to need the help
of someome else
to mend that shelf
too many books
read me your favorite line
papa want to other ladns
and he found someone
who understands
the ticking and the western
man's need to cry
he came back
the other day you know
some things in life may change
and some things
they stay the same
like time there's always time
on my my mind
so pass me by i'll be fine
just give me time
older gents sit on the fence
with their cap in hand
looking grand
they watch their city change
children scream or so it seems
louder than before
our of doors and into stores
with bigger names
mama tried to wash their faces
but these kids
they lost their graces
and daddy lost at the races
too many times
she broke down the other day
yeah you know
some things in life may change
but some things they stay the same
like time there is always time
on my mind
so pass me by i'll be fine
just give me times
times there's always time
on my mind
pass me by i'll be fine
just give me time"
"You Need Me, I Don't Need You","1,947",Ed Sheeran,"Now I'm in town
break it down
thinking of
making a new sound
Playing a different show
every night
in front of a new crowd
That's you now
ciao seems that
life is great now
See me lose focus
as I sing to you loud
I can't no
I won't hush
I say the words
that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See I'm true
my songs are where
my heart is
I'm like glue
I stick to other artists
I'm not you
now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
and move to greener pastures
See I'm real I do it all
it's all me
I'm not fake
don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put
give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to
sort of suffocate me
'Cos you need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing I write my own tune
and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith
to make the tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer
you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits
and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast
I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and
I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with
the way I act right
I can't last
if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a
product of my genre
My mind will always
be stronger
than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit
that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories
that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically
I'm demonstrating
When I perform live feels like
I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise
when some fella filmed me
Young singer writer
like a Gabriella Cilmi
'Cos you need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me
'Cos with the lyrics
I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till
my name is in lights
At stadium heights
with Damien Rice
on red carpets
now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young
I know my brother's
gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height
and I'm going hyper
Never be anything
but a singer songwriter
Yeah the game's over
but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track
without a loop pedal
People think that
I'm bound to blow up
I've done around
about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus
I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics
when I'm singing them out
From day one
I've been prepared
with VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
giving a dose of
what the future holds
'Cos it's another day
plus I keep
my last name forever
keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking
into other people's tunes
when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant
in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes
using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack
aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rushsack
aiming for majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack
still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor
for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy
in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace
and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows
if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke never growing up
call me Rufio
Melody music maker
reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like
I'm fucking in an elevator
'Cos you need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you"
Forever & Always (Taylor’s Version),830,Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that
cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
but I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so
Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah"

Blowin' In The Wind,255,Bob Dylan,"How many roads
must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
How many seas must
a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand
Yes n how many times
must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned
The answer my friend
is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes n how many years
can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea
Yes n how many years
can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free
Yes n how many times
can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see
The answer my friend
is blowin’ in the wind
The answer is blowin’ in the wind
Yes n how many times
must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
Yes n how many ears
must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
Yes n how many deaths
will it take till he knows
that too many people have died
The answer my friend
is blowin’ in the wind
The answer is blowin’ in the wind"

Those Were The Days (2010 - Remaster),655,Mary Hopkin,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed
away the hours
And dreamed of
all the great things we would do
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and
sure to have our way
La la la la
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days
oh yes those were the days
La la la la
Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days
oh yes those were the days
La la la la
Through the door there
came familiar laughter
I saw your face and
heard you call my name
Oh my friend
we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts
the dreams are still the same
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days
oh yes those were the days

Wasn't Expecting That,"1,882",Jamie Lawson,"It was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't expecting that
Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed
I wasn't expecting that
Did I misread the sign
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that
You spent the night in my bed
You woke up and you said
Well I wasn't expecting that
I thought love wasn't meant to last
I thought you were
just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve
somebody like you
I wasn't expecting that
It was only a word
It was almost misheard
I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't expecting that
I thought love wasn't meant to last
Honey I thought you were
just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve
somebody like you
I wasn't expecting that
Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed
If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
I wasn't expecting that
When the nurses they came
Said It's come back again
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by surprise
I wasn't expecting that"
Bad Apple,"1,230",Billie Marten,"Well I just like to sing
Forget everything and
write of colour and string
Talk of life in the sea
And none of that will
ever be healthy for society
Mmm
Teacher tell us when
people hurt the people
every now and then
What’s that all about
Hiding one another
finding no way out
What a time what a time
Mmm
Who am I honey riddle me that
How can I say what’s
white and what’s black
Who am I
got some knuckles to crack
Everybody’s riding on my back
She said life is like this fruit
Wholesome
good and green at the root
But if it drops to the floor
What you get is bruises
and a love of a rotten
core-ore-ore-ore ah-ah-ah-ah-mm
Core-ore-ore-ore ah-ah-ah-ah-mm
Who am I honey riddle me that
How can I say what’s
white and what’s black
Who am I
got some knuckles to crack
Everybody’s riding on my back
Wearing animal skin
With no state to be in
Choosing good over sin
How sweet
Wearing animal skin
With no state to be in
Choosing good over sin
How sweet"
Float Back To You,356,Holy Hive,"Hold my breath, never check the time
My heart beats when I stand in line
Waitin' on the sun to fall behind
Movin' to the place where we unwind
Blinking streetlights blurring by
Waitin' on the stars to start their climb
On the way back to you
My legs get away from me
Mindin' not a single stair
Floating
Back to you
Tried and true patience cannot be tried
Justice be done, justice, I'm not blind
Let me have the moon fallin' bright
Even evening evens to a dark
Light of lightning, light it with a spark
Let her outline shine out of sight
On the way back to you
My legs get away from me
Mindin' not a single stair
Floating
Back to you
I float back to you"

Floating,406,Chevy,"Am I enough
Or am I just a shame?
Should I go
Or should I stay?
Silence is creeping
Think of something to say
You stutter and mumble
Today's just not your day
They smile and laugh like people do
Yet you're standing there
without clue
I'm floating away
just like a balloon
I'm fit to burst
But they can't see that it's you
They say they'll hold on tight
But is that really the truth?
If I'm let go now
I'll just fade to blue
""How was your day?""
""It was fine I guess""
The words you say
Don't match what's in your head
Do they like me?
Am I their friend?
Or am I a nuisance
They smile and laugh
like people do
Yet you're standing there
without clue
I'm floating away
just like a balloon
I'm fit to burst
But they can't see that it's you
They say they'll hold on tight
But is that really the truth?
If I'm let go now
I'll just fade to blue

Masterpiece,12,Ben Harper,"Could paint the sun and the moon
And the stars straight down from the sky
Carve your likeness in stone
Down to the light that shines in your eyes
Build a church in your honor
Stained glass windows facing east
Loving you
Loving you is my masterpiece
Love you for who you are
I love you for who you may never be
From downtown all the way up to 142nd street
And all of my possessions mean
less than the very least
Loving you
Loving you is my masterpiece
There's no time like now
There is no place like here
So throw your loving arms around me, dear
And I'll lean on you like a beggar
Leans upon the moonlit streets
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you is my masterpiece"
Ours (Taylor’s Version),321,Taylor Swift,"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"

The Way I Loved You,"1,570",Taylor Swift,"He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are
jealous He says everything
I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful
tonight And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and
I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act
insane And that's the way I
loved you Breakin' down
and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel
that much And that's
the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly
when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling
anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated got away
by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting
and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Of all the girls tossing
rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting

And pull me near and shine

I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls well

But would they write a song for you

I can't help it
if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss
you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you

"Take Me Home, Country Roads",548,John Denver,"Almost heaven, West Virginia,

Blue Ridge Mountains

Shenandoah River.

Life is old there,

Older than the trees,

Younger than the mountains

browin' like a breeze.



Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong:

West Virginia, mountain momma,

Take me home, country roads.



All my memories gather round her,

Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,

Misty taste of moonshine,

Teardrop in my eye.



Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain momma,

Take me home, country roads.



I hear her voice, in the morning how she calls me,

Radio reminds me of my home far away

And drivin'down the road I get a feelin'

I should been home yesterday, yesterday





Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain momma,

Take me home, country roads.

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain momma,

Take me home, country roads.

Take me home, country roads."
Can't Ask For More (Feat. Melissa Polinar) (JTBC '효리네 민박' 1회 삽입곡),"1,255",Alvin Ordonez,"Another day goes by
Without the ones left behind
Those days were
swallowed by the nights
When I was lost in thought
with you in my mind
So just take my hand
and let's run away
Yeah that'll be the day
When I find my soul mate
So baby please just
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's as beautiful
or as compatible
Can't get enough of this life
it's so wonderful
Nothing's as wonderful as you
Everyday I just can't wait to
see you in the morning
and in the afternoon
Or catch you during your break
and we can share a drink or two
Since you were away
I had to find some things to do
So I wrote this song dedicated to you
The sight of you just
makes my heartbeat stop
You got me shaking
I'm not faking I'm about to drop
Oh I'm about to drop
So baby please just
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's as beautiful
or as compatible
Can't get enough of this life
it's so wonderful
Nothing's as wonderful as you
Baby you've got my heart knocking
You got me head over heels
there ain't no stopping us now
there ain't no stopping us now
'Cause you know you're everything
I need and more
I can't ask for more
So baby please just
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's as beautiful
or as compatible
Can't get enough of this life
it's so wonderful
Nothing's as wonderful
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's as beautiful

Can't get enough of this life

Tequila (Live in Aspen),497,Music Travel Love,"I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little scotch on the rocks
And I'm fine I'm fine
But when I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor
in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
you lips pressed
against the bottle
Swearing on a bible baby
I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby your memory
It only hits me this hard
But when I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor
in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
you lips pressed
against the bottle
Swearing on a bible baby
I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila
Oo ohh
When I taste tequila
I ain't even drunk
I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love
How I need your love
Yes it sinks me
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
But when I taste tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor
in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado
you lips pressed
against the bottle
Swearing on a bible baby
I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya

And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through
In everything you do

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight

I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize

My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize

Verse 1
Repeat the cycle every day, I gotta start with a drink
My life been getting sorta crazy and I don't wanna think
I look myself right in the mirror and I don't even blink
Then I get angry, take the rest and pour it right in the sink
I know where this road goes
Alcohol ain't my friend, but I keep drinkin' 'cause these demons roam
And follow me 'round everywhere I go
It clouds my mind and soul, it turns my heart cold
But I keep drinkin' 'cause it makes me feel like I'm not alone
I'm havin' problems, my pride won't let me reach out
Lookin' at this bottle, havin' nothin' but doubt
Don't wanna drink, but it keeps comin' around and around and around

Chorus
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize

Verse 2
I know I need to quit I need to quit
I gotta do better I gotta do better
Example to these kids Example to these kids
'Cause they watchin' when I'm in there, but I'm scared
'Cause I've been chasin' the man that I am when I start to drink
He's cocky, confident and he don't give a damn what you think
This world is beatin' me down, it has pushed me right to the brink
I take a shot every time because man it helps me escape
I'm takin' care of these people, but no one takes care of me
I wanna talk to somebody, but I feel no one relates
I need better now, I think I've lost my way
I'm havin' battles with faith, it's painted right on my face
I hope better times are comin', no chase but I'm still runnin'
I gotta take control, and I won't stop for nothin'
Dear God, this is my test, promise that I'll do my best
Just help me with this pain I feel and pressure that is on my chest

Castles Crumbling (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault) (Feat. Hayley Williams),371,Taylor Swift,"Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh (Ah, ah)
Ooh (Ah, ah)
Ooh
My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screaming at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me
My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me
I will just let you down
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now"

Lake Shore Drive,266,Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah,"There's a road I'd like to tell you about,
lives in my hometown
Lake Shore Drive the road is called
and it'll take you up or down
From rats on up to riches,
fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along
the way help you right on by
And the blue lights shining
with a heavenly grace
help you right on by
And there ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive
heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday night trouble bound
And it starts up north from Hollywood,
water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up,
throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green
if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be
than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind
or place you see riding
on Lake Shore Drive
And there ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive
heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday night trouble bound
And it's Friday night
and you're looking clean,
too early to start the rounds
A ten-minute ride
from the Gold Coast back,
make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning
and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind
and Lake Shore Drive,
tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine
in the morning time,
tomorrow is another day
Woo
And there ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive
heading into town
Just snaking on by on LSD,
Friday night trouble bound"
Innocent (Taylor's Version),279,Taylor Swift,"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Everyone of us has messed up too, ooh, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back"
Come Rain or Come Shine,739,Eric Clapton,"I'm gonna love you
like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
Well I guess when you met me

You're gonna love me

And we'll build this love from the ground up
This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn't wanna spend it
without you by my side

Through the wind and the rain
And we'll build this love from the ground up

'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
I was not born to drown
baby come on

We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she wakes
We'll have driven through
the state
We'll have driven through
the night
baby come on
If the sun don't shine
on me today
And if the subways
flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down
and dig your grave
Or will you rail against
your dying day
And when we looked outside
couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent
is it your parents
Or is hard work dear
holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that
If the sun don't shine
on me today
If the subways flood and
bridges break
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight

So I Don't Let Me Down,258,Clinton Kane,"Trying not to hold in my safety
Prisoner to my miracle save me
From the roof
that I built myself gave me
Only thing
that I didn't want more of
Was the feeling
I couldn't escape it
Waiting tables
at a minute complaining
That the phone would start ringing
But lately
My soul's
Looking for a better way to deal
with all the little changes
That keep freaking me out
Wouldn't hurt to figure out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
Sitting in the middle of a city
with a million strangers
And it's getting too loud
Wouldn't hurt to figure
out a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
So I don't let me down
And so I don't let me down
Got no time to be overthinking
Can the thoughts
in my head be the demons
That wanna drive me away
from believing
In the things
that I was so sure of
Had to lie and defy
Be my savior
Emphasize in the lights
and my failures
Cuz it's not black
and white in this nature
When the plane lands I'm still
Looking for a better way to deal
with all the little changes
That keep freaking me out
Wouldn't hurt to figure out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
Sitting in the middle of a city
with a million strangers
And it's getting too loud
Wouldn't hurt to figure out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
So I don't let me down
And so I don't let me down
So I don't let me down
And so I don't let me
Cuz I keep thinking
When the sun gets better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
And I keep thinking
When the sun gets better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
And oh I keep thinking
When the sun gets better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
And no I can't keep thinking
When the sun gets better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
Cuz I'm still looking for a better
Way to deal
with all the little changes
That keep freaking me out
Wouldn't hurt to figure out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down"
Ask For Help,362,Kings Of Convenience,"If you got the will to do it

But you lack a leader
inside of you

Why is it so crucial who says
if only it gets sung
Why is it so crucial who does

Wouldn't it be nice if you win
To know you couldn't have gotten

I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day,
but tonight I drink
You say I gotta get over you
and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options
and take your pick
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number
out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long

If you want me to quit you,
want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl,
but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories
I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey,
some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop lovin' you?
Hey, what you want me to do?
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out

I can give you up right now

Sorry I haven’t been too good
Your love it means the world the two of you our brotherhood

We can't move your mountains but we can hold your hand

We need you to be brave now, need you to be brave

You wrote you're afraid
The end you cannot see
There is those who'll make a choice
And there is those who'll clasp to ease

Seen all your scars
They color all you’ve done
And thank you for those helping hands
In times when there were none

You don’t need no saving need only to be brave
We can't move your mountains but we can hold your hand
You’ll bloom in health and color with grace you'll come of age
We need you to be brave now, need you to be brave

Please treat yourself kind

Will tell the storm has cleared

Foolish One (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),388,Taylor Swift,"My cards are on the table, yours are in your hands
Chances are tonight you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head


And the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson,"" foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down


You know how to keep me waiting, I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation but I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder it stars thinking you'll come around
And maybe someday when we're older this is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every morning while you're watching the news


But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson,"" foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will have to learn the hard way instead of walking out


Now I'm sliding down the wall with my head in my hands
Saying, ""How could I not see the signs?""
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screaming in the silence
And the voices in my head are telling me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson


But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson,"" foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will have to learn the hard way instead of walking out


Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sitting 'round waiting for confessions of love, they ain't never gonna come
And thinking he's the one, you should've been walking out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love, when all is said and done
He just wasn't the one, no, he just wasn't the one"
We Should Get Married,18,Dan + Shay,"Yeah I know that we just met
So pardon my drunk confidence
And I know you don't know me yet
But my heart skipped 10 steps ahead
Yeah you can call me crazy
But I think maybe
We should start forever right now
We should get married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel
Hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white dress
I could rent a cheap suit
Feed each other wedding cake
Book a little honeymoon
7 days in Paris
Yeah I'm talking Tennessee
Ain't no point in waiting
Baby I'm just saying
We should get married
Yeah we should (Ooh)
Oh-yeah
Oh, baby, we should get married, uh-huh
We could stay here for one more drink
Or we could double down on some pawn shop rings
Give a heads up to your mom and dad
Or we could let 'em know when we get back
I hear them church bells ringing
The choir singing
See you walking down the aisle
We should get married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel
Hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white dress

Baby I'm just saying

We shouldn't even think about it
We should just do it, we should do it right now
Let me hear that guitar playin' for me one time
Uh-huh, that sounds good
We could take it nice and slow
We could book a flight, let's go
If you want me to I'll get down on one knee
One, two, three, four wait
We should get married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel
Hire us an Elvis

For The Good Times,71,Kris Kristofferson,"Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on
and this old world
will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had
some time to spend together
There's no need to watch
the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender
body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me
one more time
For the good times
I'll get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find
you ever need me
Don't say a word about
tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and
tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you
love me one more time
For the good times"

Allow me that

And I can't let go of your hand
Lord can you hear me now
Lord can you hear me now

Superman (Taylor’s Version),299,Taylor Swift,"Tall, dark, and Superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word that you say
And you smile and say, ""How are you?""
I'll say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you
I love you, I love you forever
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they said
And you leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I've loved you from the very first day
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Always On My Mind,314,Willie Nelson,"Maybe I didn't treat you Quite
as good as I should have
어쩌면 나 내가 할 수 있는 만큼
당신에게 잘 대해주지 않았는지도 몰라요
Maybe I didn't love you Quite
as often as I could have
어쩌면 나 최선을 다해서
당신을 사랑하지 않았는지도 몰라요
Little things I should have said and done
작은 부분까지 말해주고 해줬어야 했는데
I just never took the time
그러질 못했어요

You were always on my mind
내 맘속엔 언제나 당신이 있었는데
You are always on my mind
내 맘속엔 언제나 당신이 있었는데

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
어쩌면 당신이 정말 외롭고 외로웠을
때 당신을 안아주지도 않았을 거에요
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
당신이 내 사랑이어서
너무 행복하다고 말한 적도 없네요
If I make you feel second best
당신이 뒷전이라는 그런 느낌이 들었다면
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
그대, 정말 미안해요 내가 바보였어요

You were always on my mind
내 맘속엔 언제나 당신이 있었는데
You are always on my mind
내 맘속엔 언제나 당신이 있었는데

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
말해줘요.. 당신의 달콤한 사랑이
사라지지 않았다고 말해줘요
Give me, give me one more chance
내게 줘요.. 한번만 더 기회를 내게 주세요
To keep you satisfied, satisfied
당신을 만족시킬 수 있는 기회를 줘요

Little things I should have said and done
작은 부분까지 말하고 행동했어야 했는데
I just never took the time
그런 적이 없었어요

You were always on my mind
내 맘속엔 언제나 당신이 있었는데
You are always on my mind
내 맘속엔 언제나 당신이 있었는데"
Scarborough Fair,329,Simon & Garfunkel,"Are you going to
Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Remember me
to one who lives there
She once was
a true love of mine

Tell her to make me
a cambric shirt
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme

Without no seams
nor needless work
Then she'll be
a true love of mine

Tell her to find me
an acre of land
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme

Between the salt water
and the sea strand
Then she'll be
a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
And gather it all
in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be
a true love of mine

Are you going to
Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme

Remember me
to one who lives there
She once was
a true love of mine"
Forever & Always (Piano Ver.),"2,138",Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
When I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone
and he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me
to the core Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
But I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone
and he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so

Oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything
Back up baby back up did you
forget everything

'Cause it rains in your
bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone
and he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when we said
forever and always
cause And it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't mean it baby you said
forever and always"
Morning Sunshine,503,Julien May,"I wanna wake up
on the beach
no phone or pager
within reach
just us together in the
big blue sea
come back and lay down
with you next to me
the good life
you and I
and repeat endlessly
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life
lets play here all day
lets lay here all day
bask in our paradise
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life

I wanna wake up
next to you
shake off the sand we
rolled into
still little fuzzy from the
night before
skinny dipping and then
wanting more
the good life you and I
and repeat endlessly
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life
lets play here all day
lets lay here all day
bask in our paradise
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning sunshine
set up a hammock
in between
coconut trees
by a stream
sip on a rum punch
in the shade
and mellow out till
the day fades
then fall asleep and wake up
with you again
a rush of pleasure
that just never ends
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life
lets play here all day
lets lay here all day
bask in our paradise
morning sunshine
where have you been
all my life

Give Me Love,908,Ed Sheeran,"Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out

Break
Hidden track The Parting Glass
Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,584,Taylor Swift,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, yeah)
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

You Belong With Me,496,Taylor Swift,"You're on the phone with your
girlfriend shes upset
Shes going off about
something that you said
Cause she doesn't
get your humor like i do
I'm in my room
it's a typical tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of
music she doesn't like
And she'll never
know your story like i do
But she wears short skirts
i wear T shirts
She's cheer captain and
i'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
when you wake up
And find what you're
looking for has been here
the whole time
If you could
see that i'm the one who
understands you
Been here all along
so why can't you see
You You belong with me
you belong with me
Walkin' the streets
with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is
how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench
thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy
And you've got a smile that could
light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a
while since she brought you down
You say you're fine
i know you better then that
Hey whatcha doing with a
girl like that
She wears high heels
i wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain and
i'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
when you wake up and find
That what you're
looking for has been here the
whole time If you could
see that i'm the one who
understands you
Been here all along
so why can't you see
You You belong with me
Standing by and
waiting at your back door
All this time
how could you not know baby
You belong with me
you belong with me

Oh i remember you
drivin' to my house in the
middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
And i know your favorite songs
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me
Can't you see that i'm
the one who understands you
Been here all along
so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and
waiting at your back door
All this time
how could you not know
Baby you belong with me

You belong with me

just maybe you belong with me

Old Pine (Album Version),706,Ben Howard,"Hot sand on toes
cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know that memories
Were the best things you ever had
The summer shone
beat down on bony backs
So far from home
where the ocean stood
Down dust and pine cone tracks
We slept like dogs
down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog all around us
The boom of summer time
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth
rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning
Hot sand on toes
cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know
the friends around you
Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs
or the echoed stone
Careless and young
free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls now
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth
rang true inside these bones
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth
rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning
We grow grow steady as the morning
We grow grow older still
We grow grow happy as a new dawn
We grow grow older still
We grow grow steady as the flowers
We grow grow older still
We grow grow happy as a new dawn
We grow grow older still"
Sorry Or Please,665,Kings Of Convenience,"Five weeks in a prison
I made no friends
There's more time to be done
but I've got a week to spend
I didn't pay much attention
first time around but now
you're hard not to notice
right here in my town
Where the stage of my old life
meets the cast of the new
Tonights actors me and you
Each day is taking us closer
while drawing the curtains to close
This far or further I need to know
Your increasingly long embraces
are they saying sorry or please
I don't know what's happening
help me

Through the streets on the corners
there's a scent in the air
I ask you out and I lead you
I know my way around here
There's a bench I remember
and on the way there I find
that the movements you're making
are mirrored in mine
And your hand is held open
intentionally or
just what I want to see
Your increasingly long embraces
are they saying sorry or please
I don't know what's
happening help me
I don't normally beg for assistance
I rely on my own eyes to see
but right now they make
no sense to me
right now you make no sense to me"
Hurt,"2,430",Johnny Cash,"I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but I remember everything
what have I become
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
I am still right here
what have I become
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
if I could start again
a million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Wayfaring Stranger (Remastered LP Ver.),396,Emmylou Harris,"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling thru
this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness
toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home

I know dark clouds
will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields
lie just before me
Where God's redeemed
their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home"

what I planned tomorrow
I can't remember
when it's time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came before
I wanted to think
there was endless love
Until I saw the light
dim in your eyes
In the dead of
I found out
Sometimes there's
love that won't survive
New York City Such
a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful disease
Laura kept all her
disappointments
Locked up in a box
behind her closet door
She pulled the blinds
and listened to the thunder
With no way out
from the family store
We all told her things
could get better
When you just say goodbye
I'll lay awake one more night
Caught in a vision
I want to deny
And did I mention
the note that I found
Taped to my locked front door
It talked about no regrets
As it slipped from
my hand to the scuffed tile floor
I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the
people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie's lullaby
New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beauful disease
We were full of the stuff
that every dream rested
As if floating
on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattoed conclusion
That the big one
was knocking on the door
What started
as a mass delusion
Would take me far
from the place I adore
New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
you are my beautiful
Such a beauful disease"

I hope what goes comes
all the way around
I hope she makes
you feel the same way
About her that I feel
about you right now
I hope you both feel the sparks
by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one
by the end of the night
I hope you never
ever felt more free
Tell your friends
that you're so happy
I hope she comes along
and wrecks every one
of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime
to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder
than your wildest dreams
She's everything
you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
like you did on me
Like you did on me"

It's True,18,Alex Bayly,"Sitting Down or passing out
Waking up hungover as hell
I phone to say I'm still alive
Or just about it's hard to tell

It's true, it's true
I do want you oh
It's true, it's true
I do want you oh
When I'm away from you
I do want you, do want you
It's true, it's true
I do want you oh

Your voice it soothes a weary head
While my legs are pulled out bed
Friend puts me on my ass on the floor
Do you recall the night before

Shrug and say I think so
My hands to throb and ache and swell.
Man you let one rip on head
Broke your hand and now you're dead.

It's true, it's true
I do want you oh
It's true, it's true
I do want you oh
When I'm away from you
I do want you, do want you
It's true, it's true
I do want you oh

Josh he took it pretty well
He was with fault but you'd never tell
Never use my fists in a fight
Only regret I have of that night."

23,154,Sam Hunt,"You can marry an architect
Build you a house out on the water
That really impresses your father
And you can find
some grown up friends
And drink some wine in California
But even if you cut it shorter
You'll always have long blond hair
You'll always be Memphis queen
You'll always be
my first time in New Orleans
No matter where I go,
no matter what I do
I'll never be 23 with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll never be 23
with anyone but me
We'll always have Folly beach
We'll always have delta nights
We'll always be in-between
real love and real life
You can ride the train to work
Straighten out your accent in the city
Like your folks ain't from Mississippi
You probably got an office view
Wearing those skirts you always hated
Yeah, you're so sophisticated
But I bet you when you drink too much
I bet you're thinking 'bout back when
I really hope you're happy now
I'm really glad I knew you then
No matter where I go,
no matter what I do
I'll never be 23 with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll never be 23
with anyone but me
We'll always have Folly beach
We'll always have delta nights
We'll always be in-between
real love and real life
You'll always have your first last name
Standing in that July rain
Telling me your mind is changed
But in my mind you're still the same
Long blond hair
You'll always be Memphis queen
You'll always be
my first time in New Orleans
No matter where I go,
no matter what I do
I'll never be 23 with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll never be 23

Good Beer,54,Seaforth,"Nah I couldn't show you 'round
No city outside this town
Ain't much for the cocktail crowd
I've been there and I got kicked out, huh
I ain't got no stock in Tesla
Just these six strings to impress ya, yeah
There's a whole lot I don't but
I know what

[Chorus: Seaforth]
I know that a good beer is a cold one
If you got green, better roll one
And the right drive is a slow one
Down the back road baby I know
That the whole town's for the home team
Bit of hoedown in them old jeans
And I'm damn sure that the day's done
With a good beer and a good beer is a cold one

[Verse 2: Jordan Davis]
And a good beer taste better on a Friday night
Feels different under neon lights
Long as it's been sitting on ice
There ain't a time that it don't hit right
If you're drinking to forget her
Or drinking to remember, well
There's a whole lot I don't but
I know what

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
I know that a good beer is a cold one
If you got green, better roll one
And the right drive is a slow one
Down the back road baby I know
That the whole town's for the home team
Bit of hoedown in them old jeans
And I'm damn sure that the day's done
With a good beer and a good beer is a cold one
It's a good beer baby

[Bridge]
If that's Mountain's glowing that I'ma crack it open

[Chorus: Seaforth & Jordan Davis, Both]
'Cause a good beer is a cold one
If you got green, better roll one
And the right drive is a slow one
Down the back road baby I know
That the whole town's for the home team

Autumn,213,Carla Bruni,"There is a wind where the rose was
cold rain where sweet grass was
and clouds like sheep
stream o'er the steep
grey skies where the lark was
Nought gold where you hair was
nought warm where your hand was
but phantom forlorn
beneath the thorn
your ghost where your face was
Sad winds where your voice was
tears tears where my heart was
and ever with me
child ever with me
silence where hope was
There is a wind where the rose was
There is a wind where the rose was"
The Thrill Is Gone,710,B.B. King,"The thrill is gone,
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you've done me wrong, baby
And you'll be sorry someday
The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill has gone away from me
Although I'm still livin'
But it's a long way out here
The thrill is gone
Its gone away for good
Oh, The thrill is gone, baby
Its gone away for good
Some day I know I'll be open armed, baby
Just like I know a man should
You know I'm free free now baby,
I'm free from your spell
Well I'm free free free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over,
Alls I can do is wish you well"
"Puff, The Magic Dragon","1,380","Peter, Paul & Mary","Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff and brought
him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff

Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea

Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.

together they would travel on a boat with billowed sails.
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princess would bow when there they came.
Pirate ships would lower their flads when Puff
roared out his name.

Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giants rings make way for other toys.
One gray night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow.
Grief scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave.
So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave.

Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee."
Freedom And Its Owner,"1,341",Kings Of Convenience,"The beauty memories
of all the places
We`ve captured
with our camera
We`ve seen the pyramids
We`ve seen the Louvre
We`ve seen
the Orion upside down
Total eclipses
and moonlight shadows
We`ve seen dolphins
jumping waves
we`ve ski`ed the mountains
and we swam in the rivers
and let the sunlight
dry our skins
but freedom
freedom never greater
than its owner
freedom is the mastery
of the known
freedom freedom never
greater than its owner
no view is wider than the eye
show a view to someone
who chose to live
his whole life in cave
he`ll raise his arms
to protect his eyes from learning
and the blindness
to which he belongs
this time it`s me it`s me
cascades of chances
I`ll just let them be
the unfamiliar is
right below our eyes
don`t look for what we know
the unfamiliar
is right below our eyes
but freedom
freedom never greater
than its owner
freedom is the mastery
of the known
freedom freedom
never greater than its owner
no view is wider than the eye"
Lady,571,Kenny Rogers,"Lady I'm your knight in shining

ways I want to say I love you
Let me hold you
in my arms forever more
You have gone
and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh we belong together
Won't you believe in my song
Lady for so many years
I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life
and made me whole
Forever let me wake to see
you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper
softly in my ear
In my eyes I see
no one else but you
There's no other
love like our love
And yes oh yes
I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long
Lady your love's the only
love I need
And beside me is
where I want you to be
'Cause my love
there's something
I want you to know
You're the love of my life
you're my lady"
When We Were Young,753,Passenger,"We used to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding
Years leave quicker every time
they come
Remember when we were young
Look back to the best of days
Collecting all yesterdays
As they built up one by one
Oh how we beg and we borrow
Say we do it tomorrow
But tomorrow never seems to come
We used to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding
Years leave quicker every time
they come
Remember when we were young
And we were boys on the beach
Everything was in reach
I know it's hard to remember
And all had the years they vanish
I always wanted to learn Spanish
And travel round South-America
We used to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding
Years leave quicker every time
they come
Do you remember
when we were young
We used to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding yeah
Years leave quicker every time
they come
Do you remember
when we were young
Do you remember
when we were young
Do you remember
when we were young
Do you remember
when we were young"
Home,966,Joshua Hyslop,"In the dark in the quiet now
It's too much for me to take
To feel alone as if
there's no way out
Oh give me piece of mind today
When the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
In the dark every lights gone out
And there's nothing left to see
I hear her voice softly calling out
To go the depth and feel the wait
And the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
And the nights are long
And the days go on
And you feel like home"
Homesick,"1,105",Kane Brown,"Dancin' in the kitchen
you singing my favorite songs

every reason why
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No it don't quit

If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you

all I think about
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it

I thought that we were somethin'
she thought we were nothin'
She broke my heart oh yeah
She called it quits yeah
But lookin' back man

Morphine,50,Ron Pope,"I probably shouldn't say you make me feel this way
But I can't help myself when you're around
I took a lethal dose, so now I am a ghost
Floating through the hallways of your house
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing
Sometimes I live in fear that you will disappear
So I pretend I do not care at all
But you call every bluff, do not betray my trust
And catch me as I try my best to fall
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing
So here we are again, we masquerade as friends
Pretending for ourselves and no one else
'Cause everybody sees we're lying through our teeth
But you're the only medicine that helps
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing"

Save your money on the roses, baby
Just leave a daisy on the dashboard
Just pick me up in your old Bronco, baby
Don't gotta ride in on a white horse

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you're younger they say it's a kiss in the rain
Throwin' rocks at a window

[Chorus]
But it's when we're in a crowded room, put your hand on my back
And waitin' on me in the mornin' with my coffee black
Back to the basics 'cause they're bigger than they seem, yeah
Give me that typical, simple love, it's the little things, mm
Yeah, it's the little things (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
It's the little things

[Verse 2]
It's knowin' when you need to pull me closеr
And when you need to give me my spacе
It's wine and vinyl, my head on your shoulder
Don't gotta treat it like a first date

Used to think it would be a backseat sex scene
Drawin' hearts on the window, mm, but

It's when we're a crowded room, put your hand on my back
And waitin' on me in the mornin' with my coffee black
Back to the basics 'cause they're bigger than they seem, yeah

Give me that typical, simple love, it's the little things, mm, mm-mm
Yeah, it's the little things (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)

Ooh, it ain't grandiose (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Just pull me in and kiss me slow
Ooh, it ain't just for show (It ain't just for show)
Let's not go big, let's just go home

It's when we're in a crowded room, put your hand on my back
And waitin' on me in the mornin' with my coffee black
Back to the basics 'cause they're bigger than they seem, yeah
Give me that typical, simple love, it's the little things
When I go drinkin' with the girls and you leave on the light
The way you get me laughin' in the middle of a fight
Back to the basics 'cause they're bigger than they seem, yeah
(Bigger than they seem, yeah)
Give me that typical, simple love, it's the little things
Yeah, it's the little (It's the little), the little things
Yeah, it's the little, yeah, it's the little things"

Our Time,15,Roo Panes,"Woke up this morning so excited,
Laughed into my coffee couldn’t hide it.
Cos all of these years that I’ve lived alone,
Finally you and I will build a home.

33 years on this planet,
Don’t think i’ll ever understand it,
If it’s working out better than I planned it,
Or maybe i’m coming in for landing.

What shall we do with our time?
Cos we’ll do the rest together,
Oh what shall we do with our lifetime?
Something we can do forever.

Dust in the air from making changes,
Let every clear morning turn the pages.
When I open my eyes and you’re the one I find,
I will be yours and you’ll be mine.

Cos it’s our time, our time,
Oh it’s our time, our time now.

What shall we do with our time?
Cos we’ll do the rest together,
Oh what shall we do with our lifetime?
Something we can do forever."

Hero,51,Sarcastic Sounds,"So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend

And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else"

Stay Stay Stay,547,Taylor Swift,"I'm pretty sure
we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room
at you
I was expecting
some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning
I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never
leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in
wearing a football helmet
And said Okay let's talk
And I said
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you
for quite some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay
Before you
I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems
out on me
But you carry my groceries and now
I'm always laughing
And I love you
because you have given me
No choice but to
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you
for quite some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay stay stay stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
for my whole life
Stay and I'll be loving you
for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me
when I get mad mad mad
So I think that it's best
if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you
for quite some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you
for quite some time time time
You think that it's funny
when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we both stay
ha-ha-ha it's so fun"
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,705,Taylor Swift,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Outro]
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, yeah)
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
Tell Me Why (Taylor’s Version),581,Taylor Swift,"I took a chance
I took a shot
And you might think
I'm bulletproof but I'm not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground
I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me
then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you
got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover
when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes I remember
what you said last night
And I know that you see
what you're doin' to me
Tell me why
Well you could write a book on
How to ruin
someone's perfеct day
Well I get so confused
and frustratеd
Forget what I'm tryin' to say oh
I'm sick and tired
of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me
then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover
when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes I remember
what you said last night
And I know that you see
what you're doin' to me
Tell me why
Why do you have
to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to
put down my dreams
So you're the only thing
on my mind
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me
then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love
then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes I remember
what you said last night
And I know that you see
what you're doin' to me
Tell me why Why
Tell me why Oh
I take a step back I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know"
You Belong With Me,"1,797",Taylor Swift,"You're on the phone with your
girlfriend She's upset
She's going off about
something that you said
She doesnt
get your humour like I do
I'm in the room
its a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of
music she doesnt like
And she'll never
know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear t shirts
She's cheer captain and
I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day
when you'll wake up and find
That what you're lookin for
has been here the whole time
If you could see that
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walkin the streets with you
in your worn out jeans
I cant help thinking this is
how it ought to be
Laughing on the park
bench thinkin to myself
Hey isnt this easy
And you've got a smile
that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in
awhile since she brought you down
You say you find
I know you better than that
Hey Whatcha doing with a
girl like that
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and
I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day
when you'll wake up and find
That what you're
looking for has been
here the whole time
If you could see that
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standin by
waiting at your back door
All this time how
could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh I remember you
driving to my house
in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite songs
and you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by or waiting at
your back door
All this time how
could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me"
I Don't Have Time To Be In Love,"3,059",Priscilla Ahn,"I don't have time to be in love
kissing you on the cheek
200 times a week
I don't have time to be in love
watching a foreign film
feet on the windowsill
but that's not true when I'm with you
I don't have time to be in love
way too much candlelight
keeping me warm at night
I don't have time to be in love
cooking a meal for two
climbing all over you
but that's not true when I'm with you
cause I used to be there for you
when you were so blue
I'd walk with you in the rain
nothing was better
when we did it together
I don't have time for love
I don't have time to be in love
holding you to my chest
feeling your every breath
I don't have time to be in love
laughing so hard we cry
sometimes I don't know why
I don't have time to be in love
maybe this revely
just wasn't meant for me
but that's not true when I'm with you
when I'm with you"

Lego House (Acoustic),"1,717",Ed Sheeran,"I'm gonna pick up the pieces
and build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind it's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
If things go right we can frame
it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
And it's a dark and cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broke I'll mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down

One Last Cry,"2,538",Sabrina,"My shattered dreams and broken
Heart are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands standing
Close to someone else
Now I sit all alone
wishing all my feeling was gone
I get my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you
out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess
I'm down to one last cry
I was here you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love
to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feelings
were gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you
out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I know I gotta be strong
But 'round me
Life goes on and on and on
and on
I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I have
my one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you
out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down
I guess
I'm down to one last cry"
Cruise,580,Florida Georgia Line,"Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Hey baby
Yeah when I first saw that bikini
top on her
She's poppin' right out of the
South Georgia water
Thought Oh good lord
she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself
so I walked up and said
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy
with a lift kit
Would look a hell of
a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
She was sippin' on Southern
and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the
sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab
of my truck and said
Fire it up
let's go get this thing stuck
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy
with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better
with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to
its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights
and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right her and I
man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat
in my chest bumpin’
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy
with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better
with you up in it Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise

Girls on the TV,149,Laura Jean,"Ricky played the flute
But she never had a use for it
Miming her part in the school band
While I took a solo
on the saxophone
And I learned harmony
But she could dance
she could move
Like the girls on the TV
Mum took her
to Johnny Young Talent School
But she quit
She said that she got scared
When they made her do the splits
She tried tap school
and blew the teacher away
But the girls
in the class teased her
Saying she was too chubby
I remember when she told me
She cried in shame
I told her not to worry
We can do anything
I told her one day
we’d be beautiful
And maybe we could start a band
‘cos I was born to sing
And she was born to dance
She was born to dance like the
Girls on the TV girls on the TV
She could always dance
better than the
Girls on the TV 10am RnB
She could always dance
better than me
She was bullied all day
And made to feel like a fool
Mum was born again and decided
To send her
to the Christian school
On Thursdays her friends
Would dance in the spirit
At the school church
but Ricky laughed
And never believed in it
We moved in with Mum’s first
Boyfriend after Dad
He was only 21
and he’d always get mad
While I hid in my room
Writing poems after school
He tried to kiss Ricky
On the piano stool
I remember when she told me
She was on cocaine
I felt like I didn’t know her
Or how she got that way
Now her lovers are all married
I wear my wedding ring
On my right hand
Maybe we weren’t meant
to settle down
No I was born to sing
And she was born to dance like the
Girls on the TV
Girls on the TV
She could always dance
better than the
Girls on the TV 10am RnB
She could always dance
better than the
Girls on the TV
She could always dance
better than the

She could always dance
better than the

She could always dance
better than the

You're Somebody Else,849,Flora Cash,"I saw the part of you
That only when you're older
you will see too
You will see too
I held the better cards
But every stroke of luck
has gotta bleed through
It's gotta bleed through
You held the balance of the time
That only blindly I could read you
But I could read you
It's like you told me
Go forward slowly
It's not a race to the end
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well you talk like yourself
No I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous
You were the better part
Of every bit of beating
heart that I had
Whatever I had
I finally sat alone
Pitch black flesh and bone
Couldn't believe
that you were gone
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well you talk like yourself
No I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface Surface
Well you talk like yourself

Tricks,663,Stella Donnelly,"You had dinner at Jude's

Telling your favourite joke
where you break all the plates

off the back of the boat
You said that you’re gonna
quit but we know that you won't
You won't you won’t
You only like me
when I do my tricks for you
You wear me out like you
wear that southern cross tattoo
You said I'd look much better
if I dropped the attitude
Leave it alone leave it alone
leave it alone leave it alone

lined up in a row
Driving back from the job
with Kyle and Jackie-O
You want all of us
to pull you out of the muck
You're always wanting a kiss
and then you want to get laid
Get laid get laid
You only like me
when I do my tricks for you
And you wear me out

Mandolin Rain,162,Music Travel Love,"The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain
under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you
got till you lose it all again
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
A cool evening dance
Listening to the bluegrass
band takes the chill
From the air till
they play the last song
I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind
but there's moments
That I find I'm not feeling so strong
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Oh Listen to mandolin rain
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Oh Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the mandolin rain
Oh Listen to the mandolin rain"
Song For Our Daughter,92,Laura Marling,"Though they may want you to tread in their trail
Only to see if the path they set fails
Though they may want you to take off your clothes
Whatever they think that the action exposed
With your clothes on the floor
Taking advice from some old balding bore
You'll ask yourself, ""Did I want this at all?""

Do you remember what I said?
The book I left by your bed
The words that some survivor read

Lately I've been thinking about our daughter growing old
All of the bullshit that she might be told
There's blood on the floor
Maybe now you'll believe her for sure
She remembers what I said
The book I left by her bed
The words that some survivor read

Though they may take you for all you had left
You won't be forgotten for what you had not done yet
So you wished for a kiss from God
And you mourned in your childish loss
Innocence gone but it's not forgot
You'll get your way through it somehow

You remember what I said
The book you left by your bed
The words that will outlive the dead"
7 Summers,545,Morgan Wallen,"Yeah you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer
lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond
on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house
But I wonder
when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger
who knows
Back then
you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin'

Bought a few acres
couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things
my way anyway
But I wonder
when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger
who knows
Back then
you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago
Ooh
Seven summers ago
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Seven summers ago
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah I wonder
when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger
who knows
Back then
you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago
Ooh
Seven summers ago
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Seven summers ago
Ooh ooh-ooh"
Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),"1,059",Taylor Swift,"Mr. Perfect face
Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye
and told me
you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've been waitin' for you
all my life
Mr. Every single day
until the end
I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know
Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone
I fall apart
It takes everything in me
just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see
that you're okay
Hello Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart
after breaking mine
Mr. Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Hello Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves
around you
I've been Miss Misery
since your goodbye
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine
Mr. Never told me why
Mr. Never had to see me cry
Mr. Insincere apology
so he doesn't look
like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well I thought you might be
different than the rest
I guess you're all the same
'Cause I hear he's got his arm
'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart
he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past
what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see
that it never fazed you
Hello Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart
after breakin' mine
Mr. Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Hello Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves
around you
I've been Miss Misery
since your goodbye
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine
So dignified in your
well-pressed suit
So strategized
all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat
in the best room
Oh he's so smug
Mr. Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss
Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then
you'll be Mr. Too late
Goodbye Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart
after breakin' mine
Mr. Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Goodbye Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves
around you
I've been Miss Misery
for the last time
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine
You're perfectly fine
Mr. Look me
in the eye and told me
you would never go away
You said you'd never go away"

Mood Ring,838,Lorde,"I'm tryna blow bubbles but inside
Can't seem to fix my mood
Today it's as dark as my roots
If I if I ever let them grow out Ah-ah
Now all of my oceans have riptides
Can't seem to find what's wrong
The whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s
seem so far away
Ay-ay-ay-ay
Ladies begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations
Love and light
You can burn sage
and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high
but only if the wind blows
Blows just right
I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away floating away
I'm tryna get well from the inside
Plants and celebrity news
all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewherе eastern
they'll havе what I need
They'll have what I need
Let's go
Ladies begin your sun salutations
Pluto in Scorpio generation
Love and light
You can burn sage
and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high
but only if the wind blows
Blows just right ri-ri-ri-right
I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep dancing
'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away floating away
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place
Anywhere
Watch the sun set
look back on my life
Take me to some kinda
I just wanna know
will it be alright
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place
Anywhere"

The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version),547,Taylor Swift,"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that Baby I'm right here smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars
had just aligned
And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But thеre was one thing missing
And that was the momеnt I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends
always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said he'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
Missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming
down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means
the most to you
Is the one who didn't show
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me
singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You called me later
And said I'm sorry I didn't make it
And I said I'm sorry too
And that was the moment I knew"
You (Acoustic),91,Dan + Shay,"Baby, standing here with you
With your arms around my shoulders
We're dancing with the moon

And baby, it feels just like a dream
When I whisper that I love you
And you say it back to me

I got you
For the rest of my days
In the sun on Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain

I got you
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright

Cuz I got you
You and only you
You and only you

Baby, lookin' in your eyes
It's like we're in slow motion
Just you and me tonight

Then baby, you lean for a kiss
And I know and I know and I know that it don't get better than this

I've got forever
And I've got all I'll ever need"

Books of Fantasy,22,Mark Diamond,"She likes staying up 'til 3
Reading books of fantasy
Getting lost in other worlds
Only she can see
She likes singing paramore
Playing drums on my dashboard
Every note she hits with ease
I'll listen forevermore

It's been a long long day near sunset
and my minds racing baby i'm just wondering

Do I remind you of any characters
You've been dreaming of while the pages turn
Do I even stand a chance
Do I even make the cut
Am I the good guy
Do I make to the last chapter

She loves breaking up the ice
Same old joke told once or twice
Only lands a couple laughs
But it gets her every time
She loves london in the fall
Hyde Park with alcohol
Just leaving for a week
Makes it worth it all

It's been a long long day near sunset
and my minds racing baby I'm just wondering

Do I remind you of any characters
You've been dreaming of while the pages turn
Do I even stand a chance
Do I even make the cut
Am I the good guy
Do I make to the last chapter

It's been a long long day near sunset
and my minds racing baby I'm just wondering

Do I remind you of any characters
You've been dreaming of while the pages turn
Do I even stand a chance
Do I even make the cut

He'll Have To Go,240,Jim Reeves,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you,
he'll have to go
Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Though love is blind, make up your mind,
I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him,
he'll have to go?
You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you want me? Answer yes or no
Darling, I will understand
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you
He'll have to go"

Hallelujah,781,Leonard Cohen,"Now I've heard
there was a secret chord
That David played
and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really
care for music do you
It goes like this
The fourth the fifth
The minor fall the major lift
The baffled king
composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Your faith was strong
but you needed proof
You saw her bathing
on the roof
Her beauty and the
moonlight overthrew her
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
and she cut your hair
And from your lips
she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did well really
what's it to you
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth
I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue
but Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah"
Both Sides Now,406,Joni Mitchell,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and THEY snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way THAT you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh but now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"
Scarborough Fair/Canticle,115,Simon & Garfunkel,"Are you going to
Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Remember me
to one who lives there
She once was
a true love of mine

Tell her to make me
a cambric shirt
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Without no seams
nor needless work
Then she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell her to find me
an acre of land
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Between the salt water
and the sea strand
Then she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
And gather it all
in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be
a true love of mine
Are you going to
Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Remember me
to one who lives there
She once was
a true love of mine"
The Ace Of Sorrow,239,Brown & Dana,"To the queen of hearts he's the ace of sorrow

He's here today, he's gone tomorrow

Young men are plenty but sweethearts few

If my love leave me what shall I do?



Had I the store in yonder mountain

Where gold and silver is there for counting

I could not count for thought of thee

My eyes so full I could not see



My father left me both house and land

And servants many at my command

At my commandment they ne'er shall be

I'll forsake them all and go with thee



I love my father, I love my mother

I love my sister, I love my brother

I love my friends and relations too

I'll leave them all and go with you



To the queen of hearts he's the ace of sorrow

He's here today, he's gone tomorrow

Young men are plenty but sweethearts few

if my love leaves me what shall I do?"
My Ship Isn't Pretty,784,Kings Of Convenience,"The telegraph gave us hope
Before was the silence
and the panic it brought
The sky was the blankest sheet
We drew lines upon it
so our thoughts could meet
through cables black and cold
we carry our intentions to bridge
and bring home
would it all be so clear
if the lines were erased
and the silence restored
Boys of today write lines on walls
in the streets at night
in suburbans of cities with no name
is this destruction
or just quiet protest
against loneliness
the car go lights in our lamps
they`re weight is so heavy
and this is all we know
our message will need a ship
to travel across oceans
that can`t otherwise be crossed
it underplate on the waves
and cautions the water
so we can be safe
it underplate on the waves
then cautions the water
so we can be safe"
The Story Of Us,"1,839",Taylor Swift,"I used to think one day
we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks
flew instantly
And people would say
they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place
was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room
for an empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know
what page you're on
Oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things
that I wish you knew
So many walls up
I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy now
Next chapter

How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling
at my clothes and trying
to look busy
And you're doing your
best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day
I'll tell the story of us
how I was losing my mind
when I saw you here
But you held your pride like
you should've held me
Oh I'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending
this is nothing
I'd tell you I miss you
but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite
this loud
Now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they careless
But I liked it better
when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather
love than fight
So many things that you
wish I knew but the story of us
might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy NOW NOW NOW YEAH
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's killing me yeah
And I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy now

is just a waste of time
You're the first thing on my mind

You're the last thing that I think of

I wanna turn your volume up
And listen to you all day long
Now every other station's
just a memory
I change you
when your name broke off the dial
Is it funny how you
just keep running into me
I've been listening to
your music for a while
And you can have me
anytime you want
You can have me really
anytime you want
You can have me
anytime you want
You can have me

Fuerteventura,266,Russian Red,"You're always such a fool
And in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
Do you remember when
We used to live things separate
We hadn't met or thought
That could be possible
I'm glad you had your life
So good to listen to your past
All of those things brought you
With me and now we're two
You're always such a fool
And in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
And in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before
But if I try to think
Of something better than this
Heaven comes down
And reminds the luck we live
You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before"

It was 102
Nothin' to do

So we jumped in
We were summertime

Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here

Just what you were

Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk

is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed
to save you from random guys
That talk too much
and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but
I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away

Come on let's see where it goes
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind

I just wanna be alone with you
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind

I can see your dreams

Forever and ever

The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh it feels like the first time
every time

in your eyes
I don't know how you do
what you do

"Beginning Middle End (From The Netflix Film ""To All The Boys: Always and Forever"")","1,756",Leah Nobel,"Sometimes
you get what you've
always been wishing for
And most times
it's not on your deadline
But that's alright
I was worn out and jaded
from trying on people to love
But you fit so well
When they ask why
I can never explain
But a symphony played
when you told me your name
And I took that as a sign
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be mine
Mmm Hmm
Sometimes it's hard to see
what the future holds
And most times
it feels like a steep climb
And that's alright
There's magic in details
the tender small gestures of love
And the way they all add up
When they ask why
I can never explain
But a symphony played
when you told me your name
And it sounded like a sign
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be mine
Five years later
and I'm still yours
Ten years later
and I'm still yours
Fifty years later
and I'm still your
beginning and middle and end
Five years later
and I'm still yours
Ten years later
and I'm still yours
Fifty years later
and I'm still your
beginning and middle and end
beginning and middle and end
Oh
Will you be my beginning
my middle my end
Will you be my beginning
my middle my end
Will you be my beginning
my middle my end
Will you be mine"
Morning Has Broken (Remastered 2021),101,Cat Stevens,"Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the world
Sweet the rains new fall, sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dewfall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass
Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the one light, Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day
Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the world"
Harvest Moon,42,Sophia Alexa,"Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleepin'
We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon risin'
Let's go dancin' in the light
We know where the music's playin'
Let's go out and feel the night
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's gettin' late
And the moon is climbin' high
I want to celebrate
See it shinin' in your eye
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon"
Iris,128,Jada Facer,"And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am"

Parched,58,Olive Klug,"I collect your red flags and tie them to my chest
They're my new favorite dress
And I'm not one to brag
But I think I might pass your impossible test
I've been studying hard
Decoding equations of contradictory texts
And I think that I like
That I'm never quite sure
Who I'll be to you next

[Chorus]
You're a sunbeam
Through a brick wall
You're an empty glass on my bedside table
And I can't sleep
I'm too thirsty
But I'll refill you just as soon as I'm able

[Verse 2]
Our words dance in circles of meaningless hope
Til the music stops and I choke
You ask what do I mean
I just wanna get clean
And rewrite all the words that we spoke
These feelings are knives carving into our lives
But we blame it on the moon
But don't worry it's early enough in the game
We'll be over soon

[Chorus]
You're a sunbeam
Through a brick wall
You're an empty glass by my bedside table
And I can't sleep
I'm too thirsty
But I'll refill you
But only if you ask me to

[Verse 3]
I've been stuck in a drought
Thought you'd be my way out
But I'm parched after talking to you
I'm parched after talking to you"
Samalaman Bay,5,Roo Panes,"We drove all the way to Samalaman Bay
Never heard of the place 'til we got there
And the sand was so white
And the trees were so green
And the sea so blue
It made me think of you

[Chorus]
’Cause if I didn't have you to come home to
I'd probably find it hard to leave
But I do, oh I do, oh I do
I have you

[Verse 2]
We drove all the way to Samalaman bay
Where at the end of the day the sun’s still shining
We sat on the beach with the world out of reach
'Til wе saw the moon, it made me think of you

[Chorus]
'Causе if I didn't have you to come back to
I'd probably find it hard to leave
But I do, oh I do, oh I do
I have you
Oh, if I didn't have you to come back to, if I didn't have you
But I do, oh I do, oh I do
I have you

[Bridge]
'Cause love is brighter than that starry sky
Yet still I see you there and don’t know why
Maybe it illuminates my eyes to you
It illuminates my eyes to the beauty of you
The beauty of you

[Chorus]
If I didn’t have you to come back to
If I didn't have you
But I do, oh I do, oh I do
Oh I do, oh I do, oh I do
Oh I do, oh I do, oh I do
Oh I do, oh I do, oh I do
I have you"

I Knew You Were Trouble.,502,Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there)
So, shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble"

Jump Then Fall (Taylor’s Version),585,Taylor Swift,"I like the way
you sound in the morning
We're on the phone
and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk you didn't notice
I hear the words
but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine
I'll shine for you
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Well I like the way
your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face oh
I've never been so wrapped up
honey
I like the way you're everything
I ever wanted
I had time to think it o over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and
jump then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine
I'll shine for you
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
The bottom's gonna drop out
from under our feet
I'll catch you I'll catch you
When people say things
that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come
when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you
through the night until you smile
Whoa oh I need you baby
Don't be afraid please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Jump then fall into me into me
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you I'll show you
You can jump then fall

Jump then fall into me

First Day of My Life,144,Bright Eyes,"Verse 1
This is the first day of my life
I swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain suddenly, everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don’t know where I am
I don’t know where I’ve been
But I know where I want to go

Chorus
And so, I thought I’d let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Mhm mhm

Verse 2
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said “This is the first day of my life
I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now, I don’t care I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”

Chorus
So if you wanna be with me
With these things, there’s no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I’d rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Aha mmm
Besides, maybe this time is different
I mean, I really think you like me
Me-eee
Me-eeeee"

Right Here Waiting (Acoustic),21,Jada Facer,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you"
Empire Now,9,Hozier,"Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from, one hundred years from
Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from, one hundred years from


After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
The way that things are turnin'
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'


Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from thе empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
Onе hundred years from, one hundred years from


The martyrs of our revolution
Their spinnin' caused the earth to shake
The problem brought its own solution
They power now the world we've made



After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
For all the gold or sterling
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'


Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from, one hundred years from"
From This Moment On,368,Shania Twain,"I do swear
that I'll always be there.
I'd give anything and everything
and I will always care.
Through weakness and strength,
happiness and sorrow,
for better or worse,
I will love you
with every beat of my heart.

From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on

From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love
I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you,
can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer
to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment
I will love you as long as I live
From this moment on"
The Boxer,327,Simon & Garfunkel,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story
is seldom told
I have squandered
my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
all lies and jest Still
a man hears
what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest Mm mm

When I left my home
and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of
a railway station
Running scared
laying low Seeking out
the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
only they would know
Lie la lie

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come on from the
whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were
times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort
there Ooo la la

Lie la lie

Then I'm laying out
my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
going home
Where the New York City
winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that
laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving
But the fighter
still remains

Lie la lie"
Help Me Make It Through The Night,62,Kris Kristofferson,"Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose let it fall
Layin' soft up on my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
And i won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
Lord it's bad to be alone
Help me make it through the night"
Let It Grow,265,Eric Clapton,"Standing at the crossroads
trying to read the signs
To tell me which way
I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely let it grow

Looking for a reason
to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend
that I can count on
But there's nothing
left to show
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
let it grow

Time is getting shorter
and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get
what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow"
Rocky Mountain High,78,John Denver,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin¡？ home to a place he¡？d never been before
He left yesterday behind him,
you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains
his life was far away
On the road and hangin¡？ by a song
But the string¡？s already broken
and he doesn¡？t really care
It keeps changin¡？ fast and it don¡？t last for long

But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains,
he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once,
and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests
and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains
down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
I know he¡？d be a poorer man
if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high

It¡？s a Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody¡？s high
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high do de do"
If This City Never Sleeps,129,Rosie Thomas,"Oh at night when I sleep
Oh the dreams come to me
Make me believe that
my life is not my own
And if life were like my dreams
All the things I would see
I'd be so much braver than I know
mmmmm
No I can't understand
What it means to be a man
And to lead a woman from her home
And if love were indeed
All the things I believe
Then I guess
I would never feel alone
mmmmm
oh will I ever know
And if this city never sleeps
Does that mean that noone dreams
And if that's so
Then I guess I'm going home"

I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair

I was laughing at your stack of books

in your own little world
And me in it
You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothin'

Rocking that rock 'n roll t shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen
nothin' like you
When you're wearing them
worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing

I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me

Scarborough Fair / Canticle,381,Simon & Garfunkel,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
On the side of a hill,
in the deep forest green
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Tracing of sparrow on
snow-crested ground
Without no seams nor needle work
Blankets and bedclothes
the child of the mountain
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
Tell her to find me an acre of land
On the side of a hill,
a sprinkling of leaves
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Washes the grave with silvery tears
Between the salt water
and the sea strands
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Tell her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
War bellows blazing in
scarlet battalions
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Generals order their soldiers to kill
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And to fight for a cause
they've long ago forgotten
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine"

I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

[Bridge]
Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes, sometimes

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend"
Head High,688,Alexander Jean,"Theres more to life than happiness
More will never know
When you're heart is filled
with emptiness
Making a mess of your soul
When you're down and feeling low
wanting to give up give up give up
Just hold your head head high
Oh oh weve been lost here
once or twice
In this pitch black room
without a light
Even if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head head high
Just hold your head head high
There's more to love than
wanting love
More than we could show
Maybe its as simple as knowing
when to let go
When you're down and feeling low
don't give up give up give up
Just hold your head head high
Oh oh we've been lost here
once or twice
In this pitch black room
without a light
Even if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head head high
Just hold your head head high
Just hold your head head high
Hold your head head high
hold your head
Hold your head head high
ooh lord
Hold your head head high
Ooooh we've been lost here
once or twice
In this pitch black room
without a light
Even if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head head high
Just hold your head head high
Can't get no where
which' yo head down
can't get no where
Can't get no where
which' yo head down
with your head down
Can't get no where
which' yo head down
Can't get no where
which' yo head down
Can't get no where
which' yo head down
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up"

I Know The End,228,Phoebe Bridgers,"Somewhere in Germany,
but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back I'll lay around
And I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's no place like my room
But you had to go
I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and
melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go
I know, I know, I know
Out in the park, we watch the sunset
Talking on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet
And I got mean
Always pushing you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call, you come home
A bird in your teeth
So I gotta go
I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down
with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it
I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now
I know, I know, I know
Driving out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America First rap country song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolts of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said ""The End Is Near""
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is... ahh!"

Reach Out,125,Sufjan Stevens,"I have a memory
Of a time and place
where history resigned
Now my apology
All the light came in
to fulminate my mind
Reach out reach out
To all the ones
who came before you
Ponder what is right
You and I in defiance
Speak out speak out
The conversation may afford you
Wisdom of the wise
You and I in defiance
And I come from conscience
where there is no conjugation
I would rather be a flower
than the ocean
And I held myself as something
of an innovation
I would rather be devoured
than be broken
All my life I tried so hard
To separate myself from all
That is and was and will be torn apart
You were running unafraid
I know you but I've changed my way
You know I take it all to heart
Home is where you've called my name
I've gone as far as the eye can blame
You said love may have lost its way
Now my life has been erased
And what I gave I gave for you
And for myself and for the holy name
You were running unashamed
And yours is mine and all remains
As nothing ever stays the same
Reach out reach out to
all the ones who came before
Reach out reach out to
all the ones who came before
Reach out reach out and
all at once the pain restores you
Reach out reach out and
all at once the pain restores you
All at once the pain restores you
I have a memory of a time and
place where history resigned
Now in my reverie
For the guiding light
that opened up my mind"
Girl At Home (Taylor's Version),593,Taylor Swift,"Don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that Ah-Ah
Don’t look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do
what's upstanding and right
It’s kinda like a code yeah
And you've been
getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no one's exception
This I have previously learned
So don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that Ah-Ah
Don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got mе alone
And I say Don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And еverybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man
who makes me sad
While she waits up
you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her
So don’t look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that Ah-Ah
Don’t look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got me alone
And I say Don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh
Call a cab
Lose my number
You’re about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned
Don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that Ah-Ah
Don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you’re coming home
Don't look at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I haven't once been just like her"
Rock and A Hard Place,134,Bailey Zimmerman,"We’ve been swinging and missin’
It ain’t broke yet
But damn it needs fixin’
Been awhile since your kiss
felt like kissing
It’s just different
We’ve been talking bout forever
Since we’ve been together
Something bout a ring
Makes you think we’re better off with
All this
But we’re caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place
For the record, shit
Throwing in the towel
takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out
for better weather
Together
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place
We’ve been talking bout forever
Since we’ve been together
Something bout a ring
That makes you think
we’re better off with
All this
But we’re caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Tears rolling down your face
As I walked out the door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
How much more of this can we take"
Turnham Green,83,Adam Melchor,"Verse 1
You picked your chair to sit in
You made the bed in which you lay
I used to tuck you in it
You let your dreams take you away
The clock was always tickin'
I fought it off and stayed awake
But now these nights look different
The colors dyed another way

Pre-Chorus
So you asked me
What would I do
If just for a minute I was you

Chorus
I took every step
In your heart and in your head
I see what you see
But nothing looks right
You brought me somewhere I'd never be

Verse 2
You carved out your decision
Before you took the turn from me
The life we almost livеd in
The mornings walking Turnham Green

Pre-Chorus
So you asked me
What would I do
If just for a minutе I was you

Chorus
I took every step
In your heart and in your head
I see what you see
But nothing looks right
You brought me somewhere I'd never be

Chorus
I took every step
In your heart and in your head
I see what you see
But nothing looks right
You brought me somewhere I'd never be"

Strange Weather,13,Luke Sital-Singh,"The moon is letting go
Of everything I know tonight
The hours turn to days
The sky is out of phase
Are we alright?

[Pre-Chorus]
Overcrowded ghost town
Sun behind a dark cloud
All my favourite spots have closed down
Nowhere to go now

[Chorus]
Strange weather
Strange weather

[Verse 2]
It seems like yesterday
I could simply drift away from all this
Now I'm not so sure
About anything anymore
If I'm honest

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I out of my mind?
Is it a matter of time?

[Chorus]
Strange weather
Strange weather
Oh, strange weather
Is it gonna go on and on forever?

Overcrowded ghost town
The sun peaks through the dark cloud
All my favourite spots have closed down
We've nowhere to go now

Oh, strange weather
Is it gonna go on and on forever?

Religiously,82,Bailey Zimmerman,"I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

[Chorus]
And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

[Verse 2]
Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' hard just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

[Bridge]
You brought me to God and I put you through hell
You were all about us, I was all about myself
What kind of man would lose a woman like that?
If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back

[Chorus]
Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Beggin' God just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously

I ain't got the only woman who was there for me

We Should Get Married,92,Dan + Shay,"Yeah I know that we just met
So pardon my drunk confidence
And I know you don’t know me yet
But my heart skipped 10 steps ahead

Yeah you can call me crazy
But I think maybe
We should start forever right now

We should get married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel
Hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white dress
I could rent a cheap suit
Feed each other wedding cake
Book a little honeymoon
7 days in Paris
Yeah I’m talking Tennessee
Ain’t no point in waiting
Baby I’m just saying
We should get married

We could stay here for one more drink
Or we could double down on some pawn shop rings
Give a heads up to your mom and dad
Or we could let ‘em know when we get back

I hear them church bells ringing
The choir singing
See you walking down the aisle
We should get married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel
Hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white dress
I could rent a cheap suit
Feed each other wedding cake
Book a little honeymoon
7 days in Paris
Yeah I’m talking Tennessee
Ain’t no point in waiting
Baby I’m just saying
We should get married
We could take it nice and slow
We could book a flight, let’s go
If you want me to I’ll get down on one knee

We should get married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little chapel
Hire us an Elvis
Pink limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white dress
I could rent a cheap suit
Feed each other wedding cake
Book a little honeymoon
7 days in Paris
Yeah I’m talking Tennessee
Ain’t no point in waiting

When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me
You got troubles
And I got them too
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you
We stick together, we can see it through
Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them
Will ever love you
The way I do
It's me and you, boy
And as the years go by,
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me"

Baby It's Cold Outside (Feat. Norah Jones),531,Willie Nelson,"I really can't stay
Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands
they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half
a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
Neighbors might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat
your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say
that I tried
What's the sense
in hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside
I simply must go
Baby it's cold outside
Oh the answer is no
Baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh your lips look delicious
My brother will be there
at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind
is so vicious
Your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home
Maybe you'll freeze out there
Say lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be
plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt
Baby it's cold outside"
Fifteen,"1,565",Taylor Swift,"You take a deep breath
and you walk through the doors
Its the morning of your
very first day
you say hi to your friends you
aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
its your freshman year
and youre gonna be here
for the next four years
in this town
hoping one of those senior boys
will wink at you and say
you know I havent seen you around
before
Cause when youre fifteen
and somebody tells you
they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre fifteen
feeling like there
nothing to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before who youre
know who you gonna be fifteen

You sit in class next to a
redhead named Abigail
and soon enough youre best friends
laughing at the other girls
who think theyre so cool
well be out of here
as soon as we can
and then youre on your very
first date and hes got a car
and youre feeling like flying
and youre momas waiting up
and you think hes the one
and youre dancing round your room
when the night end
when the night ends
Cause when youre fifteen
and somebody tell you
they love you
youre gonna believe them
when youre fifteen
and your first kiss
makes your head spin round but
in your life youll do thing greater
than dating the
boy on the football team
but I didnt know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
was to be wanted
wish you could go back
and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore
I was gonna marry him someday
but I realized some bigger
dreams of mine
and Abigail gave everything
she had to a boy
who changed his mind and
we both cried
Cause when youre fifteen
and somebody tells you
they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre fifteen
dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found that time
can heal most anything
and you just might find who youre
supposed to be
I didnt know who
I was supposed to be at fifteen

Youre very first day

through those doors"
The Story Of Us,"1,352",Taylor Swift,"I used to think one day
we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks
flew instantly
And people would say
they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place
was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room
for an empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know
what page you're on
Oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things
that I wish you knew
So many walls up
I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy now
Next chapter

How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling
at my clothes and trying
to look busy
And you're doing your
best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day
I'll tell the story of us
how I was losing my mind
when I saw you here
But you held your pride like
you should've held me
Oh I'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending
this is nothing
I'd tell you I miss you
but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite
this loud
Now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they careless
But I liked it better
when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather
love than fight
So many things that you
wish I knew but the story of us
might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy NOW NOW NOW YEAH
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's killing me yeah
And I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy now

Haunted,"1,571",Taylor Swift,"You and I walk a fragile line

like it's all a big mistake

Won't lose you again

Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on come on

I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean
every word I say to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing
he was you instead
Oh holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me
holding on to nothing
Come on come on
Don't leave me like this

Long Live,"1,312",Taylor Swift,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our
shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced
like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls
we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that
we stood there
On the side lines
wishing for right now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your
baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we help them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming this is absurd
Cause for a moment a
band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to
rule the world
Long live the walls
we crashed through
How the kingdom lights
shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the
mountains we moved
I had the time of
my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long
live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on
Just spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Can you take a moment
promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate
should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds
went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls
we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we
crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing long live all
the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
Long long live the
look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered"

Little Girl,118,Kira Isabella,"Hey little girl, braids in your hair
Big bad world but you ain't scared, no
��Cause nobody's gone and told ya
To shut up, play nice, do what you're told

What I’m Leaving For,29,Lady A,"Keep those lights on
Toys on the front lawn
Disney World trip next summer
Used kit for our little air-drummer
Food on the table
Brand new cradle
For the angel that's coming in a minute
This house and everybody in it

Got my bags packed, got my ticket
Got a heartache to go with it
Baby, kiss me, say you'll miss me
Oh, while we still got time

Chorus
Take a look at our little paradise
It ain't much but baby, you and I
Picked the right stars, made the right wish
Ain't nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
That every time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for

Verse 2
When I'm out there
I know I'm where
I'm meant to be picking them strings
And getting that small town to sing
On that last turn home
I can hardly wait
To drop my bags, kiss your face
'Cause all I can do is stop and

Take a look at our little paradise

You know that this heart of mine is yours
You know that this heart is yours
Oh, and every time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for

Waste of Lime,"1,868",Ingrid Andress,"We had some fun
we had some laughs
I licked the salt
right off the glass
Danced to the music
racked up a tab
I thought you were thinking
what I was thinking
Thought we were going somewhere
with all this drinking
Well I guess the Cuervo
it led me on
'Cause I turned around
and you were gone
You're just a waste of lime
Waste of a real good time
I guess I'll be going home
all alone
No Patron Silver lining
Just an empty margarita
Left me and this tequila
high and dry
No drunk pickup lines
No Your place or mine
You're just a waste of lime
Bermuda Bahama
guess I'm never gonna
Meet your mama or brother
nothin' left to do
Well I'd take a kiss
no second date
And I'd take a two-mile
in-the-rain walk of shame
Yeah that'd be great
compared to this
Oh baby what a miss
You're just a waste of lime
Waste of a real good time
I guess I'll be going home

Meet your mama or brother

don't need ya nah

Christmas Isn't Christmas,"1,592",Dan + Shay,"Every city street
Would be celebrating
All the evergreens
Would be decorated
And there'd still be a million lights
There'd still be mistletoe
But it wouldn't feel the same
'Cause all I know is
Christmas isn't Christmas
if it's not with you
Red and green and silver bells
would all be blue
All the presents are just boxes
with no one to give them to
'Cause Christmas isn't Christmas

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
It'd be just a day
at the end of December
And a lonely night
if you and I weren't together
And those songs wouldn't
sound the same
Home wouldn't feel like home
I'm thankful you're here tonight

Christmas isn't Christmas

Out Of Hand,203,Pat Burgener,"Hold on to things
that make you stronger
You know love is right
around the corner
We fall by the wayside
Keep hanging on a cloud
Ouh ouh ouh ouh
Too young to be right
Soon too old to fight
Ouh ouh ouh
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado
And let it all get out of hand
Sitting by the water
Time feels right
Better run fast enough
while you still can
Hold on your fingers on a trigger
Run far
won’t keep on waiting longer
Heading to the seaside
We know we’ll be fine
Ouh ouh ouh ouh
Ready for the fight
Ain’t too late to be right
Ouh ouh ouh
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado
And let it all get out of hand
Sitting by the water
Time feels right
Better run fast enough
while you still can
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado

Better run fast enough

Better run far
While you can ooh

Song About It,227,Kings Of Convenience,"Talk about it, dream about it
Joke about it, worry about it
Lie about it, laugh about it
Leaning on it, learning about it
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
All we know is
that the feelings are strong
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
It all depends
which side you are on
Shy about it, cry about it
Ask about it, honest about it
Taken by it, shaken by it
Aching a bit
when you're denied of it
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
All we know is
that the feelings are strong
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
It all depends
which side you are on
And now we got to know it,
how can we erase?
How can we un-know it? Love
Although it may upset you,
you chose me just as much
And I should just forget you, no"
Kayla,90,Stephen Sanchez,"Eyes of brown
Beautiful and she's so warm to just be around
My heart, it pounds
That she is more than a pretty face lost in the crowd

Won't you lie next to me, oh, Kayla?
Won't you lie next to me, oh, Kayla?
Won't you lie next to me, oh, Kayla?
Won't you lie, oh, next to me, okay love?
Okay

[Verse 2]
Rose-like cheeks
You'll tell me I'm wrong and that's just because you don't like what you see
Just know I do and
All of the time, you're on my mind, making me blind

Won't you lie next to me, oh, Kayla?
Won't you lie next to me, oh, Kayla?

I Know a Place,161,Chevy,"I know a place
That's sound and safe
For us now
No need to hide
Or say goodbyes
Leave them out
We'll run away
It'll be okay
Hmm
Bum bah dum dum
We can chase waterfalls
And talk 'til all my hair dries
Just lie on the sand
Each hand in hand
In paradise
'Cause we don't got long
'Til we say so long
Hmm
Dum dah dum dum dah duh duh dum dah
We can live in this lovely dream
It'll be my reality
Hmm
I know a place
That has no trace
Of us now
It's just a thought
So don't tell me it's wrong"
simple times,311,Kacey Musgraves,"Every day felt like Friday
Walking to the 7-Eleven
Me and all of my best friends
We were always together
I remember talking on the phone
all night
Didn't know it was a simple time
Wish that I could
put this game on pause
Skip this round
take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like
there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kinda sucks
And I'm really just
missing the simple times ah-ha
I think I'm going off
of the deep end
I wanna wake up on an island
Throw еverybody a peace sign
Put all thе static on silent
We can stay up all night
Pour one out for the simple times
Wish that I could
put this game on pause
Skip this round
take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like
there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kinda sucks
And I'm really just
missing the simple times ah-ha
There's nothing really going on
But I heard about a rager
I won't be waiting by the phone
So you can hit me on the pager
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Wish that I could
put this game on pause
Skip this round
take the headset off
Put my high-tops on
Kick it at the mall like
there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just
missing the simple times ah-ha

Heads Look Like Drums,21,James Vincent McMorrow,"Crystal vibration
Down by the boardwalk
Stock up on mood rings
Elephant-shaped rock
We both stopped drinkin'
We still have fun
'Cause LA is sinkin'
So fight everyone
We fight everyone
We fight everyone
We fight everyone
We fight everyone
White birds in motion
Down by the sea
Band on the pavement
Playing Britney
I never noticed
The weight of this song
We stop to listen
I sing along
We sing along
We sing along
We sing along
We sing along
Then we go out late at night
We’re not that brave
but we're high
Try not to hurt anyone
Then you stand on my shoulders
You're high enough to see
all the serial killers
Heads look like drums
of you squint the right way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Drugs they start working
We know what to do
We end up on Sunset
We must look confused
A man tries to help us
And asks if we're safe
We both start laughing
'Cause it's way too late
It's way too late
It's way too late
It's way too late
It's way too late
Then we go home late at night
We're not that safe
but we're fine
We're seeing how far we can run
When I stand on your shoulders
I'm high enough to see
all the serial killers
Heads look like drums
of you squint the right way
Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

And I'm never gonna
waste your love on me

I don't wanna text, I don't wanna talk, I don't wanna call you back
I just wanna live, I just wanna love, feel just a little less bad
So I, I get high

I could be out with a stranger
Home with someone I love
Could be when I'm feeling good or feel like I'm not enough
So I, I get high

Wanna stay awake, wanna stay asleep
Anything to pass the time
Sick of growing up, sick of being young
I just wanna feel alive
So I, oh I, I fly

It's when I'm home with my family
Or I'm out on the road
I'm the center of attention or completely alone
That's why

To Be A Man,61,Dax,"I can't hide myself
I don't expect you to understand
I just hope I can explain
What it's like to be a man
It's a lonely road
And they don't care 'bout what you know
It's not 'bout how you feel
But what you provide inside that home
Yeah, I know this life can really beat you down, uh
You wanna scream but you won't make a sound, uh
Got so much weight that you've been holdin'
But won't show any emotion, as a man, that goes unspoken
That we can't cry when life gets hard
Unconditional love for women, children and dogs
We know that we just have to play our parts
And don't nobody give a damn about our broken hearts, yeah
As a man, we gotta pave our way
Our only function is to work and slave
There's no respect for you if you ain't paid
You're disregarded as a human and you can't complain
And if you ever make it up and actually reach that place
And find a woman that you love and give her your last name
You'll feel the things that you provide is only why she stays
And when you try to explain, you'll say
I can't hide myself
I don't expect you to understand
I just hope I can explain
What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)
It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)
And they don't care 'bout what you know (care 'bout what you know)
It's not 'bout how you feel
But what you provide inside that home
Don't give up, keep fightin'
As a man, our son is our horizon
And our fathers' actions play a role and we end up like him
So they can't let us see them hurt
'Cause we'll embody what we do and start a generational curse
No wonder most men are so depressed
All the things that they can't express
They go to war, get thrown on the shelf
Then go back to war with they mental health
Then grab that bottle and ask for help
Try to pull themselves out of hell
Then fall back down and then realize
That they gon' have to do it themselves
It's the circle of life, as a man, you provide
They don't know what you're worth 'til the day that you die
And that's when they start cryin'
Then move on to a man to confide in
That's why we feel
We can't hide ourselves
We don't expect you to understand
We just hope we can explain
What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)
It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)
And you don't care 'bout what we know (care 'bout what we know)
It's not 'bout how we feel
But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)
That home
It's not 'bout how we feel
But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)"

"Everywhere, Everything",118,Noah Kahan,"Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's been a long year
Would we survive in a horror movie?
I doubt it, we're too slow moving
We trust everyone we meet
Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat
And stare at a drive-in screen
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
Everywhеrе, everything, I wanna lovе you
'Til we'rе food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
(Mm-hmm-mm) Drive slowly,
I know every route in this county
And maybe that ain't such a bad thing
I'll tell where not to speed
And it's been a long year
And all of our book's pages dog-eared
We write out the ends on our palms, dear
Then forget to read
And we couldn't know that
the sun was collapsing
Until the seas rose and
the buildings came crashing
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hand in yours
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hand in yours

In A Little While (Demo),64,Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds,"The tune that I'm singing
I might have borrowed
The truth that I'm telling
Might not be true
The gifts that I bring
They might be stolen
But I'm here right now
And I will give them to you
They say that it's over
Well I don't believe it
They tell me it's gone
But that can't be true
And if it's lost
Well I'm gonna find it
Turn me a page
Let's start anew
Lend me your ears
And I'll sing you a secret
If you take my hand
I'll get you there
I give you my word
And this time I mean it
But if you turn me away
Save me a prayer
They say that it's over
Well I don't believe it
They tell me it's gone
But that can't be true
And if it's lost
Well I'm gonna find it
Turn me a page
Let's start anew
Yesterdays gone
And I'm right behind it
The storm when it comes
Let it rain down on me
It's sad and it's true
But you laid it on the line
And in a little while
You'll be free
In a little while
We'll be free
In a little while
We'll be free
In a little while
We'll be free"

Surprise Ice,398,Kings Of Convenience,"when past sometimes takes
you with soft hands
forcelessly pulls you to your chair
hides you away from these half days
sunless at the end of the year
the air is like a knife
cutting through you
a room in the house is always
warm stretched out
on the bathroom floor thinking
of fair days your future may hold

love comes like surprise ice
on the water
love comes like surprise ice at dawn
love comes like surprise ice
on the water
love comes at dawn

deprived of the light and of colours
the world ends at your
windowtree darkness creates
these illusions
but pale days can teach you to see
rain falls but no life is given
weeks pass no progress is made
past sometimes takes you
with soft hands
and all that surrounds you will fade

love comes like surprise ice
on the water
love comes like surprise ice at dawn
love comes like surprise ice
on the water
love comes at dawn"
Change (Taylor’s Version),556,Taylor Swift,"Well it's a sad picture
the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets
what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same
another time and place
Repeating history and
you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to
hold us back will fall down
This revolution
the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah
we'll sing hallelujah
Oh oh
So we've been outnumbered
raidеd and now cornered
It's hard to fight
when thе fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
finding things they never found
They might be bigger
but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away
say we don't need this
But there’s something in your eyes
says we can beat this
’Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to
hold us back will fall down
This revolution
the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
we’ll sing hallelujah
Oh oh
Tonight we'll stand
get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked
for all these years
And the battle was long
it's the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
When the walls that they put up to
hold us back fell down
It's a revolution
throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah
we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah"

Blue,798,Joni Mitchell,"Blue songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea betore
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Hey blue here is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well there're so many sinking now
You've got to keep thinking
You can make it thru these waves
Acid booze and ass
Needles guns and grass
Lots of laughs lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that
hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a
look around it though
Blue I love you
Blue here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me"

Beer For My Horses (Feat. Willie Nelson),23,Toby Keith,"Well a man come on the 6 olock news
Said somebody been shot,
somebody been abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn get too far yeah
They didn get too far
Grandpappy told my pappy,
back in my day, son
A man had to answer
for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree,
round up all of them bad boys
Hang them high in the street for
all the people to see that
Justice is the one thing
you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles
we l sing a victory tune
We l all meet back at the local saloon
We l raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men,
beer for my horses
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
too much crime in the streets
It time the long arm of the law put
a few more in the ground
Send all to their maker and he l settle down
You can bet he l set down ause
Justice is the one thing
you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles
we l sing a victory tune
We l all meet back at the local saloon
We l raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men,
beer for my horses
whiskey for my men,

Coward Of The County,246,Kenny Rogers,"Ev'ryone considered him
the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time
to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy
the folks just called him yellow
But something always told me
they were reading Tommy wrong
He was only ten years old
when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy
'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words
my brother said to Tommy
Son my life is over
but yours is just begun
Promise me son
not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble
if you can
It won't mean you're weak
if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough
to understand
Son you don't have to fight
to be a man
There's someone for ev'ryone
and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have
to prove he was a man
One day while he was workin'
the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky
There was three of them
Tommy opened up the door
and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress
the shattered look was more
than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace
and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face
he heard these words again
Promise me son
not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble
if you can
It won't mean you're weak
if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough
to understand
Son you don't have to fight
to be a man
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him
halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned
around they said
Hey look ol' yellow's leavin'
But you coulda heard a pin drop
when Tommy stopped and
blocked the door
Twenty years of crawlin'
was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin' nothin' back
he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom
not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said This one's for Becky
as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say
I promised you Dad
not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble
when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak
I didn't turn the other cheek
and Papa
I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight
when you're a man
Ev'ryone considered him
the coward of the county"
"Mrs. Robinson (From ""The Graduate"" Soundtrack)",283,Simon & Garfunkel,"And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson

Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes

Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes

It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair

Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids



Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson

Jesus loves you more than you will know

Renegade,647,Kings Of Convenience,"I`m letting go
To see if you`ll hold on to me
I`m in doubt
Of what is thought
and what is real
In our room
Between the shapes
I thought I knew
A guillotine
A pillow with feathers like snow
I`ve come
To a listening post
beyond your lines
I`m all ears
To gather clues and look for signs
But I can`t hear
The song you sing
while you try to soothe
Why are you whispering
While the bombs are falling
Go easy on me
I can`t help what I`m doing
Go easy on me
Oh I can`t help what I`m doing
Hello again
I buried you where have you been
My renegade
You came back from the labyrinth
Unlike me
You`ve looked for things
that could be found
And the thread
That guides through black times
Go easy on me
I can`t help what I`m doing
Go easy on me
Oh I can`t help what I`m doing
When thoughts
Had outnumbered spoken words
In the early hours
We failed to establish
Who was hurt
Most"
Peacetime Resistance,"1,184",Kings Of Convenience,"Feeling the comfort of
eyes is your sole intention.
We all want to be understood
unconditionally.
But you have to realize
that a viewer needs distance.
And the moment your wall
melts down-the inside is outside.
Maybe way back in the past
when people different,
shortening bonds made them last.
Now we emphasize our difference.
We have been enrolled one by one
for the Peacetime Resistance.
and we're fighting our battles alone.
We've got four eyes-so why
yearn for one perspective?
We've got colours
with shades erased
when blended
We've got four eyes
so why yearn for one perspective?
We've got colours,
but they disappear when blended."
Love Will Take You,900,Angus & Julia Stone,"If we never found this love
If we never took that road
If we hadn`t had the heart

Love love will take you there
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
In this world the heart beats slow
In my arms let`s share the cold
In my eyes your all I`ve known
Darlin let`s go home
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Love love will take you

Nancy From Now On,90,Father John Misty,"Oh pour me another drink
And punch me in the face
You can call me Nancy
Every man wears a symbol
And I know I have mine
I've got my right hand stamped
In the concentration camp
where my organs scream slow down man
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below
Oh hook me up to the tank
And roll me to the door
I'm going where my body leads me
I can fend for myself
With what looks I have left
I'll put away a few
And pretty soon
I'll be breaking things I have of you
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below
Forgive me how it was
A place under the sun
Before the devil made me run
Run boy run boy"

Don't Die Curious,114,Tom Rosenthal,"You can't right click on a face
You can't be the winner of
the human race
You can't do everything in this place
But don't die curious
You can't be the healer of every soul
You can't be the Queen all on your own
You can't beat the nighttime
with a glow
But don't die curious
You can't count every single
grain of sand
You can't save a heart
by holding a hand
You can't make everyone understand
But don't die curious
Hello words that I just did not say
I found a way to hesitate, to deviate
Oh, we just died curious
You can't be a runner with a broken toe
You can't paint a painting
like Van Gogh
You can't pronounce
everything right, you know?
But don't die curious
You can't move a mountain in a beat
You can't find the truth of
everyone you meet
You can't kiss a stranger in the street
But don't die curious
Hello words that I just did not say
I found a way to hesitate, to deviate
Oh, we just died curious
You can't change a mind
without a fight
Waiting for the hope of a morning light
You can't find love on your own tonight
Hello life that I just did not do
Ignored the clues, I ran from you
I found the blues
Oh, we just died
Hello words that I just did not say
I found a way to hesitate, to deviate
Oh, we just died curious"
It's a Beautiful Day,449,Evan McHugh,"Outside outside it's cold

It's a beautiful day

The sky's a brighter blue
It's a beautiful day

These old knees they tell me
Thunder's on the way
But if you could
come a little closer
That's all I would need
April showers become
distant memories
It's a beautiful day

It's a beautiful day
to be with you
Oh when I see your face it's true
The sky's a brighter blue
It's a beautiful day
to be with you
So why don't you
come a little closer
Until those skies are clear
And we can watch
our troubles disappear

More Than My Hometown,627,Morgan Wallen,"Girl our mamas are best friends

Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep
and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real
world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called
I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all
packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more
than a California sunset
More than a beer
when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor
lost souls 'round
and Hallelujah bound
Yeah I love you more
than the feeling
when the bass
hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl
at the end of the book
But baby this might
be the last time
I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more
than my hometown
I ain't the runaway kind
I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these
streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame man
to think that
I love you more
than a California sunset
More than a beer
when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls
around and Hallelujah bound
Yeah I love you more
than the feeling
when the bass
hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl
at the end of the book
But baby
this might be the last time
I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more
than my hometown
Yeah you got a wild
in your eyes
that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup
of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill
girl not in 'em
So hang onto these words
'til them avenues help
you forget 'em
'Cause I love you more
than a California sunset
I love you more
in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car
you got your keys in
Girl but I hate even more
that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more
than the feeling
when the bass
hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl
at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so
I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more
than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more baby love you more"

down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes
looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing
before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in
and whispered to you
Come on baby with me
we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to
crying and screaming Why
Flowers pile up in the worst way
no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted
if you were still here
I remember the last day
when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
Come on baby with me
we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room
and this hospital gray
we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
What if I'm standing in your closet
trying to talk to you
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs
you won't grow into
And what if I really thought
some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was
even getting one moment with you
Come on baby with me
we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me
we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

Picture To Burn,222,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

What will it take to show you
that it's not the life it seems
I told you time and time again
You sing the words
but don't know what it means
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as
we both shook for the last time
Take a good hard look
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

True,79,Ten Towers,"[Verse 1]

As so many times before
I never wanna be [missing word] leave you again

If only I could do one thing, I'll be with you

Hysteria,2,Indigo Sparke,"One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hysteria in the morning flush
In the vapid rush
Hysteria, hold me down
These rivers in my eyes
Hysteria, I love you
Don't wanna go home
Hysteria don't know how to grow
This winter chills my bones

[Chorus]
Silver diamond threads, they travel
Watch my, watch my soul unravel

[Verse 2]
Hysteria in the weightless crush
Wanna hold you so much
Hysteria in the weightless crush
Wanna hold you so much
Hysteria, now it's time to leave
And I cannot feel my hands
Hysteria, you're telling me to breathe
I'm going to the promised lands

[Chorus]
Silvеr diamond threads, they travel
Watch my, watch my soul unravеl

[Verse 3]
Hysteria in the vacant numb
Hysteria, we've gone too far
Hysteria in the swelling dream
Hysteria in the silent screams
Hysteria, don't let go
Hysteria, come to me
Hysteria, I'm so sorry
Hysteria let love please

[Chorus]
Silver diamond threads, they travel
Watch, watch my soul unravel"
Everything I Love,30,Morgan Wallen,"I wish I would've met you anywhere but where I did
Some old high rise town that I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around In some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like

[Pre-Chorus]
We were listenin' to One More Silver Dollar
Hanging out my Silverado
Down a road I love to ride

[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Verse 2]
I don't care how much they're bitin'
I won't even crank thе boat
Soon as that bobber hits the water
Girl, your mеmory starts to float
Baby, why'd l ever take the bait
And take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know

[Pre-Chorus]
I even took you to my hometown to meet my Mama
Now, I'm gonna see you every time
I see that welcome sign

[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hear One More Silver Dollar
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride

[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Chorus]
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey
'Cause you used to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck
And now, I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love"

Treacherous,483,Taylor Swift,"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I will follow you
follow you home
Follow you follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I I-I-I I-I-I
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I will follow you
follow you home
Follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
Follow you follow you home
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it"
You’re Not Sorry (Taylor’s Version),629,Taylor Swift,"All this time I was wasting
hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances
every time and all you
do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby
but I've figured you out
And you're thinking
we'll be fine again
but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
like I did before
You're not sorry
No no oh-oh
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you
if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
if you hadn't lеft me
waiting in the cold
And you've got your sharе of secrets
And I'm tired of being
last to know oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to
call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
like I did before
You're not sorry
No no oh-oh
You're not sorry
No no oh-oh
You had me crawling
for you honey
And it never
would've gone away no
You used to shine so bright
but I watched all of it fade
So you don't have
to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
like I did before
You're not sorry
No no oh-oh
You're not sorry
No no oh-oh
No no no no no no
no no no no no no
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh no no no no no no"
The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),556,Taylor Swift,"I'm five years old
it's getting cold
I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and
look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
on the way home
I don't know why all the trees
change in the fall
But I know you're not scared
of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house
is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
could be so mean
I come home crying and you
hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive
until we found a town
far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to
talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long
it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
with you today
I have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found from back
when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate
ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady
in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees
change in the fall
I know you were on my side even
when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today"
Change,780,Taylor Swift,"And it's a sad picture
the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you
wanted again and You know
it's all the same another time
and place Repeating history
and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it
through Because these things
will change Do you feel it now
These walls that they put up
to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will
come For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah
we sing hallelujah

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight
when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger But we're
faster and never scared
You can walk away
say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
Because these things will change
Do you feel it now
These walls that they put up
to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah
we sing hallelujah

Tonight we stand
get off our knees Fight for what
we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long
it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Do you see it now
These walls that they put up
to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution
throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sang hallelujah
we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah"
Take My Time,31,Helen Austin,"I can get caught on the other side
On the other side of the line

On the other side of the line

All the things I gave away
I gave everything I had
All the things that came my way we not so bad

I can get caught on the other side
On the other side of the line
I got to take my time

Madrid,392,Elsa Kopf,"I'm not always right
mostly I'm wrong
I'm half of a joke
and half of a sad song
when the sun sets at night
over the hill top
you can see my shadow dancing
we drink a few drinks
and sing a few songs
and share a few looks
and then I'll be gone
as the moon shines bright
over the hill top
you can see my shadow dancing
I love you like I love Madrid
it's a place I've never been
but it's such a pretty dream
you
and the morning
and the sound of Spain
you
and the morning
and the sound of Spain"
Naked As We Came (Album),802,iron & wine,"She says
Wake up it's no use pretending
I'll keep stealing breathing her
Birds are leaving
over autumn's ending
One of us will die
inside these arms
Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes
'round the yard
She says
If I leave before you darling
Don't you waste me in the ground
I lay smiling
like our sleeping children
One of us will die
inside these arms
Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes
'round the yard"

I really thought that I loved you and you know that
You say that you've had all your fun
You've just got to believe me that I never meant to hurt you
But I can't believe you've been gone
This is the hardest thing that I've ever had to do and it hurts me too
As soon as I hang up the phone yeah I'll be gone
As soon as I hang up the phone goodbye Loretta"

"If You Need To, Keep Time On Me",138,Fleet Foxes,"How could it all fall in one day
Were we too sure of the sun
If you need to keep time on me
If you need to keep time on me
Who knows what state is in store
If they all turn will you run
If you need to keep time on me
If you need to keep time on me

All I can do is wish you well"
What Is This Thing Called Love,103,Willie Nelson,"What is this thing called love

To drive around in

That I walk about In

If I could I'd buy
You a house in laurel canyon
Underneath the moon above
In the shade of the mountain
I walk around
Life's been hard and you've lived a few
Did I give too much love to you
I'm sorry but it's what I had to do
You needed love
I needed you
Back in my hometown
Looking for a silver Honda
But there's too many all around
And I fear I'll never find you
So I walk around
Hoping that one day
I'll see you driving up my street again
On your grandpa's bicycle
With your long hair blowing in the wind
And we'll walk around
Life's been hard and you've lived a few
Did I give too much love to you
I'm sorry but it's what I had to do
You needed love
I needed you

Did I give too much love to you
I'm sorry but it's what I had to do

Well maybe you need space from me

Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside

Sand In My Boots,359,Morgan Wallen,"She asked me where I was from
I said Somewhere
you never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville
Headin' by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops
by my Red Wings on the beach
Yeah but now I'm dodging
potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way she
kissed me tells me
she loves Eastern Tennessee
Yeah but all I brought back
with me was some sand in my boots
I said Let's go shoot tequila
So we walked back
to that beach bar
She said
Don't cowboy's drink whiskey huh
So we drank bottom shelf
She said
Damn that sky looks perfect
I said Girl you've never seen
stars like the ones back home
And she said
Maybe I should see them
for myself
Yeah but now I'm dodging
potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way she
kissed me tells me
she loves Eastern Tennessee
Yeah but all I brought back
with me was some sand in my boots
I said Meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah but I still thought
that maybe she'd show up
Ah but now I'm dodging potholes
in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way
she kissed me tells me

Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said
When can I-I-I come back
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when
when it's sunny or storming
Laughing when I'm crying
And that's when

That's when when I see your face
I'll let you in and baby

When you said I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this

waiting at the front gate
And that's when
when I saw your face
You let me in and baby
that's when
That's when
when I wake up in the morning
Yeah
That's when
when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting
at the front gate
That when I miss you
that's when I want you
That's when when I see your face
That's when I love you
that's when"
Killers,117,Kings Of Convenience,"Killers, won't you come here
and kill some time?
I've been sentenced to wait here
for hours and days
Till when maybe she will be mine
The lies that you made up
to hide your crime
I could have used some to tell myself
she would come
In a more reassuring tone
The darkness that you carry
inside your hearts
And the freedom it gives
to let die or let live
When your play only has one part
In my play, my part is only one of two
What will happen to me
is not up to me
It depends on what she will choose
Rain that falls upon my window
An infinite circle, drops of the miracle
That brought you into my life
Love is not only what I feel for you
It's the spine and the posture
that's been keeping me upright
Since the day when I fell for you
Sheets between
which I'm trying to sleep
Have the sweetest of smell,
it's of you, I can tell
And that's all I now have of you
It's the blood that heals the wound"

Now You Don`t,31,Ocie Elliott,"You are drivin', amber lights down the road
Yellow lines and the horizon looks cold
Been goin' all night now,
your darkness is goin'
And you've felt your day's been glidin' on
And the year's almost gone
You had something tyin' you down
Now you don't
Mmm-hmm, tarada, tarada
I am off now to get back there to you, mmm
Picture the mornin'
when your door I come through
And you're in bed still,
stirrin' like you were before
Like when I left you, and flew off
And I've been away for far too long
Stuck in another time zone
I had something tyin' me down
Now I don't
Mmm-hmm, tarada, tarada
Now I don't

Chasin' You,126,Morgan Wallen,"We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom
Chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me
I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you
Still chasin' you
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom
Chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me
I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you
Still chasin' you
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom
Chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me
I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you
Still chasin' you
Still chasin' you

Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version),470,Taylor Swift,"Long handwritten note
deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean
when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks
your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful they'll be
and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic
love affair
What a sad beautiful
tragic love affair
In dreams
I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds
different cities
And time is taking
its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling they all look like me
'Cause we had a beautiful
magic lovе there
What a sad beautiful
tragic lovе affair
Distance timing
breakdown fighting
Silence
the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it
could you just try to listen
Hang up give up
and for the life of us
we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic
beautiful tragic beautiful
What we had a beautiful
magic love there
What a sad beautiful
tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic
love there
What a sad beautiful
tragic love affair"
State Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor's Version),471,Taylor Swift,"I'm walking fast
through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and
our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shadеs of wrong
We learn to live with thе pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of
something good and right and real
And I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same oh
Oh I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"

Brown Eyes Baby,56,Keith Urban,"Verse 1
You made up your mind, got off the couch
You did up your hair, now you're goin' out
You put on that party dress
Even though your heart's a mess
Your friends swung by, you jumped in the car
You walked in here and now here we are
Puttin' the hurtin' on some José
And catchin' up while the band plays
You say you miss the girl you used to be
Bet I can find her if you let me

Chorus
I can put the smile right back where your smile goes
Dreams back in what you see when your eyes close
I'll be the buzz that you feel when you sip slow
Slow dancе right back in your dirt road
I can put the sun right back in your sunshine
Bring a little lovе back into your late night
Ain't gotta be nothin' more than one more drink
And maybe I can take the blue out of your brown eyes, baby

Verse 2
And that wild side that you learned to tame
She'll roll in like a midnight train
Almost like she never left here
And I'll be ready, baby, when she gets here

Chorus
I can put the smile right back where your smile goes
Dreams back in what you see when your eyes close
I'll be the buzz that you feel when you sip slow
Slow dance right back in your dirt road
I can put the sun right back in your sunshine
Bring a little love back into your late night
Ain't gotta be nothin' more than one more drink
And maybe I can take the blue out of your brown eyes, baby Woo
Mm, mm-mm
Oh yeah

Bridge
Put the full back in your half empty
And put the two in your step again
About to see where leanin' in gets me
Baby, just say when

Chorus
'Cause I can put the smile right back where your smile goes
Dreams back in what you see when your eyes close
I'll be the buzz that you feel when you sip slow
Slow dance right back in your dirt road
I can put the sun right back in your sunshine
Bring a little love back into your late night
Ain't gotta be nothin' more than one more drink
And maybe I can take the blue out of your brown eyes, baby
Mm
Take the blue out of your brown eyes, baby
Oh, oh, oh, hey

Outro
Oh, yeah
I'll take the blue
Take the blue out of your brown eyes, baby
Take the blue
I'll take the blue right out of your brown eyes, baby"
Set For Life,139,Noah Cyrus,"See the gold up in the hills?
It's got nothing to do with us
And eventually,

Or, the world will stand in still
Standin' still for the two of us

Running Out,2,Izzy Heltai,"I’m tired
And broken
But i was
Still hoping
That i’d finally
Catch my break

Found jesus
Not really
But they say that could heal this
Empty feeling
In my chest

I thought I
Was running out of luck
But my lucks been pretty great
The past few weeks
Have really felt like a lot
My bitter feelings
Leaving space for some change

It’s not likely
To happen
These dreams that i’ve been chasing
Since i was a
Little kid

Was useless
In highschool
Smoked too much pot
To do much
Useful activity
But i’m growing up now
You’ll see

I thought I
Was running out of luck
But my lucks been pretty great
The past few weeks
Have really felt like a lot
My bitter feelings
Leaving space for some change
I’m tired
Not useless
I’ve grown up
But truth is
I’m lying
When i say
I’m not afraid

I’m tired
Not useless
I’ve grown up

Down in the Willow Garden (feat. Brandi Carlile),16,Rufus Wainwright,"Down in the willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we set there a courtin'
My love fell off to sleep

I had a bottle of burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below

I drew a saber through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sight

My father oft had told me
That money would set me free

If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly

My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high

My race is run beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly"

A Running Start,73,Sufjan Stevens,"If I imagine myself peaceful
On the fire escape
Head first, my hands inside my
T-shirt, as we run away
So now we have a running start
My body moves in mystic ways
I cross my arms to shield my heart
As everything turns into waves

I see the light upon the lake
The silver moon, the water snake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish

If I align myself with Pisces
In a funny way
Can you, my lover, kiss my bracelet
And my shoulder blades
We’ve always had a running start
I jump between the trampolines
You throw your arms around my heart
As if to say you’re all I need

The winter pines, the lonely drake
The light beneath the frozen lake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish"
Holy Ground,472,Taylor Swift,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
and Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance
feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems
like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than
a green light go
Hey you skip the conversation
when you already know
I left a note on the door
with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl
in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city
all to ourselves
We blocked the noise
with the sound of
I need you
And for the first time
I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart
in the usual way
And the story's got dust
on every page
But sometimes
I wonder how you
think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
'Cause darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you"

The Greatest Bastard,"3,361",Damien Rice,"I made you laugh, I made you cry
I made you open up your eyes, didn't I
I helped you open up your wings
Your legs, and many other things, didn't I
Am I the greatest bastard that you know
The only one who let you go
Or the one you hurt so much you cannot bear
We were good when we were good
When we were not misunderstood
You helped me love, you helped me live
You helped me learn how to forgive, didn't you
I wish that I could say the same
But when you left, you left the blame, didn't you
Am I the greatest bastard that you met
The only one you can't forget
Am I the one your truth's been waiting for
Or am I just dreaming once again
Some dreams are better when they end
Some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some ret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down
We learned to wag and tuck our tails
We learned to win and then to fail, didn't we
We learned that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling, didn't we
Am I the greatest bastard that you know
When will we learn to let this go
We fought so much we've broken all the charm
But letting go is not the same as pushing someone else away
So please don't let on you don't know me
Please don't let on I'm not here
Please don't let on you don't love me, cause I know you do
I know
That some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
But I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
But I never meant to let you down
I never meant to let you
I never meant to let you down
I never meant"

Forever & Always (Piano Version) (Taylor’s Version),529,Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me
you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always
Oh oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that
cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
but I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all

Oh oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so oh
Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone

And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all

Old Love,297,Eric Clapton,"I can feel your body
When I'm lying in my bed
too much confusion
Going around through my head
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns

Why can't I get over
When will I ever learn

Old love

leave me alone

Old love

just go on home

I can see your face

But I know that
it's not real
It's just an illusion

Caused by how I used to feel
And it makes me so angry
I know that the
flame will always burn
flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that
I'll never learn
Old love
Old love
leave me alone

Old love

just go on home

Old love

just go on home on home

Old love

Old love

"Strange Things (From ""Toy Story""/Soundtrack Version)",712,Randy Newman,"I was on top of the world living high

It was right in my pocket

I was living the life

Things were just the way they should be

When from out of the sky like a bomb

Comes some little punk in a rocket

Now all of a sudden

Some strange things are happening to me



I had friends

I had lots of friends

Now all my friends are gone

And i'm doing the best i can to carry on

I had power

I was respected

But not anymore

And i've lost the love

Of the one who i adore

Let me tell you about it



Strange things are happening to me

Strange things

Strange things are happening to me

Ain't no doubt about it



You got someone you think you know well

Who turns out a stranger

The minute you turn your back

You're in it all by yourself

They laugh of your jokes

You think you're doing quite well

But you're in danger boy

You end up alone forgotten

Way up on the shelf



Strange things are happening to me

Strange things

Strange things are happening to me

Ain't no doubt about it



Strange things are happening to me

Strange things

Strange things are happening to me

Look how far we've come my baby"
The Hill,"2,519",Marketa Irglova,"Walking up the hill tonight
and you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
all those mistakes and be wise
But please try to be patient
and know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to
see the strength inside of me burning

Where are you my angel
now don't you see me crying
And I know that you can't do it all
but you can't say I'm not trying
I'm on my knees in front of him
but he doesn't seem to see me
But all his troubles on his mind
he's looking right for me
And I'm letting myself down in satisfying you
And I wish that you could see I have my troubles too

Looking at your sleeping
I'm with the man I know
I'm sitting here weeping
while the hours pass so slow
And I know that in the morning
I have to let you go
And you be just a man once I used to know
And for these past few days
someone I don't recognise
This isn't all my fault hurt when you realise

Looking at your leaving
I'm looking for a sign"
Riot On An Empty Street,526,Kings Of Convenience,"Why, why so quiet?

Oh my, mysterious country singer? she asked.



My life, it`s a riot

I`m climbing barricades

in empty streets at night.



When I`m down

fighting shadows.

Twenty-five postcards

in a box in my room.



Telephone conversations,

gas slowly leaking out

of a heart-shaped balloon.



It`s a dangerous game

that I`m not sure

if I could keep playing for long.



It`s a dangerous game,

it`s a very fine line

and if one step is wrong...



I have no cards to play

and that`s why



I`ve got nothing to say,

tonight.



I`ve got nothing to say,

tonight."
So Weightless,"2,549",David Choi,"I only know not everyone sees
Something there beyond the breeze
A lioness stare blond wavy hair
Beautiful so hard not to care
Every move I make
gets closer to you
Reach your hand out
Should I grab or should I go
I'm feeling so weightless
I don't know what
I don't know how
I ended up in this cloud
I'm feeling so helpless
I don't know when
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get down
I got a question
can I stay for a while
I'm liking it here
but am I on file
I just want to talk
but you seem so far
Fading away just like a star
Before you could answer
You've drifted away
Left me here alone
but right now I'm feeling ok
I'm feeling so weightless
I don't know what
I don't know how
I ended up in this cloud
I'm feeling so helpless
I don't know when
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get down
Before I know it
I can't help but wonder
My friends are waiting for me
but if I could just stay here
So caught up in bliss
where is my answer
I'm feeling so weightless
I don't know what
I don't know how
I ended up in this cloud
I'm feeling so helpless
I don't know when
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get down
Feelin so weightless
Feelin so weightless"
Enchanted,"2,589",Taylor Swift,"There I was again tonight
forcing laughter
faking smiles Same old tired
lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was
enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered
have we met
Across the room your silhouette
starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you

All I can say is I was
enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering queestion
kept me up
2AM who do you love
I wonder to I'm right awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to met you

All I know is I was
enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew

This night is flawless
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
until I see you again
These are the words
I held back as I was
leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love
with someone else
Please don't have somebody
waiting on you
Please don't be in love
with someone else
Please don't have somebody
waiting on you
This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew

This night is flawless
don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering
if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love
with someone else
Please don't have somebody
waiting on you"

April,"1,692",Elsa Kopf,"As I awoke I found out he had gone
For no reason at all
First came the rose
And then the thorn
And now he's gone
April was blooming all around
All I saw is he had gone
April has seen our rise and fall
And now he's gone
Pity me
when the evening shadows fall
Forgive me for what I've done
For I've kept the taste
of a love that's gone
The rose and the thorn
April was blooming all around
All I saw is he had gone
April has seen our rise and fall
And now he's gone
Oh he is gone in the wind blow my hair
with thorn in my heart
I will learn to go on
He is gone in the wind bite my cheeks
with thorn in my heart
I will learn to go on"

From looking at your

Just a week ago
you were my baby
Now I don't even

I don't know you at all
Well I wish that you

cos you're on my head
Regrets and mistakes

Back to the old days
when we knew what lay ahead
And I was wondering

but I'm so out of line
I'll just get declined
Cos you're happier this time

we could be much better
If you disagree then

Don't Forget to Wave,573,Josh Wolfsohn,"The flickering TV
Our days are sloped and steep
But we get by
Climbing up like soldiers
Our phone calls late at night
They glow like candle light
They’re warm like double duvets
on our shoulders
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t forget to wave
Your tracks in snow As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t forget to wave to me
We steamed the windows up
Let iron patience rust
We’re gonna have
to throw ourselves outside
And when the blizzard comes
Let our feet go numb
We’ll be treading lightly
for a long time
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t forget to wave
Your tracks in snow As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t forget to wave to me
The snapshots fizzle out
Two was such a crowd
I bet your voice is different
since I saw you Though
the ice melts grey
Summer’s on its way
I’m brave enough to crawl out
from my igloo
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t forget to wave
Your tracks in snow
As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t forget to wave to me
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t forget to wave
Your tracks in snow
As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t forget to wave to me"

There's a gold dirt road

This is God's country
We pray for rain
and thank it when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain
and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it

If I Really Love You,698,Lexi Jayde,"Yesterday you told me
that you wanna be alone
I could hear the distance
in your voice over the phone
You don't say I love you back
Or let your feelings show
You used to be so good at that
But now I never know
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me
how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Midnight drives in your old
sweatshirts never felt so cold
And I still hear the stupid
songs you showed me
everywhere I go
I can taste the hesitation
running from your lips
I can feel it in my bones
they're breaking
We can't end like this
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me
how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Moments wrapped and romance
That end with bitter sunrises
and goodbyes
Moments so fragile and rare
That I wonder
if it would have the same taste
If not such a delicacy
But I'd still devour you
As I lay here and recall years
of wavering emotions
Suppressed desires
and volcanic explosions
That retreat into dormancy
I wonder could
we ever flow together
Or are we two twin souls
Finding each other
in the wrong lifetime
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
If I really love you
I'll let you go"
I Knew I Loved You,148,Music Travel Love,"Hmm yeah yeah yeah

More than a little crazy
but I believe
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
There's just no rhyme or reason
Only the sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home
I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy

I knew I loved you
before I met you

And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation
with the little white lies
And the faded picture
of a beautiful night
You carried me
from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying
was she worth this mess
After everything
and that little black dress
After everything I must confess
I need you"
The Way I Loved You (Taylor’s Version),413,Taylor Swift,"He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything
I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight.""
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming
and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming
and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming
and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way
I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you"
Washing Machine,135,Kings Of Convenience,"I lost count how many times I've tumbled round inside your washing machine
Hung myself out to dry, to regain some of my self-esteem

Are you just a spoiled girl who's never had to make up her mind?
Am I just a fool to think that you could ever be mine?

Go and find somebody else (go and find somebody else)
Go and find somebody else (go and find somebody else)

It's true I'm more wise now than I was when I was twenty-one
It's true I've less time now than I had when I was twenty-one

I feel so vulnerable when you are not around
You have so much power over me

Go and find somebody else (go and find somebody else)
Go and find somebody else (go and find somebody else)"

My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something’s got a hold on me that won’t let go
I never thought it could happen to me
Got me heavy without the misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love’s sure gonna put a hurting on me

only my features
My boy behind me
he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls
onto the beaches
Come one come all
I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus
Forget all of thе tears
that you've cried
It's ovеr (Over over over over)
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming my baby
Acid green aquamarine
The girls are dancing in the sand
And I throw my cellular device
in the water
Can you reach me No you can't (Aha)
My cheeks in high colour
overripe peaches
No shirt no shoes
only my features
My boy behind me
he's taking pictures
(He's taking pictures)
Lead the boys and girls
onto the beaches
Come one come all
I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus
Turn it on in a new kind of bright
It's solar (Solar solar solar solar)
Come on and let the bliss begin
Blink three times
when you feel it kicking in
That solar olar olar power
Solar olar olar power
Solar olar olar power
Solar olar olar power
Solar olar olar power
Solar olar olar power"
Only Us (From The “Dear Evan Hansen” Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),543,Kaitlyn Dever,"I don't need you to sell me
on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search
for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared
you're not enough
'Cause what
we've got going is good
I don't need more reminders
of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix
what I'd rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noise
that's in your head
We can't compete with all that
So what if it's us
what if it's us
And only us
And what came before
won't count anymore
or matter
Can we try that
What if it's you
what if it's me
what if that's all
that we needed to bе
And the rest
of the world fliеs away
What do you say
I ain't never thought
there'll be someone
like you who would want me
So I'll give you ten thousand
reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me
and nothing else
Well that's all
that I've wanted for longer
than you could possibly know
So it can be us it can be us
And only us
And what came before
won't count anymore
or matter
We can try that
It's not so impossible
Nobody else but the two of us here
'Cause you're saying it's possible
We can just watch
the whole world disappear
'Til you're the only one
I still know how to see
It's just you and me
It'll be us
it'll be us and only us
And what came before
won't count anymore
We can try that you and me
That's all that we needed to be
And the rest
of the world falls away
And the rest
of the world falls away
ayy ayy ayy
The world falls away
the world falls away
the world falls away
the world falls away
And it's only us"

Always Gonna Be,51,Dan + Shay,"Paradise is a swing on a porch
Summertime is a little too short
The best things in life are free
And they're always gonna be
Hometown is a heaven on earth
Sundays are for football and church
The world turns but I believe
There's always gonna be

Beer drinkin' kids on a backroad
Good country songs on the radio
Tailgates fallin' down on a Friday
Long goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long as the sun keeps comin' up
Long as the Mississippi River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some things are always gonna be

Girl, your eyes are my favorite blue
I double-take when I wake up with you
I'm so in love with you lovin' on me
And I'm always gonna be
Holding you close for the rest of my life

Always gonna hold your hand
Always gonna ask you to dance
Even when we're pushin' eighty
You're still gonna drive me crazy

Spotlight,0,Tilsen,"In my head
Thoughts they weigh like lead
I can see the end
Don’t pretend to comprehend this
Bright whirlwind lights and white tour vans
Balance on the edge of the borderline

I would let you in but I know

You’ll never understand so why even try
You’re wishing that your life would be like mine
I keep on moving up while you fall behind
In the shadow of the spotlight

In every song
My words on your tongue
Everything I’ve done to throw you a lifeline
You’re where I was before the big tour bus
Miles from the ledge of the borderline

I would let you in but I know

You’ll never understand so why even try
You’re wishing that your life would be like mine
I keep on moving up while you fall behind
In the shadow of the spotlight

When you’re next to me all I see are empty spaces
It’s a one way street but you don’t even sing my praises

You’ll never understand so why even try
You’re wishing that your life would be like mine
I keep on moving up while you fall behind
In the shadow of the spotlight
In the shadow of the spotlight
In the shadow of the spotlight
In the shadow of the spotlight
You’ll never understand so why even try"

I Almost Do,587,Taylor Swift,"I bet this time of night
you’re still up
I bet you’re tired
from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair
by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes
you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
I bet you think
I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out
there’s no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
Oh we made quite a mess babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess babe
In my dreams
you’re touching my face
And asking me
if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
I bet this time of night
you’re still up

I bet you’re sitting in your chair

Looking out at the city

you wonder about me"
The Box,"3,526",Damien Rice,"Don't give me
something to hold in my hand
Something else to believe in
Cause I'm over it
And your reasons for wanting to stay
Your reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything are dull to you
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box I'm living with
I could go wild
but you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
but god forbid then you might envy me
So don't give me
love with an old book of rules
That kind of love's just for fools
And I'm over it
My reasons for walking away
My reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything are lost with you
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box I'm living with
I could go wild
but you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
but god forbid then you might envy me
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box you call a gift
I could go wild

When I could be wild and free

I could be wild and free
Well god forbid then you might"
Nothing But Mine,65,Billie Marten,"Rest your head
Over mine
I have faith in our love
Wash my mouth
Empty out
All the dirt that you found
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you
Dust me off
Fix me up
I don't want
What I was
And lock it up
Keep it there
It's no good
And nowhere
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you
And don't you take
my heart and break it
Be my friend
There is no other way to say it
'Cause you got me again
Don't you take
my heart and break it
Be my friend
There is no other way to say it
'Cause you got me again
'Cause you got me again
Rest your head
Over mine
I have faith in our love"
Morning Has Broken,164,Cat Stevens,"Morning has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken
Like the first spring
Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the world

Sweet the rains new fall
Sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall
On the first grass
Preaise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where his feet pass

Mine is the sunlight
Mine is the morning
Born of the one light
Eden saw play
Praise with elation
Praise every morning
God's recreation
of the new day

Morning has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken
Like the first spring
Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the world"
Take This Waltz,318,Leonard Cohen,"Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallways where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz it's been dying for years
There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ...
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, Oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now. It's all that there is"
Gone The Rainbow,298,"Peter, Paul & Mary","Shule, shule, shule-a-roo,
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo.
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal,
come bibble in the boo shy Lorey.
Here I sit on Buttermilk Hill;
who could blame me, cry my fill;
Every tear would turn a mill,
Johnny's gone for a soldier.
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo,
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo.
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal,

I sold my flax, I sold my wheel,
to buy my love a sword of steel;
So it in battle he might wield,
Johnny's gone for a soldier.

Oh my baby, oh, my love,
gone the rainbow, gone the dove.

Lemon Tree,367,"Peter, Paul & Mary","When I was just a lad of ten,
my father said to me,
""Come here and take a lesson
from the lovely lemon tree.""

Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.

Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.

One day, beneath the lemon tree,
my love and I did lie,
A girl so sweet, that when she smiled,
the stars rose in the sky.

We passed that summer lost in love
beneath the lemon tree,
The music of her laughter
hid my father's words from me.

Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.

Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.

One day she left without a word,
she took away the sun.
And in the dark she'd left behind,
I knew what she had done.

She'd left me for another,
it's a common tale but true.
A sadder man, but wiser now,
I sing these words to you

Lemon tree Lemon tree

Try To Remember,113,The Brothers Four,"Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow

Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green And grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender And callow fellow

Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow

Try to remember When life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow

Try to remember the kind of September
When love was an ember About to billow

Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow, follow

Deep in December It's nice to remember
Although you know The snow will follow

Deep in December It's nice to remember
Without the hurt the heart is hollow

Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September That made us mellow

Deep in December Our hearts should remember
then follow, follow, follow -"
I'd Rather Be With You,"1,504",Joshua Radin,"Sitting here on this lonely dock
Watch the rain play
on the ocean top
All the things I feel
I need to say
I can't explain in any other way
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older
with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
Now here's the sun
come to dry the rain
Warm my shoulders and
relieve my pain
You're the one thing
that I'm missing here
With you beside me
I no longer fear
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older
with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
I could have saved
so much time for us
Had I seen the way to
get to where I am today
You waited on me for so long
So now listen to me say
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older
with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
Say you feel the way I do"
Love Story,"1,064",Taylor Swift,"We were both young
when I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony of summer air
See the lights See the party
the ball gowns I see you make
your way through the crowd
You say hello Little did I know
That you were Romeo
you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away
from Juliet And I was crying
on the staircase Begging you
please don't go and i said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
So I sneak out to the garden to
see you We keep quiet cause
we're dead if they know
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away
from Juliet But you were
everything to me I was begging you
please don't go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me they try to tell me
how to feel This love is difficult
but it's real Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were
ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts
of town I said Romeo save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you
but you never come
Is this in my head
i don't know what to think
He knealt to the ground
and pulled out a ring And said
Marry me Juliet you'll never
have to be alone I love you
and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go
pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes

Cause we were both young
when I first saw you"
What He Wrote,621,Laura Marling,"Forgive me Hera
I cannot stay.
He cut out my tongue,
there is nothing to say.
Love me oh Lord, he threw me away,
he laughed at my sins,
in his arms i must stay.
He wrote, I'm broke.
Please send for me.
But I'm broken too, and spoken for.
Do not, tempt me.
Her skin is white,
and I'm light as the sun,
so holy light shines,
on the things, you have done.
So I asked him,
how he became this man?
How that he learned,
to hold fruit in his hands?
and where is the lamb,
that gave you your name?
He had to leave,
though i begged HIM to stay.
Left me alone, when i needed the light
Fell to me knees and i wept for my life
If he had of stayed,
you might understand.
If he had of stayed,
you never would've taken my hand.
He wrote I'm low.
Please send for me.
but I'm broken too, and spoken for.
Do not, tempt me.
and where is the lamb,
that gave you your name?
He had to flee,
though I begged him to stay.
Begged him to stay,
in my cold wooden grip.
Begged him to stay,
by the light of my ship.
Me fighting him, fighting light,
fighting dawn.
The waves came, and stole him,
and took him toward.
He wrote, I'm broke.
Please send for me.
but I'm broken too, and spoken for.
Do not, tempt me.
Forgive me Hera, I cannot stay.
He cut out my tongue,
there is nothing to say
Love me oh lord, he threw me away.
He laughed at my sins,
in his arms i must stay.
We write.
That's alright.
I miss his smell.
We speak when spoken to.
That suits us well that suits us well.
That suits me well"
Paper Aeroplane,"1,077",Angus & Julia Stone,"I spilled the ink
across the page trying
to spell your name
So I fold it up and I flick it out
Paper aeroplane
It wont fly the seven seas to you
Cause it didn't leave my room
But it awaits the hands
of someone else
The garbage man
Got to say mm mm mm
Got to say mm mm mm
So he opens it up
and reads it out to all his
friends
Amongst the crowd a heart will
break and a heart will mend
He walks on home tired from work
The letter falls from his hand
He reaches out only
to catch the sky
Its gone with the wind
Got to say mm mm mm
Got to say mm mm mm
I spilled the ink across the land
Trying to spell your name
Up and down there it goes
Paper aeroplane
It hasn't flown
the seven seas to you
But its on its way
It goes through the hands
Then to someone else
To find you girl
Got to say mm
Got to say mm"
Mine (POP Mix),"2,120",Taylor Swift,"You were in college workin'
part time waitin' tables
Left a small town
never looked back
I was a flight risk
with a fear of fallin'
Wonderin' why we bother
with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
You remember
we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin'
on the world together
And there's a drawer of my
things at your place
You learn my secrets and
you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make
my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is
what I thought about
You remember we were
sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city
lights on the water
You saw me start to believe
for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight
2 30 am
You said Everything was
slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you
followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone
You said
I remember how we felt
sittin' by the water
And everytime I look at you
it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless
man's careful daughter
She is the best thing
that's ever been mine
Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine
do you believe it
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now"
The Sun The Trees (Acoustic Ver.),924,Russian Red,"Send The Sun The Trees Ringtone to your Cell
The sun fills the kitchen in my house
it's warm and cosy and it helps me breathe
and I wonder if you're making people laugh
'cause you're funny you're funny
The trees out of my window dance
oh they do dance with the wind
and I wonder why I wonder why
I wonder why we are apart
'Cause we're funny people beautiful inside
The sun the trees the moon the sea
the clouds above hang over me
The sun the trees the moon the sea
The sea goes quiet when the night is dark
with the lights reflected jump in from the sky
and I wonder if we'll see the moon walk by
'cause it's shinning it's shinning
as it lights the sadows see the moon walk by
The sun the trees the moon the sea
the clouds above hang over me
The sun the trees the moon the sea
The sun the trees the moon the sea"

Bridge Over Troubled Water,"1,263",Paul Simon,"When you're weary
feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh when times get rough
And friend just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down
Sail on silver girl
sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll ease your mind"

I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go anywhere

Everyday the weekend
I'm tryna be your best friend
Trying just to figure it out
Go on and let your gun burst
Living on the outskirts
Trying just to figure it out
Talking like a deadbeat
I just wanted you to see
Everything that I could see
Walking in the night sky
I'm always on your side
You are really saving me

And dance in the hotel room
We can go to the Chateau Marmont

Glittery (From The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show) (Feat. Troye Sivan),"1,195",Kacey Musgraves,"You shake me up
and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight
on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
Outside it's coming down
But here inside it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight
on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
The winter is so gray
feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me
you know you melt it all away
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
Oh so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart"

I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church

I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's

It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like
you don't want me to

It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh you're breakin' my heart
Baby you're playin' hard to forget
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch on the swing
You'll come and grab 'em
by the end of the week
Well it's just some
jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been
dragging your feet

Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,360,Sam Hunt,"Yeah man oh man oh man
Bartender looked at me like
Pony up man
we're closin' down
I paid the tab
and I turned around
Got on that phone
on the way home
And ended up
down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you
haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see
New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey what you gon' do
I'm sick of sittin' at the house
dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere
I can be alone
Try to let you go
somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk
tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures
I don't wanna see
Girl you're everywhere
everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up
was easy in the '90s
Back then
I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called
when I was out
But you didn't know what to say
so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably
at home right now
sound asleep
'Cause goin' out
isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue
what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls
I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again
I'm sick of sittin' at the house
dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere
I can be alone
Try to let you go
somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up
was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk
tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures
I don't wanna see
Girl you're everywhere
everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Modern love
it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of
my generation and I
'Bout had enough
watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby I'm sick of sittin' at the house
dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere
I can be alone
I try to let you go
somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up
was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk
tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures

Tap Twice,113,Katy Kirby,"Gracious and severe
and lying next to me
When I don't know
if you're sleeping,
but you oughta be
I just wanted to protect you,
with your shaking
hands and no shoes
I just thought that
you might grow to understand
I tap twice on your doorframe
and you let me in
I tap twice on your forehead
and a heart appears
It seems like you're only high
when you're holding your breath
Only bright
when you're broken in half
When we met a few years back,
you didn't warm to me
And I left oranges in your bedroom
like an offering
And I see you in the future,
you look just the same, but older
And I wave to you,
but I don't slow my pace
I tap twice on your doorframe
and you let me in
I tap twice on your forehead
and a heart appears
It seems like you're only high
when you're holding your breath
Only bright
when you're broken in half
And I almost broke my wrists
trying to bring you back
And you thrashed around
like goldfish in a garbage bag
It seems like you're only high
when you're holding your breath
Only bright
when you're broken in half"
The Missing Road,267,Radical Face,"Time
Ticking in the back of my mind
'Cause I know what I'll find
If I sit in place
So I walk
Never really sure where I'm going
But it's better than knowing
What everyday will be
I am who I am
And I know what I know
But I don't know my way
I just go where I go
But I never could forget your face
It finds me in my sleep
And I'd like to tell you
about those dreams
But talk is always cheap
So I go where I go
That road is gone
Now it just lives in this song
I've seen all I've seen
But I sometimes wonder
If you still think of me
I never meant to fade away
It's just the way I'm made
I hope if you ever hear my name
That it doesn't bring you pain
And just know that I know
Yeah just know that I know
That those days were gold
And a heart always holds
Onto missing roads"
One Too Many,580,Keith Urban,"I don’t remember much
about last night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living room
through these bloodshot
eyes of my mine
cold sober
You didn’t like
that I come home late
4am but it’s a Friday babe
And I’ve been working hard
Can’t you give me some space
steada shoutin out
Oh my God
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me
miss you more
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat here
Staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing
Where did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve had one too many
Come take me home
Now I’m the one that’s crying
I didn’t wanna call
cos I didn’t wanna fight
I swear that I was trying
But everybody falls
when their head’s a little high
And I never meant to get
so out my mind
With you playing cool
just pretending it’s fine
Oh we’ve been
‘round ‘round ‘round this
Too many times before
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me
miss you more more
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat here
Staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing
Where did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve had one too many
Come take me home
I don’t know how lucky
how lucky I am I am I am no
I guess sometimes
I should give more
of a damn a damn a damn
about you
I don’t know how lucky
how lucky I am I am I am no
I know we’re both stubborn
Push each other’s buttons
I’d rather do it with you but
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat here
Staring at my phone
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat here
Staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing
Where did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve had one too many
Come take me home
Come take me home

'Cause I know it by heart, yeah
We can't even say, No, let alone let go
'Cause we'd end up where we are
And I know I said I wouldn't
And you know said you wouldn't too
So how'd we end up here, in the same room

Chorus
It's irresponsible
To be this close after midnight
Irresponsible
To remind myself what your lips taste like
'Cause I'm still gettin' over the last time, we said it's the last time
But I still, I still
Pick up when you call
Even though it's irresponsible

Verse 2
I wish I had a good excuse but no matter what I do
I can't even think of one
Yeah, I know history repeats, I'll be right back in your sheets
When it's all said and done
It's against our better judgement, I know
Even though we both want it, it's so, it's so

Hold Her While You Can,145,Stephen Sanchez,"She’s a flower among the weeds,
more beautiful than any rose
I put the creases in her shoes,
she put the crinkle in my nose
I’ll have wrinkles when I’m young,
from all the laughing I suppose
And I’ll hold your heart forever,
long after I propose

Hold her while you can,
cause someday you won’t get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you’ve spent
Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won’t end
So, I’ll hold her while I can, till the one day that I get the chance again

She’s a doll at 83, acting like we both just met
Reminding me of times,
that I swore I’d not forget
Now I’m 85 years old, alone,
lying on this bed
Missing the sound of her voice and the three words that she once said

Hold her while you can, cause someday you won’t get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you’ve spent
Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won’t end
So, I’ll hold her while I can, till the one day that I get the chance

Hold her while you can, cause someday you won’t get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you’ve spent
Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won’t end
So, I’ll hold her while I can, till the one day that I get the chance"

Neptune,45,Handsome Ghost,"You said isn't that better rising up from my sink
Hair down to your shoulders show me bright blue streaks
One and then another and some blue on the ground
Well, all of this color and it's so dark out

In the world
May we hold on to the pretty stuff
Showed me your tattoo of Neptune
And told me that nowhere's ever far enough

Then I was driving you home
I was driving you home

Dead of that winter in my brother's car
Heavy snow settled took us twice as long
Smoked out the window then you drew me a map
Said this is us here now look at all of that

You were reaching
No this can't be all we ever are
Maybe we try California
Maybe we marry us some movie stars

Then I was driving you home
I was driving home

Found you much later you were in it deep
Dive down on the corner where you drank for free
Wrapped your tiny fingers round a microphone
Oh, and you were singing you were no, no nobody's woman

I knew a couple boys who thought you were
Said you're just trying to teach them
But look how they never learn
They never learn they never learn

I was driving you home
I was driving you home"

Everything That Rises,37,Sufjan Stevens,"Can you lift me up to a higher place?
Forget everything that was before
Turn your face around
Like the salted sphere
Turn yourself around
To see what once was there

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises...

Jesus lift me up to a higher plane
Can you come around before I go insane?
Cast me not in hell
Where the demons rage
Turn yourself around
To see what I can save

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises....

Turn yourself away
From the wickedness, I said
Evil comes to play
In the image of the dead

Everything rises, must converge
Everything rises in a word
Everything rises, must converge
Everything rises...."

Trust Me Mate (Slowed + Reverb),39,Dean Lewis,"You're pulling out your cigarette
You bring it up towards your lips
You breathe and push the smoke away
just like you do with all your friends
Your room is messy and full of clothes
The curtains drawn, the windows closed
When did the person that I love turn into someone I don't know?


'Cause there's a light gone from your eyes
Like the whole world's not as bright until you find another high
There's so much pain inside your voice
And you try to drown it out with anything to fill the void


But, trust me, mate, you've got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promisе that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
Wе almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
I'm not giving up on you


I say it's time we have the talk
Make a move towards the door
And you deny there's anything you've got to hide or answer for
You say, ""I don't want you in my place""
""Just get the fuck out of my face""
But I won't give up so easy 'cause I know you'd do the same

So, trust me, mate, you've got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promise that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
We almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse


And, if it gets worse
Before it gets better
Don't be afraid to fall
'Cause I won't let ya
If it gets worse
Before it gets better
Don't be afraid to fall

So, trust me, mate, you've got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promise that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
We almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
I'm not giving up on you

I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you

In a place where no one knows what we have done

Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Well you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands
And my foot in the appropriate place

And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands
In the mild issue of our disgrace

Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum

Well I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has accidental babies
For we are in love

Do you come
Together ever with him?
Is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?

What about me?
What about me?"
Cheers Darlin',769,Damien Rice,"Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover boy
Cheers darlin'
I got years to wait around
for you
Cheers darlin'
I've got your wedding bells
in my ear
Cheers darlin'
You give me three cigarettes to
smoke my tears away
And I die when you mention
his name
And I lied I should have
kissed you
When we were running in the rain
What am I darlin'
A whisper in your ear
A piece of your cake

The boy you can fear
Or your biggest mistake

Here's to you and your

I got a ribbon of green
on my guitar

I got a beauty queen
To sit not very far from me
I die when he comes around
To take you home
I'm too shy
I should have kissed you
when we were alone
What am I darlin'
A whisper in your ear
A piece of your cake
What am i darlin
The boy you can fear
Or your biggest mistake
Oh what am I

What am i darlin'
I got years to wait"
The Messiah Will Come Again,194,Roy Buchanan,"Just a smile, just a glance
The Prince of Darkness
He just walked past
There's been a lot of people
And they've had a lot to say
But this time, I'm gonna tell it my way

There was a town
There was a strange little town, they called The World
It was a lonely, lonely little town
'Til one day a stranger appeared
And their hearts rejoiced
And the sad little town was happy again
But there was some that doubted
They disbelieved so they mocked him
And that stranger, he went away
Now the sad little town that was sad yesterday
It's a lot sadder today

I walked in a lot of places I never should have been
But I know that the Messiah, he will come again"

Marry You,346,Eric Clapton,"It's the sugar so sweet
The kind I like to eat
You and me

Tell no one else about it
I'm gonna make you mine
Cause I know we've got the time
Now and then baby
Hey I want you to know
I wanna marry you
Isn't that what you want too
I wanna marry you
Isn't that what you want too

Come on in the back of my 57
Let me show you the way
Way to heaven
You're looking so sweet

Still Got The Blues,"1,189",Gary Moore,"Use to be so easy
To give my heart away
But I found that the hard way
was the price you have to pay
I found that that love
is no friend of mine
I should have
know'n time after time
So long
it was so long ago
But I've still
got the blues for you
Use to be so easy
Fall in love again
But I found that the hard way
It's a roll that leeds to pain
I found now that love
is more than just a game
Play and to win
but you loose just the same
So long
it was so long ago
But I've
still got the blues for you
So many years
since I seal you face
You will my heart
there's an empty space
Used to be

So long
it was so long ago
But I've
still got the blues for you
Golden days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you"
One More Cup of Coffee,291,Bob Dylan,"Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two
jewels in the sky
Your back is straight
Your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One more cup of coffee fore I go
One more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below

Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to
pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles
as he calls out
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below

Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to
read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below"
Famous Blue Raincoat,472,Leonard Cohen,"It's four in the morning
the end of December
I'm writing you now
just to see if you're better
New York is cold
but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street
all through the evening
I hear that you're building
your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now
I hope you're keeping
some kind of record
Yes and Jane came by
with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you
planned to go clear

Did you ever go clear
Ah the last time we saw you
you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat
as torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station
to meet every train
And you came home
without Lili Marlene
And you treated my woman
to a flake of your life
And when she came back
she was nobody's wife
Well I see you there
with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane's awake

She sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother
my killer
What can I possibly say
I guess that I miss you
I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way
If you ever come by here
for Jane or for me
Your enemy is sleeping
and his woman is free
Yes and thanks
for the trouble you took
from her eyes
I thought it was there
for good so I never tried

And Jane came by with a
lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you
planned to go clear"
Cocoon,"1,218",Jack Johnson,"Well based on your smile
I'm betting all of this
Might be over soon
But your bound to win
Cause if I'm betting against you
I think I'd rather lose
But this is all that I have
So please
Take what's left of this heart and use
Please use only what you really need
You know I only have so little
So please
Mend your broken heart and leave
I know it's not your style
I can tell by the way that you move
It's real real soon
But I'm on your side
And I don't want to be your regret
I'd rather be your cocoon
But this is all that you have
So please
Let me take what's left of
your heart and I will use
I swear I'll use only what I need
I know you only have so little
So please
Let me mend my broken heart and
You said this was all you had
And it's all I need
But blah blah blah
Because it fell apart and
I guess it's all you knew
And all I have
But now we have
Only confused hearts and
I guess all we have
Is really all we need
So please
Let's take these broken hearts and use
Let's use only what we really need
You know we only have so little
So please
Take these broken hearts and leave"
The Best Day,865,Taylor Swift,"I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got a big coat on
I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
And run and run
At the pumpkin patch
The tractor rolls on
The sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
The whole way home
I don't know why all
the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared
of anything at all
Don't know if Snow
White's house is near or far away
But I know that I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean I come home crying
and You hold me tight
And grab the keys
And you drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away And we talk
and window shop Until I've
forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm gonna
talk to Now at school
I know I'm laughing on
the car ride home with you
Don't know how long
it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than nothing
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint
set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the edge of princesses
and pirate ships And the
seven dwarves Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady
in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees
change in the fall
And you were on my side
Even when I was wrong And I
love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today"
I Am Me Once More (Album Version),"1,580",Zee Avi,"No, I really don't think so

That you think I'd be incapable of being on my own

No, I really don't think so

That I would for a second let you back in through my door



I have spent many a nights

Even when you are by my side

I shed tears I couldn't dry

I shed tears I couldn't dry



But I should thank you for

Taking my blindfold off now

I ain't jaded no more, no more

And I take pride in being the one that said goodbye

That could only mean I am me, once more



You would turn your head the other way

So you won't have to listen to what I have to say

You assume that I needed you

But you didn't realize that I needed no one but myself

I needed no one but myself



But I should thank you for

Taking my blindfold off now

I ain't jaded no more, no more

And I take pride in being the one that said goodbye

That could only mean I am me, once more



That could only mean I am me, once more

That could only mean I am me, once more"
Jump Then Fall,"1,130",Taylor Swift,"I like the way you sound
in the morning we're on the phone
and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best
sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my
focus I watch you talk

Dear John,942,Taylor Swift,"Long were the nights
When the days once
revolved around you

Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor
won't fall through again
My mother accused me of
losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
and go back
And turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules
every day

Wonderin which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to
let you know why
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away
And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret
How I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
Dear John
I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's
too young
To be played by your dark
twisted games
When I loved you so
I shoulda known

You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
And never impressed by me
Acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
Cuz you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with the girl
in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song
You should've known
You shoulda known

Don't you think I was too young
You shoulda known"
Last Kiss,897,Taylor Swift,"I still remember the look
on your face
Been through the darkness
at 1 58
The words that you whispered for
just us to know
You told me you loved me so
why did you go away

go away

I do recall now the smell
of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th the beat
of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
Never thought
we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined
we'd end like this
Your name forever the name
on my lips
I do remember the swing
of your step
The life of the party
you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and
then you pulled me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did because
I loved your handshake
meeting my father
I love how you walk with your
hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me
when I was in the middle of
saying something
There's not a day
I don't miss those rude
interruptions and
I'll go sit on the floor wearing
your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
how to be something you miss
Never thought
we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined
we'd end like this
Your name forever the name
on my lips

So I'll watch your life
in pictures like I used to
watch you sleep and
I'll feel you forget me
like I use to feel you
breathe and
I'll keep up with our old friends
just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
and I hope the sun shines and
it's a beautiful day and
Something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
we can plan for a change in
weather and time
I never planned on you
changing your mind
So
I'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
how to be something you miss
Never thought
we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined
we'd end like this
Your name forever the name
on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips

Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last"

Starting New,556,Louis Yoelin,"Warm breath is all it takes
To feel the rush a little break
From how you thought it'd be
I'm not the type to boast
I just need to make the most
Of this reality
If every little thing
doesn't work out
like you planned
Remember every little footstep
doesn't have to land
And every little dream
that you have may not come true
But today we're starting new
we're starting new
One life is all you have
So be good
be good to yourself
Don't shy away
If every little thing
doesn't work out
like you planned
Remember every little footstep
doesn't have to land
And every little dream
that you have may not come true
But today we're starting new
I don't want to live like this
Regretting all the
things I missed
And finally the feet I've got
Are gonna dance yah
If every little thing
doesn't work out

Remember every little footstep

And every little dream
that you have may not come true
But today we're starting new
Oh we're starting new

Queen Of Hearts,168,Juice Newton,"Midnight, and I'm a waiting on the twelve oh five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line

Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done

Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one

And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts"

'Come a Little Bit Closer (From 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2')',112,Graham Blvd,"In a little café just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there givin' me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man, José
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say, yeah

Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long

So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
That I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
""Vamoose, José's on his way""
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah

Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long

Then the music stopped
When I looked the café was empty
Then I heard José say
""Man you know you're in trouble plenty""
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to José, yeah

Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long

You Can Do Better Than Me But I Hope You Don't,293,Daudi Matsiko,"I'd like to become the man that
I am supposed to be
But I'm a rotten tooth in
A mouth full of crooked teeth
Now doing the right thing ain't easy
It doesn't come naturally
And now you can barely look at me
And I can barely speak
And love we used to know
Where to find it
These feelings they don't go
And I can't hide it
Do you still want me
You can't look at me
I should say I'm sorry
But my throat won't let me speak
I've been hiding all my flaws
But you saw the truth on my face
And now that
it's all come crashing down
You've handled it with so much grace
So now you know all my secrets
And yet you still talk to me
Your love was the atomic bomb
And my heart was Nagasaki
And love I used to know
Who the hell I was
Now I can't shake your shadow
I can't escape your ghost
Do you still want me
You can't look at me
I should say I'm sorry
But my throat won't let me speak
Do you still want me
I can hardly breath
I should say I'm sorry
You can do better than me"

Saturday Sun,303,Vance Joy,"[Chorus]
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost

[Verse 1]
So tired of sleepin' alone
So tired of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?
She felt like resting her head
My shoulder was the perfect height
We fit so right, so what's goin' on?
'Cause I've been undone
The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've been undone

[Chorus]
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

She put the breeze in my hair
No kiss was softer, softer than this
I'm readin' her lips, oh
Each line I read
She left her books in my bed
And her song in my head
I've been undone

[Chorus]
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost

Oh, Saturday Sun

The Good Ones,423,Gabby Barrett,"He's a phone call to his parents
He's a bible by the bed
He's the t shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from
One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find
when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
You'll know him
when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find
when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
We should all find us one
They're out there minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah I got a good one
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find
when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones"

Far Side of the World,47,Holden Miller,"I fell in love with a girl on the far side of the world
If I could fold the globe, our love would be more than just heard
And I feel her smile as she talks
But it's not the same from an ocean away
I fell in love with a girl on the far side of the world

[Chorus]
If I shut my eyes, will you appear?
'Cause I'm not me without you here
And is it fair to let you know
That I'm afraid to let you go?

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with a girl on the dark side of the moon
But when she steps out into the light, she's gone too soon
And as she shines and wanes
I watch her wave from the milky way
I fell in love with a girl on the dark side of the moon

[Chorus]
If I shut my eyes, will you appear?
'Cause I'm not me without you here
And is it fair to let you know
That I'm afraid to let you go?

[Post-Chorus]
If I shut my eyes, will you appear?
'Cause I can't be without you here
If I'm a fool, then let me know
And I'll make peace with the unknown

[Outro]
I fell in love with a girl who lives inside my mind
And I go searching but she's right behind my eyes
And when she steps in frame, I reach out but she fades away
I fell in love with a girl who I may never find"

"Going, Going, Gone",57,Luke Combs,"Verse 1
Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leavin'
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go

Chorus
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

Verse 2
I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind

Chorus
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on

One Thing At A Time,56,Morgan Wallen,"Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been getting better by the day but tonight I drink
You say I gotta get over you
And get sober too
I got a lotta habits I gotta kick
Well, weigh out all your options
And take your pick
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell ya, girl
But I'm only quitting one thing at a time
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forget
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all the help I can get
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey
Some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop loving you
Hey, what you want me to do?
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell ya, girl
But I'm only quitting one thing at a time
Ah, yeah, I hate to tell you
Ah, yeah, I hate to tell you
I ain't no superman
I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on
Then I need me something in my hand
Ain't nothing wrong with that
And if you ain't coming back
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby, off my mind

If You're Hurting,42,Trousdale,"Have you ever been afraid
Of something you don't have?
Been scared to start
'Cause you don't know the end yet?
Like the cards in your hands
But you don't wanna play
Or the words in your head
That you don't wanna say out loud
You don't wanna get shut down

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie awake in bed catching your breath
If you need to cry but you've been holding back

[Chorus]
If you're hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There is a light at the end of this tunnel
If you're hurting
It means you're here

[Verse 2]
It means you're one step closer
And two steps left behind
With your back to the mirror
'Cause you don't know what you'll find yet
To the ones in your heart that'll never leave
To the ones in the crowd that just wanna be seen
You can lie in bed and catch your breath
It's okay to cry
The tears won't hold you back

[Chorus]
If you're hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There is a light at the end of this tunnel
If you're hurting
It means you're here

[Bridge]
If you're fighting (If you're fighting)
If you're broken (If you're broken)
It means you're human (It means you're human)
You're one of us (You're one of us)
If you're bleeding (If you're bleeding)
If you're healing (If you're healing)
It means you're human (It means you're human)
You're one of us

[Chorus]
If you're hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There is a light at the end of this tunnel
Give yourself a little time to feel
If you're hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There is a light at the end of this tunnel
If you're hurting
It means you're here
I'm glad you're here"

from across the room
'Bout time I got my nerve
Well you might tell me ""Boy hell naw""
But hell what can it hurt?
'Cause I just wanna
Spin you around,
and around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's,
and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind

my heart without a sign
Girl, it oughta be a crime
Got a pretty good feelin'
I'm takin' you home
Gonna love you with all I got
But before we slip out into the night
I just want one more shot
To take your hand and
Spin you around,
and round this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's,
and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole
my heart without a sign
Girl, it oughta be a crime
I fought in some bars,
broken some hearts
Ain't ever done nothin' this bad
Yeah, with one look at me
you became my disease
They don't make no cure for that
And I just wanna
Spin you around,
and round this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's,
and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart

Deeper Well,13,Kacey Musgraves,"My Saturn has returned
When I turned twenty-seven, everything started to change
Took a long time, but I learned
There's two kinds of people
One is a giver, and one's always trying to take
All they can take

So, I'm saying goodbye
To the people that I feel are real good at wasting my time
No regrets, baby
I just think that maybe
You go your way, and I'll go mine
It's been a real good time
But you've got dark energy
Something I can't unsee
And I've got to take care of myself
I've found a deeper well

I used to wake and bake
Roll out of bed, hit the gravity bong that I made
And start the day
For a while, it got me by
Everything I did seemed better when I was high
I don't know why

So, I'm getting rid of the habits
That I feel are real good at wasting my time
No regrets, baby
I just think that maybe
It's natural when things lose their shine
So other things can glow
I've gotten older, now I know
How to take care of myself
I've found a deeper well
Hmm, mmm

When I was growing up
We had what we needed
Shoes on our feet
But the world was as flat as a plate
And that's okay
The things I was taught only took me so far
Had to figure the rest out myself
And then I found
I found a deeper well
Hmm, mmm
Hmm"
Red,530,Taylor Swift,"Loving him is like
driving a new Maserati
down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind
passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
trying to change your mind
once you're already flying
through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright
just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey
all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing
all you ever wanted was right
there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
trying to solve a crossword and
realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey
all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red
Remembering him comes
in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now
gotta let go
But moving on
from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red
Oh losing him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey
all alone
Forgetting him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah yeah red
We're burning red
And that's why he's spinnin'
'round in my head
Comes back to me burning red
Yeah yeah
His love was like
driving a new Maserati
down a dead-end street"
All Too Well,440,Taylor Swift,"I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
The Last Time (Feat. Gary Lightbody),536,Taylor Swift,"Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart
in the blink of an eye
eye eye
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
And right before your eyes
I'm aching no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me-he-e-he-e-he-e-
he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart
in the blink of an eye
eye eye
This is the last time
you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time
I say it's been you all along
This is the last time
I let you in my door
This is the last time
I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
Oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart

This is the last time
I'm asking you this
This is the last time
I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
Put my name at the top of your list

But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps
up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to
call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to
call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I've watched you so long
screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night
for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore"
Bridge Over Troubled Water,273,Simon & Garfunkel,"When you're weary
feelin small
when tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side oh
when times get rough
And friend just
can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled
water I'll lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled
water I'll lay me down

When you're down and out
when you're on the street
when evening fall so hard
I will comfort you
I'm take your part oh
when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled
water I'll lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled
water I'll lay me down

Sail on silver girl
sail on by
your time has come to shine
All your dreams are
on their way
See how they shine oh
if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over triubled
water I'll aese your mind
Like a bridge over triubled
water I'll aese your mind"

Dance Me To The End Of Love,212,Leonard Cohen,"dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
dance me through the panic till I’m gathered safely in
lift me like an olive branch and be my
homeward dove
dance me to the end of love

dance me to your beauty when the witness are gone
let me feel you moving like they do in babylon
show me slowly what I only know the limits of
dance me to the end of love

dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
we’re both of us beeath our love, we’re both of us above
dance me to the end of love

dance me to the children who are asking to be born
dance me through the curtains that
our kisses have outworn

raise a tent of shelter now though every thread is torn
dance me to the end of love

dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
dance me through the panic till
I’m gathered safely in
touch me with your naked hand or
touch me with your glove
dance me to the end of love"
April Come She Will,30,Simon & Garfunkel,"April come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain;
May, she will stay,
Resting in my arms again.

June, she'll change her tune,
In restless walks she'll prowl the night;
July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight.

August, die she must,
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old."
The Only Living Boy In New York,381,Simon & Garfunkel,"Tom get your plane right on time
I know your part'll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Da n da da n da n da da
and here I am
The only living boy in New York
I get the news I need
on the weather report
I can gather all the news
I need on the weather report
Hey I've got nothing
to do today but smile
Da n da da n da da n da da
here I am
The only living boy in New York
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where
And we don't know here
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where
And we don't know here
Tom get your plane right on time
I know you've been
eager to fly now
Hey let your honesty shine
shine shine
Da n da da n da da n da da
Like it shines on me
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York"
Vincent,210,Don McLean,"Starry Starry night
paint your palette
blue and grey
Look out on a summers day
with eyes that know
the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
sketch the trees
and the daffodils
Catch the breeze
and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy
linen land
and now I under stand
what you tried to say to me
How you suffered
for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen
they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry Starry night
flaming flowrs
that brightly biaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
reflect in Vincent's eyes
of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath
the artists loving hand
And now i under stand
what you tried to say to me
How you suffered
for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen
they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
for they could not love you
but still your love was true
and when no hope was left in
sight on that
starry starry night
you took your life
as lovers of ten do
but i could have
told you Vincent
This world was never meant for
one as beautiful as you
Starry Starry night
portraits hung in empty halls
frame less heads
on name less walls
with eyes that watch the world
and can't for get
like the stran gers
that you've met
the ragged men in ragged clothes
the silver thorn of bloody rose
lie crushed and broken
on the virgin snow
and now i think i know
what you tried to say to me
How you suffered
for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen
they're not listning
still perhaps they never will"
Wild World,309,Cat Stevens,"Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'

nice things to wear

Rhinestone Cowboy,47,Glen Campbell,"Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy





I've been walking these streets so long

Singing the same old song

I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway

Where hustle is the name of the game

And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain

There's been a load of compromising

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me



후렴 : Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy

Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers coming over the phone



Well I really don't mind the rain

And a smile can hide all the pain

But you're down when you're riding a train

That's taking the long way

And I dream of the thing I'll do

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There's been a load of compromising

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me"
New York City,"3,168",Norah Jones & Peter Malick Group,"I can`t remember
what I planned tomorrow
I can`t remember
when it`s time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came before
I wanted to think
there was endless love
Until I saw the light
dim in your eyes
In the dead of the night
I found out
Sometimes there`s love
that won`t survive
New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful disease
Laura kept all her disappointments
Locked up in a box behind
her closet door
She pulled the blinds
and listened to the thunder
With no way out
from the family store
We all told her things
could get better
When you just say goodbye
I`ll lay awake one more night
Caught in a vision I want to deny
And did I mention
the note that I found
Taped to my locked front door
It talked about no regrets
As it slipped from my hand
to the scuffed tile floor
I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie`s lullaby
New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful disease
We were full of the stuff
that every dream rested
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattooed conclusion
That the big one was
knocking on the door
What started as a mass delusion
Would take me far from
the place I adore
New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
You are my beautiful
Such a beautiful disease"
Empty,217,Ray LaMontagne,"She lifts her skirt up to her knees
Walks through the garden rows with her barefeet, laughing
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters.

I walk on down the hill
through grass grown tall and brown
and still it's hard somehow to let go of my pain
On past the busted back
of this old and rusted Cadillac
that sinks into this field collecting rain

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged.

Of these cutthroat, busted sunsets
These cold and damp, white mornings I've grown weary
If through these cracked and dusty dimestore lips
I spoke these words out loud
No one would hear me.

Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from your hair
and kiss me with that country mouth, so plain.
Outside the rain is tapping on the leaves
to me, it sounds like they're applauding us
The quiet love we've made

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged.

Well I looked my demons in the eyes
Laid bare my chest said do your best and destroy me
See I've been to hell and back so many times
I must admit you kind of bore me

There's a lot of things that can kill a man
There's a lot of ways to die
Yes and some already dead that walk beside you
There's a lot of things I don't understand
Why so many people lie
Well it's the hurt I hide that fuels the fires inside me

Will I always feel this way
So empty, so estranged"
Should've Said No,"1,130",Taylor Swift,"It's strange to think the
songs we used to sing
the smiles the flowers
everything is gone
yesterday I found out about you
even now just looking at you
feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes
You should've said no
you should've gone home
you should've thought twice
before you let it all go
you should've known that word
bout what you did with her
would get back to me
get back to me
and I Should've been there
in the back of you mind
and I shouldn't be
asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for my
forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no
baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
and baby you know
all the right things
to say
but do you honestly expect me
to believe
we could ever be the same
you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of
weakness and you said yes
You should've said no
you should've gone home
you should've thought twice
before you let it all go
you should've known that word

baby and you might still have me

I can't resist
before you go tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this
no no no no no no
You should've said no
you should've gone home
you should've thought twice
before you let it all go
you should've known that word
bout what you did with her

Last Chance,"1,244",M.Y.M.P,"This is my last dance with you

This is my only chance to do all I can do

To let you know that what I feel for you is real

This is the last chance for us

This is the moment that I just cannot let end

Before I know that there is a chance were more than friends

So don’t let go, don’t let go

Make it last all night

This is my last chance to make you mine

I kept my feelings so deep

I kept my dreams of you and me somewhere inside

Although I prayed that you would see it in my eyes

But this is my last chance to say

What’s in my heart before you stay out of my life

And then you’ll understand the way I feel inside

So hold me close ‘cause it feels so right

This is my last chance to make it mine

Make this dream reality

So close and yet so far

Gotta find a way into your heart

Gotta speak my mind

Gotta open up to you this time

I can’t let you slip away tonight

This is my last chance with you

This is my only chance to do all I can do

To let you know that what I feel for you is so real

So don’t let go

Just make it last all night long

This is my last chance to make you mine, yeah

To make you mine"
Sparks Fly (Live From Chicago / 2011),543,Taylor Swift,"Drop everything now

The way you move is like a

full on rainstorm

And I'm a house of cards

You're the

kind of reckless that should

send me running

But I kinda know that I

won't get far

And you stood there

in front of me

Just close enough to touch

Close enough to hope you

couldn't see

What I was thinking of

Drop everything now

Meet me in the pouring rain

Kiss me on the sidewalk

Take away the pain

Cause' I see sparks fly

whenever you smile

Get me with those green

eyes baby

As the lights go down

Give me something that'll

haunt me

when you're not around

Cause I see sparks fly

whenever you smile



My mind forgets to remind me

you're a bad idea

You touch me once and it's

really something

You find I'm even better

than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the

rest of the world

But with you

I know it's no good

And I could wait

patiently but

I really wish you would

Drop everything now

Meet me in the pouring rain

Kiss me on the sidewalk

Take away the pain

Cause I see sparks fly

whenever you smile

Get me with those green

eyes baby

As the lights go down

Give me something that'll haunt

me when you're not around

Cause I see sparks fly

whenever you smile



I run my fingers through

your hair

And watch the lights go wild

Just keep on keeping your

eyes on me

It's just strong enough to make it

feel right

And lead me up the staircase

Won't you whisper soft and slow

I'm captivated by you baby

Like a fireworks show

Drop everything now

Meet me in the pouring rain

Kiss me on the sidewalk

Take away the pain

Cause I see sparks fly

whenever you smile

Get me with those green

eyes baby

As the lights go down

Give me something that'll haunt me

when you're

not around

Cause I see sparks fly

whenever you smile"

19 You + Me,"1,998",Dan + Shay,"It was I first week Myrtle Beach
Where it all began
It was a 102 nothin to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in
We were summertime
sippin' sippin'
sweet tea kissing off of your lips
T shirt drippin' drippin' wet
How could I forget
Watching that blonde hair swing
to every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashing down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer
of 19 you and me
We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up so in love
Let's just stay night here
till the sun starts creepin'
creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin'
thinkin' of
When i looked at you
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
to every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
that day we had to leave
It was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer
of 19 you and me
You and me
Watching that blonde hair swing
to every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful Beautiful
Watching that blown hair swing
to every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playing everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
of every wave crashin' down

I Knew This Would Be Love,"1,010",Imaginary Friend,"It's funny how we met on the telephone
You and I on the edge of the unknown
Oh in only a moment's time
I knew my heart was yours and yours was mine
When I saw you waiting at your place
Something felt familiar in your face
Oh you smiled as if to say
I knew my heart was yours from the first day
We were right
We stood through it all
Holding tight
Whenever we fall
What we found is second to none
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
There were days when I thought I'd lost you
I read the letter aloud what could I do
Now we're right back where we belong
Don't second guess your heart it's never wrong
We were right
We stood through it all
Holding tight
Whenever we fall
What we found is second to none
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love"

Georgia,849,Vance Joy,"She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul
And I could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me
will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind
Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up
And I, I never understood
what was at stake
I never thought your love was
worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling in your mind
Won't you let it be

Before He Cheats,302,Carrie Underwood,"Right now he's probably slow dancing

and she's probably getting frisky
right now, he's probably buying
her some fruity little drink
'cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up
behind her with a pool stick
showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
That I dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up
4 wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger
to both headlights
slashed a hole in all 4 tires
Maybe next time he'll think
before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up
singing some
white trash version
of Shania karaoke
Right now,
she's probably saying, I'm drunk
and he's a thinking that
he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably
dabbing on
3 dollars worth of
that bathroom Polo*
Oh, and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up
4 wheel drive
carved my name into
his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger
to both headlights
slashed a hole in all 4 tires
Maybe next time he'll think
before he cheats
I might've saved a little trouble
for the next girl
'cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No not on me

October,38,Rosie Thomas,"Make her a flower in late December
When the sun is not shining on her
Write her a love song and play it all day long
To remind her of all that she is worth
Never never leave her
Take her on long drives for ice cream by sea sides
And give her your coat when she is cold
Tell her you miss her when you're close enough to kiss her
And that you'd walk a thousand miles to tell her so
But never never leave her
Take photographs of her on Brooklyn street in October
When her nervous smile is slightly curved
Some days when she is slightly down tell her it's okay to frown
It makes you just fall more in love with her
But never never leave her"

Bad Boys Need Love Too,823,Bahamas,"Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
For all the deadbeat dads
And the kids that they had
The ones that's left behind
that's always up on their minds
To know that there's no excuse
To leave a boy in his youth
And now that dirty secret's
just some ugly truth
To be left all alone
To never pick up the phone
And all the things I learned
I guess I learned on my own
But what's done has been done
And now your only son
Wants to share the love with you
he got from his mom
I said
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
I was still just a kid
Barely out of my crib
Left alone at home
yes I was raising my sibs
While my mother got paid
Always at someone's aid
She missed us kissed us
told us that she'd be home late
Now her kids is full grown
They've got kids of their own
Put the past behind you
mind you you're never alone
Cause my brothers they're two
Yes I got a nephew
Can't change who you are
until you change what you do
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Pull from the earth
Every last thing of worth
To know the soil is free of oil
to make that your work
To know that we share
The same water and air
So can't we be more mindful
of what we put in there
Cause we can't be surprised
When the oceans do rise
To tell yourself you'll be okay
is to tell yourself lies
So let's change how we live
Less take and more give
It's in my mother's nature
now to always forgive
I said
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout
Bad boys need love too
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout

Make It Sweet,46,Old Dominion,"I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Verse 2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Bridge]
Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet
Oh yeah"
Magnet Balls (feat. Jana Iris),186,Augustin,"Everytime I look at you
you slowly drift away
Your eyes are shut
and still you seem to see
the inner me
Everytime you touch my hand
I shrugg off anyway
But still you are
a field of energy
surrounding me
Ohh we move like magnet balls
Ohh we move like magnet balls
Everytime you try to walk
away with all your strength
Some kind of power
pulls you back again
Feels better then
Every try to leave behind
the cave in wich we stand
it leaves a wound
that someone has to mend
my only friend
Ohh we move like magnet balls
Ohh we move like magnet balls
Ohh we move like magnet balls
Ohh we move like magnet balls
Ohh we move like magnet balls
Ohh we move like magnet balls"

ICU,108,Phoebe Bridgers,"Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

[Verse 2]
If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

[Verse 3]
I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

I'll climb through the window again
But right now, it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open

Decimal,326,Novo Amor,"Could you let me know
I could make some time
if you wanted
Couldn't find the phone
I guess I got it that summer
you said
I could be alright
if you could re-write my life
And I said it won't phase me
but I reckon I may've been wrong
I should let this go
I could be your water instead
I'll put on my coat
'Cause I could hear you stall
in the way you said
Is it alright to feel like I do at all
Got caught up in the skylight
And the words just all came out wrong
Just called to let you know
This all is getting old
And I could be your water instead
Let me get my head aligned
Let my life be worth your while
Bend my arm I won't be far at all"
Clothes,479,Cian Ducrot,"I didn't know that
she was dancing right beside me
I only noticed
when she asked me so politely
could you play my favourite song
Latchin' on to all the words
that I was singing
It wasn't hard to feel the heat
that she was bringing
But she was stringing me along
We danced the night away
She told me she would
stay the night at my place
But in the morning I called to say
You left some clothes last night
And I wonder who you are
And I wonder are you far
You left still on my mind
And I'll never feel the same
Didn't even catch your name
She was drinking me
underneath the table
Tried to keep up
when I knew I wasn't able
She told me
practice what you preach
Then she kissed me
when I wasn't expecting
Didn't think that
it would go in that direction
I guess its time for us to leave
We danced the night away
She told me she would
stay the night at my place
But in the morning I called to say
You left some clothes last night
And I wonder who you are
And I wonder are you far
You left still on my mind
And I'll never feel the same
Didn't even catch your name
You left some clothes last night
And I wonder who you are
And I wonder are you far
You left still on my mind
And I'll never feel the same
Didn't even catch your name"
Mine,232,Rachel Horter,"Just wanna know
You got me wondering
If you're there all alone
I'm on my couch
Wish you were blowing up
my phone
Something to let me know
that you're thinking of me
I'm sitting down
Just here wanting you
To come and take me out
With that dress
That's sitting in my closet how
Could I be such a fool
To even get it
I knew i wouldn't wear it
But how do you think
it's fine to forget about me
And how do you not see me
Why does it have to be so hard
Wishing you were mine
Every time that we're apart
I'm wishing you were mine
My heart is torn
Subtle tricks don't do it
For me anymore
So how about
You give me something more
Before I decide against it all yeah
And how do you think
it's fine to forget about me
And how do you not see me
Why does it have to be so hard
Wishing you were mine
Every time that we're apart
I'm wishing you were mine
I'm holding on to
what could happen
I feel like we could win
if you'd just let it
So come on be my babe
you know I feel it
But it's all in my head
And how do you think
it's fine to forget about me
And how do you not see me
Why does it have to be so hard
Wishing you were mine
Every time that we're apart
I'm wishing you were mine"

Song for Nick Drake,61,Skullcrusher,"All day at the bookstore
Curled up in the same chair
I was lost
In what we shared

[Verse 2]
On a train to Fleetwood
It began to rain
No one came
To get me
From the station

[Verse 3]
I walked home alone
With your song in my head
Finally understanding something
In what you said
In the moment
How the rain smelled
And I know now
And I know now
And I know now"

Turnham Green,7,Adam Melchor,"you picked your chair to sit in
you made the bed in which you lay
i used to tuck you in it
you let your dreams take you away
the clock was always tickin
i fought it off and stayed awake
but now these nights look different
the colors dyed another way

so you asked me what would i do
if just for a minute i was you

i took every step
in your heart and in your head
i see what you see
but nothing looks right
you brought me somewhere i’d never be

you carved out your decision
before you took the turn from me
the life we almost lived in
the mornings walking turnham green

so you asked me what would i do
if just for a minute i was you

i took every step
in your heart and in your head
i see what you see
but nothing looks right
you brought me somewhere i’d never be

i took every step

New paths on old ground
Wildflowers and bird songs

Novel in my hand
Propped up in the fine sand
By a lake in the summer
No name, no number

I am free, I’m free in my mind
I am free, I’m free in my mind

In a dream, on a long ride
On a stream in the sunshine
Eyes closed, with my headphones
Listening to the unknown

I am free, I’m free in my mind
I am free, I’m free in my mind

And the stress it unwinds
To a pulse of true time
And the symbols they rhyme
Pouring out into my mind

I’m here feeling it all
I’m here, big and small
I can do anything
I can do nothing

I am free, I’m free in my mind
I am free, I’m free in my mind"

You know I love you
But everything heaven-sent
Must burn out in the end
I promised you

Just as you were in my dream
Now let me off easy
And I’ll slip down through the drain
To release my scattered brain
My enemy

Something just isn’t right
I cut from the inside
I’m frightened of the end
I’m drowning in my self-defense
Now punish me

Think of me as what you will
I grow like a cancer
I’m pressed out in the rain
Deliver me from the poisoned pain"

I Remember,642,Damien Rice,"I remember it well
The first time that I saw
Your head around the door
Cause mine stopped working
I remember it well
There was wet in your hair
I was stood in the stairs
And time stopped moving
I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Cause I can't believe
what I found
I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Nothing is taking me
down down down

I remember it well
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing
I remember it well
I was stood in your line
And your mouth
your mouth your mouth

I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Cause I can't believe
what I found
I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Nothing is taking me
down down down

Except you my love

Except you my love

Come all ye lost
Dive into moss
I hope that my sanity
covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper mach

Come all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This is love this is porn
God will forgive me But I
I whip myself scorn scorn
I wanna hear
what you have to say about me
Hear
if you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear what you want
I remember december
And I wanna hear
what you have to say about me

but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again
and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight
tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special
just another wide eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall superstar
Good morning lonelinеss
Comes around
when I'm not dreaming about you
Whеn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways
to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight
tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special
just another wide eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall superstar
You played in bars
you play guitar
And I'm invisible and
everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see
you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight
tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special
just another wide eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you

Sweet Music Man,88,Kenny Rogers,"She said sing your song, Sweet Music Man
'Cause I won't be there to hold your hand
Like I used to, I'm thru with you
You're a hell of a singer and a powerful man
But you surround yourself with people who demand, so little of you.

You touched my soul, with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along
Right with you, and said I need you
Then you changed the words and added harmony
Sang the song you had written for me, to someone new.

Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else could make me sing along
Nobody else could make me feel
That things are right, when I know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you.

She said sing your song, Sweet Music Man
You travel the world with a six-piece band
That does for you, what you ask 'em to
And you try to stay young, but the songs are sung
So many people have all begun, to come back on you.

So, sing your song, sad music man
You're makin' your livin', doin' one night stands
It proves to you, they don't need you
You're still a hell of a singer, but a broken man
But you keep on a-lookin' for one last fan, to sing to.

Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else could make me sing along
Nobody else could make me feel
That things are right when they're wrong, with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you.

She said sing your song, Sweet Music Man, I believe in you."
Ruby Tuesday,85,Melanie Safka,"She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright or in the darkest night
no one knows she comes and goes
* Good bye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
at such a cost
* Repeat

""There's no time to lose""
I need her say
Catch your dreams
Before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?
*Repeat"

굽이쳐 흘러내리는 천사의 머리카락
And ice cream castles in the air
그리고 하늘에 떠 있는 아이스크림 성
And feather canyons everywhere
여기저기 자리잡은 깃털 모양의 협곡들
I've looked at clouds that way
난 구름을 그렇게 봤었지요
But now they only block the sun
하지만 이제 구름은
태양을 가리는 존재일 뿐이에요
They rain and snow on everyone
모든 사람에게 짓궂게 비와 눈을 뿌리는...
So many things I would have done
많은 일을 하려고 했지만
But clouds got in my way
구름이 날 방해했죠

I look at clouds from both sides now
난 이제 구름의 양면을 다 보아요
From up and down, and still somehow
또 아래 위로도요, 하지만 아직도 어쩐지
It's clouds' illusions I recall
기억나는 것은 구름이 주는 착각이죠
I really don't know clouds at all
정말 구름이 뭔지 잘 모르겠어요

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
달님과 싱그러운 유월 그리고 유원지의 회전 관람차
The dizzy dancing way you feel
춤추듯 어지러운 기분이죠
When every fairy tale comes real
모든 동화 속 이야기가 현실로 나타나는 것처럼
I've looked at love that way
나는 사랑을 그렇게 아름다운 것으로 보아왔죠
But now it's just another show
하지만 이젠 사랑은 단지
또 하나의 연극에 지나지 않아요
You leave them laughing when you go
떠날 땐 사람들이 웃을 수 있게 하세요
And if you care, don't let them know
그들을 배려한다면 그들이 모르도록 해요
Don't give yourself away
본심을 드러내지 마세요

I look at love from both sides now
난 사랑의 양면을 생각하게 됐어요
From win and lose and still somehow
주고 받는 것에대해 그렇지만 여전히
It's love's illusions I recall
생각나는 것은 사랑이 주는 오해입니다
I really don't know love at all
사랑이 뭔지 정말 모르겠어요

Tears and fears and feeling proud
눈물과 두려움, 또
To say I love you cried out loud
'사랑해'라고 바로 큰 소리로 외칠 수 있는 자신감
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
미래에 대한 꿈과 계획, 서커스의 구경꾼들
I've looked at life that way
나는 인생을 그런 식으로 보아왔죠
But now old friends are acting strange
하지만 이제 오랜 친구들이 낯설게 행동하네요
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
설레설레 머리를 저으며 나더러 변했다는 거예요
Well, something's lost, but something's gained
하지만 잃는 것도 있고 얻는 것도 있는 거죠
In living every day
하루 하루의 삶은 말이죠

I look at life from both sides now
나는 이제 인생의 양면을 봅니다
From win and lose, and still somehow
얻기도 하고 잃기도 하는, 하지만 여전히
It's life's illusions I recall
생각하게 되는 것은 삶의 기만적인 모습이죠
I really don't know life at all
인생이 뭔지 정말 모르겠어요"
I Am A Rock,205,Simon & Garfunkel,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark December


I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island


I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need for friendship
Friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock
I am an island


Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I'd never loved,
I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island


I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no-one and no-one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island


And the rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"
Amazing Grace,"1,771",Judy Collins,"Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
'Twas grace that
taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers
toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace that
brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home
When we've been there
ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
to sing God's praise
Than when we first began
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see"
Them There Eyes (Soundtrack Ver.),105,Diana Ross,"I fell in love with you
The first time I looked into
Them there eyes
Cause you have a certain
Little cute way of

In a great big way for you

They sparkle

Gonna get you in a

Forever & Always,"1,160",Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
When I caught your eye
we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone
and he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me
to the core Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
But I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone
and he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so

Oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything
Back up baby back up did you
forget everything
'Cause it rains in your
bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone
and he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when we said
forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't mean it baby you said
forever and always"
Arms Of A Woman,767,Amos Lee,"I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
most of my days i spend alone
A thousand miles
from the place i was born
But when she wakes me
she takes me back home
Now most days
i spend like a child
Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind
I know there aint nothing out there
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
most of my days a i spend alone
A thousand miles
the place i was born
When she wakes me
she takes me back home
A thousand miles
the place i was born
When she wakes me
she takes me back home
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
most of my days i spend alone
A thousand miles
from the place i was born
When she wakes me
she takes me
Ya when she wakes me
she takes me back home
When she wakes me
she takes me back home
When she wakes me
she takes me back home"
I Don't Feel It Anymore (Song Of The Sparrow),484,William Fitzsimmons,"Hold on this will
Hurt more than anything has before
What it was what it was what it was
I've brought this on us
More than anyone could ignore
What I've done
what I've done what I've done
I've worked for so long
Just to see you mess around
What you've done
what you've done what you've done
I want back the years that you took
When I was young
I was young I was young
But it's done
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
We'll fall just like stars
being hung by only string
Everything everything here is gone
No map can direct how
To ever make it home
We're alone we're alone we're alone
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away"
Walk In The Park,"1,110",Charity Vance,"He says he's not afraid to love me
So why am I
I picture everything going smooth as can be
but that's a lie
And it always ends up
That it's always my fault
cause I always mess up
and it's you that I call
Who forgot to mention that
love isn't always a walk in the park
Who misplaced the memo
and now you've got me wandering around
in the dark
I don't want to go very far from you
you've gotta know that I'm learning too
to fall and get back up
Oh he's the only one I want to be with
that's not the problem
It's more of it's too far
and who's gonna drive the car
hush our pretty little lips
to these pretty little fits and
Better days out weigh the bad ones
what we have only happens once
Who forgot to mention that
love isn't always a walk in the park
Who misplaced the memo
and now you've got me wandering around
in the dark
I don't want to go very far from you
you've gotta know that I'm learning too
to fall and get back up
Well they forgot to mention
in the mail that
This isn't free and there are strings
but I've gotta say that you're the best thing that has
happened to me since 19 something
Love is sweet with a side of bitter
I'm in love so I'm doing better
Still the question remains
Who forgot to mention that love
isn't always a walk in the park
Who misplaced the memo
and now you've got me wandering around
in the dark
I never liked the dark"
That Wasn't Me,927,Brandi Carlile,"Hang on just hang
on for a minute
I've got something
to say
I'm not asking you
to move on or
forget it
But these are
better days
To be wrong all
along and admit
is not amazing grace
But to be loved
like a song
you remember
Even when you've
changed
Tell me did I
go on a tangent
Did I lie through
my teeth
Did I cause you
to stumble on
your feet
Did I bring shame
on my family
Did it show when
I was weak
Whatever you see
that wasn't me
That wasn't me
that wasn't me
When you're lost
you will toss
every lucky coin
you'll ever trust
And you will hide
from every god
like he never
turns his back
on us
And you will fall
all the way to the
bottom and fall
on your own knife
But you'll learn
who you are even
if it doesn't
take your life
Tell me did I go
on a tangent
Did I lie through
my teeth
Did I cause you
to stumble on
your feet
Did I bring shame
on my family
Did it show when
I was weak
Whatever you see
that wasn't me
That wasn't me
that wasn't me
But I want you to
know that you'll
never alone
I wanna believe do
I make myself a
blessing to everyone
I meet
When you fall
I will get you on
your feet
Do I spend time
with my family
Did it show when
I was weak
When that's what
you see that
will be me
That will be me
that will be me
That will be me"
Wonderful Tonight,578,Eric Clapton,"""It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear.
She'll put on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair.
And then she asks me, """"Do I look all right?""""
And I say, """"Yes, you look wonderful tonight.""""

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me.
And then she asks me, """"Do you feel all right?""""
And I say, """"Yes, I feel wonderful tonight.""""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes.

And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.
It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head,
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.

And then I tell her, as I turn out the light,
I say, """"My darling, you were wonderful tonight.
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight.""""

Walk softer softer

Geronimo (Acoustic Ver.),523,The Beach,"Smoke in my lungs
I'm dead and gone
I was alive but the feeling has gone
Wish I can feel again
I'm on my own
Just throwing stones in to the water
But they don't know how to float
Wish I could breathe again
I was in the ground
and the space don't feel the same
I was looking down
And she said my love could change
What are you waiting for
She looks in my eyes
Felt like the first time
I saw a sunrise
Said what you waiting for
She let the fire burn
As the world turns
She said don't let go
I said Geronimo
She's in my bones
It's in the air
It's in her stare
I try to touch it
As I watch it disappear
Are you really here
Cause I don't know
If I can go
Such a long time without
Seeing you again
Do you remember when
I was in the ground
and the space don't feel the same
I was looking down
And she said my love could change
She looks in my eyes
Felt like the first time
I saw a sunrise
Said what you waiting for

Couldn't feel my heartbeat
I was living the dark
Til the light you gave me
I was looking down
And she said my love has changed

Said what you waiting for

Lake Shore Drive,698,Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah,"There's a road I'd like to tell you
about, lives in my hometown
Lake Shore Drive the road is called
and it'll take you up or down
From rats on up to riches,
fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way
help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with
a heavenly grace help you right on by
And there ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive
heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday night trouble bound
And it starts up north from Hollywood,
water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up,
throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green
if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be
than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind or
place you see riding on Lake Shore Drive
And there ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive
heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday night trouble bound
And it's Friday night and you're
looking clean,
too early to start the rounds
A ten-minute ride from the Gold Coast
back, make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning
and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake
Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning
time, tomorrow is another day
Woo
And there ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive
heading into town
Just snaking on by on LSD,
Friday night trouble bound"

To feel alone

When the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
In the dark every lights gone out
And there's nothing left to see
I hear her voice
softly calling out
To go the depth and feel the wait
And the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
And the nights are long
And the days go on
And you feel like home"

Has brought me to you
I got a scar I don't try to hide it
It's forever mine
Got a heart so long to find it
Can't remember why
You'll never know what you can be
Till ya come to realize
In the rearview all that has hurt you
It's just a passerby
'Cause you're here I'm here
Right now right now
Not lost not lost but found
And everything I've done
Has brought me to you
Now I hold my head high
You can see it in my eyes
I won't turn away
If the darkness comes I'll stay
I'll stay
'Cause I'm here I'm here
Right now right now
Not lost not lost but found
And everything I've done
Has brought me to you
I'm here I'm here
Right now right now

Oh I Miss Her So (feat. Mary Lattimore),304,Holy Hive,"My honey likes
the sunshine on her face
I wish that I could
blow the clouds away
But I don't have lungs
big enough today
Not even for goodbye
And she wants to fly far away
To a bluer sky and sunny days
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
She knows
that I prefer my ocean grey
That way that it
moves on stormy days
She doesn't have
a heart to make it rain
Not even for to cry
And she wants to fly far away
To a bluer sky and sunny days
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so"
The Girl Who Fell in Love with the Sun,291,dozen districts,"Indigo submerged in gold
Glowing brighter
than the daylight with
Undertones of gloomy night skies
It's so calm and yet so harsh
How the shades fell on her body
While she is washed away slowly
There is not much that I know
What's going on below
That skin she scared
can't be undone
They told me I should go
Far and far away from the girl
who fell in love
With the sun
She's a writer once a fighter
Saved her heart
from being slaughtered but
Wasted words on former lovers
And from time to time
she keeps telling herself
it's fine
Like petals holding on to flowers
She's kept away
from daylight for hours
When the demons take control
The cigarette she holds
No longer be her kind of fun
Oh maybe I should go cos'
I could fall in love with the girl
who fell in love
With the sun
But then I
Can't complain she keeps me sane
You need to sunk a while beneath
To crave the air
you always breathe
Pulverised yet so divine
Heavy clouds ready to break
she is
Yearning for the ocean to embrace
In my arms where she'll feel safe
All of her mistakes
For once feels like
it's been undone
Oh little did I know
I have fell in love with the girl
who fell in love
With the sun
I have fell in love with the girl
who fell in love with the sun
I have fell in love with the girl
who fell in love with the sun"
Lady by the Sea,101,Stephen Sanchez,"Dame with eyes of green
Legs lie soft on the sand beside the sea
With tilted shades, beaming eyes they looked at me
As if to say, “pull in your reel, pretty boy, and stop lookin’ this way”

But, ooo I love it
When you talk to me like you do

Oh, my lady by the sea, come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, come and lie next to me

Your voice it blooms the flowers on the beach
With lips that glisten in the moon light every time you speak
A somber tone of men I’ve known, bein lonely, oh, so lonely
But, Luckily, luckily she’s got her eyes on me

But, ooo I love it
When you talk to me like you do

Oh, my lady by the sea, come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, come and lie next to me"

Tom's Diner,170,Suzanne Vega,"I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in

Verse 2
It is always nice to see you, says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them, and instead I pour the milk

Verse 3
I open up the paper, there's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking, it was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head

Verse 4
There's a woman on the outside looking inside, does she see me
No, she does not really see me 'cause she sees her own reflection
And I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet

Verse 5
Oh, this rain, it will continue through the morning as I'm listening
To the bells of the cathedral
I am thinking of your voice

Verse 6
And of the midnight picnic once upon a time before the rain began
And I finish up my coffee
And it's time to catch the train

Bigger Houses,67,Dan + Shay,"Used to dream about buying that bigger house, sitting on top of some hill
Losing sleep about filling my bank account, wondering if I ever will

But the older I get, I just care less and less 'bout keeping up with people named Jones
If you don't fill it up with somebody that you love, it ain't ever gonna feel like home

There's always gonna be a higher high
You could chase for the rest of your life
Greener grass in the yard next door
Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an empty cup if what you got's still not enough
The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

I can hear the kids making little footsteps, running down the hallway upstairs
I can see the dogs playing in the back yard, through the kitchen window right there

Maybe life's kinda more 'bout a swing on the porch, holding her while the sun disappears
Why would I wanna be anywhere else in the world when my whole world is sitting right here?

There's always gonna be a higher high
You could chase for the rest of your life
Greener grass in the yard next door
Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an empty cup if what you got's still not enough
The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

No-no, no-no, no-no

There's always gonna be a higher high
You could chase for the rest of your life
Greener grass in the yard next door
Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an empty cup if what you got's still not enough
The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

El Dorado,12,Zach Bryan,"Did you ever make it back to El Dorado
I’d call and ask but hell if I know
If I still got your number or if you care
You moved away when you was younger
Was it escape or was it hunger
Kansas ain’t no place to be a man
You used to say you’d settle down
With that kind girl from school in town
She was gone before you got back home

To El dorado hell if I know
If you’re still alive
There’s a note in the glovebox of your drive
El Dorado hell if they know
The difference in a year
And a man I wish was still by my side

17 years old how our grins look scary brave
My momma always said we look so handsome when we shave
You used to say if not you then who
And you’d go a thousand times or two
Now your names up on a sign in el dorado driving through

In El dorado hell if I know
If you’re still alive
There’s a note in the glovebox of your drive
El Dorado hell if they know
The difference in a year
And a man I wish was still by my side
You’re in every last memory alive

And I called last week to talk
To my favorite old devil dog
They told he had finally headed home"

So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

You gave me no answers
Nor asked me to lie
You just gave me an amethyst
From your jeweled vest as you cried

You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

We shared in the basement
As the fern bent to the window
And we drew to alignment
As the water soaked the pillow

So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
You come around, I'm ruined"

Sense of Home,795,Harrison Storm,"For these words
he won't come around here
And his eyes won't see
And you know
he won't come around here
He needs it to be
It's like something evil
is taking a hold
nothing deep here
It's like we're losing
our sense of home
Just dissapear
Just dissapear
Tell your mother you're leaving here
Tell your brother you're going away
Tell your mother
she needs to reassure herself
And this will be the only way
Sometimes he tries to reassure
himself
That it's all still there
Almost times he just cries to himself
Sunk deep into his chair
Tell your brother
you're listening to his dreams
Tell your sister she is all you need
Tell your mother she is the only one
And your father has made
you all that you've become
cause these words
aren't meant for anyone else
but your family
Tell your brother
you're listening to his dreams
Tell your sister she is all you need
Tell your mother she is the only one
And your father has made you
all that you've become
And your father has made you
all that you've become"
You Missed My Heart,186,Phoebe Bridgers,"Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go
He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watch him fall down as the morning sun rose
He looked at me

He said You missed my heart
You missed my heart
You got me good
I knew you would
But you missed my heart
You missed my heart
Were his last words before he died

Looking out the window up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost control
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
Underneath the whimpering I could hear the siren sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I miss
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin when she started laughing
While I clenched down on her wrists, she said That's quite a list
But there's one thing you missed

You missed my heart
You missed my heart
That's quite a list
But what you really missed
You missed my heart
You missed my heart
That's quite a list
But what you really missed

Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policeman on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose but I failed and I broke loose
I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rights
And just before everything went dark

I said, You missed my heart
You missed my heart
He got me good
I knew he would
But he missed my heart
He missed my heart
And just before everything went dark

The most poetic dream
Came flowing like the sea
Laying there my life blood draining out of me
A childhood scene, night sky, moonbeams
Fishing with my friends, sitting in the wild reeds
Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite

Down river from the Moundsville prison graveyard"
Look What God Gave Her,533,Thomas Rhett,"Don't even want the attention
But yeah
that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and
she's spinning around yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh I'm in Heaven I swear
right now
And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind
Look what God gave her
How perfect He made her
She walks in the room
It's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves
How could anybody blame her
I know she's got haters
But it ain't her fault nah
Look what God gave her
It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here
this evening
I thought yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building
so hot
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith
Look what God gave her
How perfect He made her
She walks in the room
It's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves
How could anybody blame her
I know she's got haters
But it ain't her fault nah
Look what God gave her
Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah I think I've seen the light
Every kiss I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man I swear I've seen the light
Look what God gave her
How perfect He made her
She walks in the room
It's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves
How could anybody blame her
I know she's got haters
But it ain't her fault nah
Look what God gave her
Uuh uh
UUh look what God gave her
Look what God gave her
Uuh uh
Oh yeah look what God gave her"
Beauty In The Mundane (Feat. Cody Francis),70,Bird Of Figment,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday, there was sun and there was rain
Beauty in the mundane
And as the light, startled our eyes
We let go of disguise
And now, there's something in the air
And a sparkly shimmer on our skin
Restoring everything within

[Chorus]
Oh
Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel beyond all

[Verse 2]
Hand in hand, building castles out of sand
Reaching for the grand
As willows align, we lose track of time
Head up high, now we climb

[Chorus]
Oh
Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel, beyond all

[Bridge]
A bigger scale the world inhales
As we go
I wouldn't want it any other way, no

[Chorus]
Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel, beyond all

Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel, beyond all"

If I Needed You,214,Emmylou Harris,"If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain
Well the night's forelorn
And the morning's born
And the morning's born
With the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
And that would break
My heart in two
If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain

Baby's with me now
Since I showed her how
To lay her lilly Hand in mine
Who would ill agree
She's a sight to see
A treasure for
The poor to find
If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain"
A Case of You,517,Joni Mitchell,"Just before our love
got lost you said
I am as constant
as a northern star
And I said constantly
in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar
On the back of a carton coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face
sketched on it twice
Oh you're in
my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink
a case of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet
Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones
that ain't afraid
I remember that time
you told me you said
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine
Cause part you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh you're in
my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink
a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils
and your deeds
And she said
Go to him
stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed
Oh but you are in my blood
you're my holy wine
You're so bitter
bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink
a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet"
All For The Love Of A Girl,47,Johnny Horton,"Well Today I'm so weary
음~~ 오늘은 제가 너무 피곤하네요

이건 모두 당신 때문이예요

Life was so sweet dear
삶은 정말 달콤했지요...
Life was a song
인생은 노래입니다.
Now you've gonna and left me
이제 당신은 날두고 가 버렸으니

Wrong Rainbow,99,Peter Yarrow,"Autumn leaves are blowing round my feet
winter wind is at my face
crulest stars are staring down
saying that I finally lost this race

Where did I learn my wanderin' ways
what was I hoping there to find
when did I realize what lay ahead
could no make up for what I'd left behind

Must have been wrong rainbow
I don't see any pot of gold
all I see is a man too old to start again

I had a girl in the summer of my youth
she loved me more and more each day
god only knows why I gave her up
for marrige to that cold cold highway

Never knew the years to go so fast
never felt my feet so slow
I bet it all on the yellow, red and blues
of a ghost I used to call my rainbow

Must have been the wrong rainbow
I don't see any pot of gold
all I see is the man too old to start again."
Here Before,117,Vashti Bunyan,"Once I had a child
He was wilder than moonlight

Like she'd been here before

Then I had a child
Took his while like northern summer
And he knows it all
Like he's been here before"

Lady, are you crying,
do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time
together was all gone
Lady, you’ve been dreaming,
I’m as close as I can be
I swear to you our time has just begun

Close your eyes and rest your weary mind
I promise I will stay right here beside you
Today our lives were joined,
became entwined
I wish you could know
how much I love you

Lady, are you happy,
do you feel the way I do
Are there meanings
that you’ve never seen before
Lady, my sweet lady,
I just can’t believe it’s true
And it’s like I’ve never ever loved before

Close your eyes and rest your weary mind
I promise I will stay right here beside you
Today our lives were joined, became entwined
I wish you could know how much I love you

Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time together was all gone

"Puff, The Magic Dragon",444,"Peter, Paul & Mary","Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea



마법의 용 퍼프는 바닷가에 살고있다네

And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalei



그리고 ""하날리""라 불리는 땅에서 가을 안개속을 뛰놀았지

Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff



꼬마 재키 페이퍼는 그런 장난꾸러기 퍼프를 사랑했고

and brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff

실과 봉랍, 그리고 다른 멋진 물건들을 가져왔다네







Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea



오, 마법의 용 퍼프는 바닷가에 살고있다네



And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalei



그리고 ""하날리""라 불리는 땅에서 가을 안개속을 뛰놀았지

Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea



마법의 용 퍼프는 바닷가에 살고있다네

And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalei



그리고 ""하날리""라 불리는 땅에서 가을 안개속을 뛰놀았지







Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sails



그들은 함께 바람에 물결치는 돛을 단 배를 타고 여행을 했네

Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail



재키는 퍼프의 거대한 꼬리에 앉아 망을 보았지

Noble kings and princess would bow when there they came



그들이 지나갈때는 고귀한 왕과 왕자들이 머리를 숙였고

Pirate ships would lower their flads when Puff roared out his name



퍼프가 자신의 이름을 포효하면 해적선은 깃발을 내렸다네









Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea



오, 마법의 용 퍼프는 바닷가에 살고있다네



And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalei



그리고 ""하날리""라 불리는 땅에서 가을 안개속을 뛰놀았지

마법의 용 퍼프는 바닷가에 살고있다네

And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalei



그리고 ""하날리""라 불리는 땅에서 가을 안개속을 뛰놀았지





A dragon lives forever but not so little boys



용은 영원히 살지만 작은 소년은 그렇지 않아

Painted wings and giants rings make way for other toys



색칠된 날개와 커다란 반지는 다른 장난감들에게 자리를 비켜 주었네

One gray night it happened



어느 회색빛 밤, 그일이 벌어졌지



Jackie Paper came no more



재키 페이퍼는 더 이상 오지 않았다네

And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar



그리고 강한 용 퍼프는 그의 겁없는 포효를 그쳤지



His head was bent in sorrow



그의 머리는 슬픔으로 떨구어 졌고

Grief scales fell like rain



슬픔으로 찬 비늘들은 비처럼 떨어졌네

Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane



퍼프는 더이상 체리나무 오솔길로 놀러가지 않았지







Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave



평생을 함께한 친구 없이는, 퍼프는 용감해 질 수가 없었네

So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave

그래서 강한 용 퍼프는 슬픔에 잠겨 그의 동굴 속으로 들어갔지







Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea



오, 마법의 용 퍼프는 바닷가에 살고있다네



And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalei



그리고 ""하날리""라 불리는 땅에서 가을 안개속을 뛰놀았지

Fallen From The Sky,"1,111",Glen Hansard,"You must've fallen from the sky
You must've shattered on the runway
You've brought so many to the light
And now you're by yourself

There comes a point in every fight
When giving up seems like the only way
When everyone one has said goodbye
And now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Some where to fall apart
The rules of cain, the rights you've made
The owls that caw, for those to blame
The broken glass, the fool that asked
The moving arrow to stop

You must've fallen from the sky
You must've come here in the pourin' rain
You took so many through the light
And now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Somewhere to fall apart

The ruins of man, the bloody black
The fool that bull the prouder hag
The night the makes the rattle ask
The wolves that follow the outed man
The falling star the way we are
The vern
The rules that never ever multiply

You must've fallen from the sky
You must've come here on the wrong way
You came among us every time
But now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Somewhere to fall apart
The call you seek, the basket case
The rules of thumb you have to break
The raging skull, The rag to the bull
The nails that drag in either hand
Well I will make my worker that
I know this place
I know this time

You must've fallen from the sky"

For lovers never can be friends

Thru the years your love will haunt me
And I'll dream about your charms
Still I know you'll never want me
Your a stranger in my arms

Ev'ry story has an ending
This is where our story ends
Please don't hurt me by pretending
For lovers never can be friends

Thru the years your love will haunt me
And I'll dream about your charms
Still I know you'll never want me
Your a stranger in my arms

Your a stranger in my arms"
Mr. Tambourine Man,140,Bob Dylan,"Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Though you might hear laughin', spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing

Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you"
Wild Fire,454,Laura Marling,"Chasing down a wild fire
Are you trying to make a cold
liar out of me
You wanna get high
You overcome those desires
before you come to me
I think your mama's kinda sad
And your papa's kinda mean
I can take that all away
You can stop playing it out on me
Me me
She keeps a pen behind her ear
In case she's got something
she really
really needs to say
She puts it in a notepad
She's gonna write a book someday
Of course the only part
that I want to read
Is about her time spent with me
Wouldn't you die to know
how you're seen
Are you getting away with
who you're trying to be
Trying trying to be
Of course
there's things upon the Earth
That we must really try to defend
A lonely beast a kind heart
Something weak and on trend
I'd do it all for her for free
I need nothing back for me
There no sweeter deed may be
Than to love something enough to
wanna help it get free
Free free
Is there something on her mind
Something she needs to get by
Do you cry sometimes
Do you cry sometimes
You always say you love me most
When I don't know I'm being seen
Well maybe someday
when God takes me away
I'll understand
what the fuck that means
I just know your mama's kinda sad
And your papa's kinda mean
I can take it all away
You can stop playing
that shit out on me
Me me
Is there something on your mind
Something you need to get by
Do you cry sometimes
Do you cry sometimes
I know your mama's kinda sad
I know your papa's kinda mean
I would take it all away

Running from the start

somebody else's heart

Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath
out of my lungs
Can't even fight it

"Forever Young, Forever Beautiful",284,Jens Lekman,"In Milwaukee
I met a mountaineer
He told me how he'd taken
an old lady from there
To one of those famous
mountaintops
Where her husband once
had perished and dropped
Being a gymnast
she was in very good shape
But once in a while they
had to stop for a break
To warm their hands
on a cup of java
As he helped her put
on her balaclava
It'd been forty-two years
he had heard
But the man's body was
quite well preserved
From the permanent cold he was
Forever young forever beautiful
Forever young forever beautiful
Forever young
On the way down
her cheeks were redder
Redder than the reddest apple
They set up their tent at base camp
Crawled into their sleeping bags
And she lit a candle
She said
You should have seen
him in his summer clothes
The short pants
that gently exposed
His calves that spoke
of hidden treasures
Golden ratios unknown pleasures
She told him how their
bodies had together bloomed
The first time they did it
in her student room
How she had got on top of him
So she could see everything
Reflecting the light off the moon
Forever young forever beautiful
Forever young forever beautiful
Forever young"

You circle the squares

You circle the squares
If I die and I come back to life,
drop me there in the stare
I've been missin'
All the time ticking past
since I last saw her dance,
maybe that time was nothing
She knows
it's the only way to breathe
Packed tight

For one or two lifetimes

Oh we’re all just trying
to make it out alive

living outta no suitcase
Singing alone
selling my heartbreak
At least right here
I’m living my way
And all the rest
I’ll gladly leave behind

Don’t know how to fight this, I’m not really like this
When you're not around

Wondering for the rest of my life

Lucky that you found it

I should never fight it, I’m not really like this
When I just admit
That I’m not easy to myself

Waiting Room,18,Asgeir,"I was away when I heard
The news
My brother called me up
From the damned waiting room
I got a ticket to ride
Back home
My mind was racing
In fear of the unknown

I saw a dry barren land
All looked so lifeless and bland
On my way
Wait up before you cross the lake

Down by the ocean we hoped
To build a house
Tune into the sound of waves
And watch the sun go down
Riding along the open road
In a haze
It only took hours
But felt like many days

I saw a dry barren land
All looked so lifeless and bland
The road into town seemed so long
The bird's sang a sad sad song
On my way
Wait up before you cross the lake"

Therе's a man in a black coat standing at a crossroads
With a pad in his hand and a long list of lost souls
They say he flips a coin forged out of fool's gold

Singing, Oh, when they call me home
Singing, Oh, when they call me home
I'm gonna ride the lightning"
I'm Just Different,42,Joshua Radin,"I've been looking through the windows
Standin' out here in the cold
But I will never want what they've got
Though the world will tell me so

[Pre-Chorus]
They can keep saying
They know the way
But there's a light inside us
They'll see some day
But they can keep thinkin'
They'll pull us in
But there's a new wave comin'
We're ready to begin

[Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe you're like me
We're so much more than anyone can see

[Verse 2]
We'll find our way, we use the moonlight
Punished by the lonely dawn
We see the wisdom in the quiet
We knew the answers all along

[Pre-Chorus]
But they can keep saying
They know the way
But there's a light inside us
They'll see some day
And they can keep thinkin'
They'll pull us in
But there's a new wave comin'
We're ready to begin

[Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe you're like me
We're so much more than anyone can see

[Bridge]
We find a happiness in ordinary days
We don't need the things that shine
I'll sit beside you while the birds begin to sing
Reminding us that they're alive
It's just enough to be alive

[Chorus]
So I don't care what they say
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe you're like me
We're so much more than anyone can see
I don't care (I don't care)
What they say (What they say)
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe (And maybe)
You're like me (You're like me)
We're so much more than anyone can see
We got 'em thinkin'"
Touch And Go,36,Adam Melchor,"sometimes you just have to figure out
to take your life at 17 and turn it upside down
and all the walls you build don’t make a house
with a heavy heart you make it work it somehow

i learned to love
the touch and go
the let it ride
the take it slow and I know
it’s a miracle
to let the tears run with a smile
and let it last a little while and i know it seems trivial
sometimes the best plans fall out of your hands
i loosen up on what i hold
and now i love the touch and go

sometimes you have nothing left to give
you wish that you could take it back to ignorance is bliss
and while the water flows under the bridge
you think of all the time you lost
with all the love you missed

i learned to love
the touch and go
the let it ride
the take it slow and I know
it’s a miracle
to let the tears run with a smile
and let it last a little while and i know it seems trivial
sometimes the best plans fall out of your hands
i loosen up on what i hold
and now i love the touch and go

i learned to love
the touch and go
the let it ride
the take it slow and I know
it’s a miracle
to let the tears run with a smile
and let it last a little while and i know it seems trivial
sometimes the best plans fall out of your hands
i loosen up on what i hold
and now i love the touch and go
i loosen up on what i hold
and now i love the touch and go"
Let Me Know When (feat. Fleet Foxes),14,Adam Melchor,"All the dominos are falling
in the way you always
told me that they could
you get sick of things so easy
then you wind up leaving
and you’re gone for good
you say your fine
and that’s all right
i’ve learned to love
the little ways you lie
let me know when
you fall out of love with me
so it won’t hurt so bad
when you leave
at least then i’ll expect it
i’ll tell my heart accept it
when you fall out of love with me
all the promises of calling
start to feel like
if you wanted to you would
i get every message sent to me
i can read the room
youre understood
you say your fine
and that’s all right
i’ve learned to love
the little ways you lie
let me know when
you fall out of love with me
so it won’t hurt so bad
when you leave
at least then i’ll expect it
i’ll tell my heart accept it
when you fall out of love with me
let me know
when you fall out of love with me"

ready now (acoustic),10,Amistat,"I found myself among the wolves
I couldn't fight them
I found myself among the fools
I couldn't hide, I couldn't from them

I sought a way to set things right
Listened to my own advice
I found a light out in the night
And then I realized

Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now

I have done wrong that may be right
I won't fight that
I've set things wrong when they were right
I won't hide that

I might be numb but still alive
Waiting for the morning light
My fears and pain seem to have died
I've come to realize

Hеy love I'm ready now
Hey lovе I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now

I sought the way to set things right
I found a light out in the night
I might be numb but still alive

Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now"

from raising the bar
getting disappointed
know this place from inside
i could be the tour guide i know
that’s it’s pointless but i
try, i’ll try, anything i can
just to remind myself that
not good’s not so bad
oh i’m in a mess
i get sentimental when
things go worse to bad
then they get worse again (but)
i’m taking my first step
i’m rejecting perfect now
gotta stop the hate (hey)
hating on okay
okay’s a belief
it’s even a privilege
and anyway happy
is so overrated
comes and goes whenever
okay’s always there to rely on

Wide Open Light,0,Ben Harper,"I know what it's like to be half dead
And the other half gone out of your head
Time is only mercy
Time, give me time
It's in everything
We all must leave behind
If tomorrow starts today
We'd best be on our way
There's no time to waste
Only you'll restore my faith
Mistakes I am destined to repeat
'til I get them right
Walk with me into the wide open light
Walk with me into the wide open light
The wide open light
You looked at me and
my skin jumped from my bones
I knew I would never be alone
Bring me your days dust
And if you're staying here,
you'll be staying with me, I trust
If tomorrow starts today
We'd best be on our way
There's no time to waste
Only you'll restore my faith
Mistakes I'm destined to repeat
'til I get them right
Walk with me into the wide open light
Walk with me into the wide open light
The wide open light
Silence always picks up where it left off
Silence always picks up where it left off
If tomorrow starts today
We'd best be on our way
There's no time to waste
Only you'll restore my faith
Mistakes I am destined to repeat
'til I get them right
Walk with me into the wide open light
Walk with me into the wide open light
The wide open light
The wide open light

Dinner with Friends,9,Kacey Musgraves,"Dinner with friends
In cities where none of us live
The face that somebody makes
When you give 'em a gift
Every once in a while
When I wake up early without trying
And catch a sunrise

The feeling you feel when you're looking at something you made
The layers and ruffles in my favorite pink-champagne cake
My home state of Texas
The sky there and horses and dogs
But none of their laws

The shape of his eyes
The shape of his nose
The cute way he mispronounces certain words
The smell of his clothes
The things I would miss from the other side

Intimate convos that go way into the night
The way that the sun on my floor makes a pattern of light
And early in June when the fireflies first start to glow
It never gets old

The shape of his heart
My shoes by his door
He loves me in all of the ways that I've never felt love before
Things I would miss
From the other side"

Promises,62,Eric Clapton,"I don't care if you never come home,
I don't mind if you just keep on
Rowing away on a distant sea,
'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me.

You cause a commotion when you come to town;
You give 'em a smile and they melt.
Having lovers and friends is all good and fine,
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine.
La la, la la la la la.
La la, la la la la la.

I don't care what you do at night,
Oh, and I don't care how you get your delights.
I'm gonna leave you alone, I'll just let it be,
I don't love you and you don't love me.
I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate.
We made a vow we'd always be friends.
How could we know that promises end?
La la, la la la la la.
La la, la la la la la.

I tried to love you for years upon years,
You refuse to take me for real.
It's time you saw what I want you to see,
And I'd still love you if you'd just love me.
I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate.

Love Me,189,The Little Willies,"Treat me like a fool,

But love me.
Wring my faithful heart,
Tear it all apart,
But love me.
If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' so close to mine

Crying over you, dear only.

Shelter,379,Ray LaMontagne,"I guess you don't need it
I guess you don't want me
to repeat it
But everyting
I have to give l'll give to you
It's not like we planned it
You tried to stay
but you could not stand it
To see me shut down slow
as though it was
an easy thing to do
Listen when
All of this around us'll fall over
I tell you what we're gonna do
You will shelter me my love
And i will shelter you
I will shelter you
I left you heartbroken
but not until those
very words were spoken
Has anybody ever made
such a fool out of you
It's hard to believe it
Even as my eyes do see it
The very things
that make you live are killing you
Listen when all of this
around us'll fall over
I tell you what we're gonna do
You will shelter me my love
I will shelter you
I will shelter you
I will shelter you
I will shelter you
I will shelter you
Listen when
All of this around us'll fall over
I tell you what we're gonna do
Hey you will shelter me my love
I will shelter you
If you shelter me too
I will shelter you
I will shelter you"
The Road Back Home,55,Doyle Dykes,"I'm stranded since I've landed
Always unknown
A riddle now stalks me
I guess I'm on my own
Betray those beliefs
And lose that grin
Don't be yourself, that's a sin
I'll look deep inside
Find my soul
Where's my road
The road back home
Hang in there that's what they say
Since I left my home
But choose now, choose wisely
The mysteries that roam
Betray those beliefs
And lose that grin
Don't be yourself, that's a sin
I'll look deep inside
Find my soul
Where's my road
The road back home
They said You're always a zero
They said You'll never be a hero
I can't find te words tonight
Get ready for the news, boy
Welcome to the real life!
Betray those beliefs
And lose that grin
Don't be yourself, that's a sin
I'll look deep inside
Find my soul
Where's my road
The road back home!"
Pride And Joy,328,Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble,"Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind

she's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



Yeah I love my baby, my heart and soul

love like ours won't never grow old

she's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

she's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



Yeah I love my baby to belong and lean

you mess with her, you'll see a man gettin' mean

she's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

she's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy

Well I love my baby like the finest wine

Stick with her until the end of time

she's my sweet little thing, she's my pride amd joy

she's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



Yeah I love my baby, my heart and soul

love like ours will never grow old

she's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

she's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy"
How Low,357,José González,"How low are you willing to go
Before you reach all your selfish goals
Punch line after punch line
Leaving us sore, leaving us sore

Absorbed in your ill hustling
Feeding a monster, just feeding a monster
Invasion after invasion
This means war, this means war

Someday you'll be up to your knees
In the shit you see
All the gullible that you mislead
Won't be up or it

Where to, will you relocate
Now that it's war, now that it's war"
Fifteen,918,Taylor Swift,"You take a deep breath
and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your
very first day
You say hi to your friends
you ain't seen in a while
Try to stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year
and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this
town Hoping one of those senior
boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around
before Cause when you're fifteen
and Somebody tells you they love
you You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling
like There's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know
Who you're gonna be At fifteen

You sit in class next to
a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls
who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon
as we can And then you're on
your very first date And he's
got a car and you're feeling like
flying And your mama's waiting up
and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancing round your
room when the night ends
When the night ends
Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen
and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around but
In your life you'll do things
greater than Dating the boy
on the football team
but I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be
wanted Wish you could go back
and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore
I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger
dreams of mine And Abigail gave
everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind
And we both cried
Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most
anything And you just might
find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who
I was supposed to be at fifteen

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you
walk through the doors"
When I Dream,"1,000",M.Y.M.P,"I could build a mansion
that is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts
I want and never ask please
I could fly to Paris
it's at my beck and call
Why do I live my life alone
with nothing at all
But when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come true
when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come true
I can be the singer
or the clown in any room
I can call up someone
to take me to the moon
I can put my make-up on
and drive a man insane
I can go to bed alone
and never know his name
But when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come true
when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come true"

If The Moon Fell Down (Album Version) (Feat. Colbie Caillat),396,Chase Coy,"Everythime I see your smile
It makes my heart beat fast
And know It's much too soon to tell
I'm hoping this will last
Cuz I just always wanna have you
right here by my side
The future is near but never certain
So please stay here for just tonight
I must a done something right
To deserve you in my life
I must a done something right
Along the way

I just can't get you off my mind
And why would I even try
Cuz even when I close my eyes
I dream about you all the time
I just always wanna have you
right here by my side
The future is near but never certain
At least stay here for just tonight
I musta done something right
To deserve you in my life
I must a done something right
Along the way
And even if
the moon fell down tonight
There would be nothing
To worry about at all
Because you
make the whole world shine
As long as you are here everything
will be alright

I must a done something right
To deserve you in my life
I must a done something right
Along the way"
Innocent,870,Taylor Swift,"I guess you really did it
this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to
get it back
Wasn't it easier in your
lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful
when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you
It's all right just wait and see
Your string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've been
You're still an innocent

You're still an innocent

There's some things
you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live
it all again
You wouldn't be shattered
on the floor now
If only you would sing
what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your
firefly catchin' days
And everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down
to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin'
wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up
to you
It's all right
just wait and see
Your string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never to late to
Be brand new

It's all right
just wait and see
Your string of lights are still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost never to like to
get it back"
Mine,707,Taylor Swift,"You were in college workin'
part time waitin' tables
Left a small town
never looked back
I was a flight risk
with a fear of fallin'
Wonderin' why we bother
with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
You remember
we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin'
on the world together
And there's a drawer of my
things at your place
You learn my secrets and
you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make
my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is
what I thought about
You remember we were
sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city
lights on the water
You saw me start to believe
for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine
Oh oh oh
And I remember that fight
2 30 am
You said Everything was
slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you
followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone
You said
I remember how we felt
sittin' by the water
And everytime I look at you
it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless
man's careful daughter
She is the best thing
that's ever been mine
Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless
man's careful daughter
You are the best thing
that's ever been mine
Yeah do you believe it
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now"

I just go on and on
No one's gonna
take him away from me
Everyday and everynight
I just wanna hold him tight
and make sure
that everything stays right
and everyday and everynight

my delight and know that
he'll stay with me all the way
He's my only one

Oats We Sow,340,Gregory And The Hawk,"Some day I'll toss
all your presents
and bury the letters
left unsent
cause It's bad to do
what's easy
just cause
It's easy and I wanna do
what pleases me but I can't
and the rode she'd rode
around the side of the mountain
with nowhere to go
but the heart
we'd known when
It's leaning and
It's creeping toward being alone
some day I'll find
the mind to mend it
and make dry
these eyes have gotten wet
cause It's bad to do
what's easy just cause
It's easy and I wanna do
what pleases me
but I can't oh no no
and the crow he'd know
Half the grass and no with
nowhere to go
but the heart
we'd know when It's loving
It's leaving towards being alone
and the oats we sow
they can seed on
forever with nowhere to grow
but the heart
we'd know when
It's asking It's exact way
to go to not be alone"
The Memory Is Cruel,399,Russian Red,"She's not coming home tonight
she says that she's left forever
And you're staying in the house
where she's going to live forever
And the memory’s cruel
it reminds there's no one new
time is nothing but a lie
if she's not coming home tonight
And your sleep will never be
as good as it used to be
when the one you love is gone
when the one you love is gone
While you're waiting for the sun
the space around you is very quiet
So you breath in close your eyes
you can feel her warmth
inviting you to dance
she's cruel she reminds
there's no one new
time is nothing but a lie
if she's not coming home tonight
And your sleep will never be
as good as it used to be
when the one you love is gone
when the one you love is gone"
Superman,"1,106",M.Y.M.P,"I can't stand to fly

The better part of me

than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face
beside a train
And it's not easy to be me
I wish that i could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'bout a home i'll never see
It may sound absurd
but don't be naive
Even heroes have
the right to bleed
I may be disturbed
but won't you concede
Even heroes have
the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me
Up up and away away from me
Well it's all right
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees
I'm only a girl in a
silly red sheet
Digging for kryptonite on this
one way street
Only a girl in a funny red sheet
Looking for special
things inside of me
Inside of me inside of me yeah
Inside of me inside of me
I'm only a girl in a
funny red sheet
I'm only a girl looking for a dream
I'm only a girl in a
funny red sheet
And it's not easy
it's not easy to be me"

Requiem On Water,652,Imperial Mammoth,"Slowly paddle through the lake
Straight to the very center
Of the darkest water
Where we can embrace
the shadows on the surface
The eyes that look up lifeless
From our twins below
And though your arms
and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost in plunder
My love will be there still
True its chilling to behold
Up close we stumble backwards
Laughing in our boats till
The image sinks away
to someplace far for certain
A land of new suspension
Where someday we must go
And though your arms
and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost is plunder
My love will be there still
And though your arms
and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost is plunder
My love will be there still"
Going Up The Country (2005 Digital Remaster),16,Canned Heat,"I'm going up the country babe don't you wanna go
I'm going up the country babe don't you wanna go
I'm going to some place where I've never been before
I'm going I'm going where the water tastes like wine
Well I'm going where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water stay drunk all the time
I'm gonna leave this city got to get away
I'm gonna leave this city got to get away
All this fussing and fighting man

Now baby pack your leaving trunk you know

Just exactly where we're going

that I want to play
No use of you running or screaming and crying
'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine"
Night Bus,494,Lucy Rose,"And you see trouble in her eyes
And you've noticed but only realized
It's not fading however hard you try
'cause it's built in her for all her life
I'm not alone
She said I'm not alone
And she takes the night bus home
She's not phased by the darkness in her soul
And you barely catch a glimpse of her
'cause she's wrapped tightly hiding in her clothes
I'm not alone
She said I'm not alone
She said I'm not alone
And they're strangers and they're walking my way
and I'm talking to myself
Strangers and they're walking my way
and I'm talking to myself

Climb Up The Ladder,4,Jaymay,"Climb up the ladder
we found by the lake by mistake
does it really even matter
how we fall
if we all break in the fall I
shake like leaves
before they fall and land by the
lake
where kids climb down the ladder
we found by mistake
it doesn't matter how we fall if
we all break"
Small Bump,515,Ed Sheeran,"You're just a small bump unborn, in four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months you're brought to life
I'll whisper quietly, I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly, I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why"
Think Of You (Duet with Cassadee Pope),438,Chris Young,"[Verse 1: Chris Young]
I walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?

[Verse 2: Cassadee Pope]
Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same

[Chorus: Both]
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Verse 3: Chris Young & Both]
They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times

[Chorus: Both]
We were to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Bridge: Chris Young & Cassadee Pope]
Ain't it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa, when they think of you]
It can burn when it's in the past

[Chorus: Both]
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Outro: Both]
Oh, they think of you
When they think of me
Baby, baby, oh
When they think of me, they think of you"

Charlie,97,Alex Siegel,"If I had to summarize You brought something more to life
Winter spring and summer fall
Happy every time I call
Then time gets in the way
And turns the body strange
You didn't know my face
When I saw you yesterday

Goodbye is really hard to say
I know you'll always stay
Sleeping in my arms

I just can't believe you're really gone
I know you could never be alone
There's no way to change what's meant to be
But show them everything you showed to me

We were just passing time
Watching the world go by
Those sleepy eyes
Really got a hold on me
In the morning light
Forget the world outside
Please don't give up the fight
You still got so much to see

Goodbye is really hard to say
I know you'll always stay
Sleeping in my arms

I just can't believe you're really gone
I know you could never be alone
There's no way to change what's meant to be
But show them everything you showed to me

Show them everything you showed to me
I just can't believe you're really gone
I know you could never be alone
There's no way to change what's meant to be Goodbye is really hard to say
But show them everything you showed to me I know you'll always stay sleeping in my arms"
Butterflies,19,Plastic Plastic,"Being with you is easy
Like two butterflies flying in harmony
Nothing surprising or extraordinary
Like listening to the same old favorite song repeatedly

Being with you I feel calm
Just Like the sound of birds are singing an alarm
It's the soft touch I'm embracing in my arms
during the fading of the bustling day
with no time

We are as far as the stars and the earth
But I feel the love that lives within me

You are there, I am here
Not in the same place but we share the atmosphere
When our souls share, then all fear disappears
Never feel alone from here, being with you is real
being with you is real

With the feelings that no one masters
Like the fire dancing in the water
Swaying together

You are there, I am here
Not in the same place but we share the atmosphere
When our souls share, then all fear disappears
Never feel alone from here, being with you is real
being with you is real
being with you is real"

And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen

Tourniquet,15,Zach Bryan,"There’s delays on the planes out of eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leaving from
You’ve been stabbed in your back and the rest of your body
Won’t you tell me where you’re bleeding from
If you need a tourniquet or if you want to turn and quit
Know that I’ll be by your side
You bled your whole soul into things you can’t control
In a world you’ll never satisfy

I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughing last week at something I dreamed of

When you finally feel the blood you spill into everybody else
I’ll tourniquet your toes to the ground
Pull you in and hold you tight love you through the heart of night
Spring your kind ass into town
You’ve been playing your guitar from arenas to the bars
Since you were old enough to rhyme a word
But your face is getting thinner and you’re praying for the winter
and I heard you fucked it up with her

I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughing last evening at something I dreamed of

I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does

Bigger Houses,14,Dan + Shay,"Used to dream about buying that bigger house,
sitting on top of some hill
Losing sleep about filling my bank account,
wondering if I ever will

But the older I get, I just care less and less
'bout keeping up with people named Jones
If you don't fill it up with somebody that you love,
it ain't ever gonna feel like home

There's always gonna be a higher high
You could chase for the rest of your life
Greener grass in the yard next door
Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an empty cup
if what you got's still not enough
The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

I can hear the kids making little footsteps,
running down the hallway upstairs
I can see the dogs playing in the back yard,
through the kitchen window right there

Maybe life's kinda more 'bout a swing on the porch,
holding her while the sun disappears
Why would I wanna be anywhere else in the world
when my whole world is sitting right here?

There's always gonna be a higher high
You could chase for the rest of your life
Greener grass in the yard next door
Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an empty cup
if what you got's still not enough
The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

No-no, no-no, no-no

There's always gonna be a higher high
You could chase for the rest of your life
Greener grass in the yard next door
Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an empty cup
if what you got's still not enough
The thing about happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger houses

Still Got The Blues,801,Gary Moore,"Used to be so easy
to give my heart away
But I found that the hard way
Was a price you have to pay
But I found that then love
was no friend of mine
I should've known time after time
So long it was so long ago
But I've
still got the blues for you

Used to be so easy
to fall in love again
But I found that the hard way
It's a role that leads to pain
I found that love
was more than just a game
To play and to win
but to lose just the same
So long it was so long ago
But I've
still got the blues for you
So many years
since I've seen your face
But you're in my heart
There's an empty space
you used to be

So long it was so long ago
But I've
still got the blues for you
Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you"
Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain,112,Willie Nelson,"In the twilight glow I see you
이글거리는 황혼녘에서 난 그대를 바라봅니다
Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 우는 그대의 슬픈 눈동자
As we kissed goodbye and parted
우리가 작별의 키스를 하고 떠날 때
I knew we'd never meet again
난 우리가 결코 다시는 못 만날거라는 걸 알았지요
Love is like a dying ember
사랑은 죽어가는 장작불 같아요
Only memories remain
단지 추억만 남아 있을 뿐
Through the ages I'll remember
비록 시간이 지난다해도 난 기억할 겁니다
Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 울던 그대의 슬픈 눈동자를

Now my hair has turned to silver
이제 나의 머리는 은빛으로 변했고
All my life I've loved in vain
나의 모든 삶에서 난 헛되이 사랑을 했나봐요
I can see her star in heaven
난 천국에 있는 그녀의 별을 볼 수 있어요

Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 울던 그대의 슬픈 눈동자를
Someday when we meet up yonder
언젠가는 우리가 천국에서 만나겠지요
We'll stroll hand in hand again
우린 다시 손을 잡고 산책을 할 수 있을거예요
In a land that knows no parting
이별이 없는 그 영원한 세계에서
Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 울던 그대의 슬픈 눈동자"
Not Ready To Make Nice,485,The Chicks,"Forgive, sounds good

Forget, I’m not sure I could

They say time heals everything

But I’m still waiting

I’m through with doubt

There’s nothing left for me to figure out

I’ve paid a price

And I’ll keep paying

I’m not ready to make nice

I’m not ready to back down

I’m still mad as hell and

I don’t have time to

go round and round and round

It’s too late to make it right

I probably wouldn’t if I could

‘Cause I’m mad as hell

Can’t bring myself to do

what it is you think I should

I know you said

Can’t you just get over it

It turned my whole world around

And I kind of like it

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby

With no regrets and I don’t mind saying

It’s a sad sad story

when a mother will teach her daughter

that she ought to hate a perfect stranger

And how in the world can the words that I said

Send somebody so over the edge

That they’d write me a letter

Sayin’ that I better shut up and sing

Or my life will be over"
Kathy's Song,73,Eva Cassidy,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

My mind's distracted and confused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
Kiss you when you start the day

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There before the grace of you go I"

You smile and say how are you

I watched superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
To save the world
I'll be around
I watched superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Talk dark and beautiful
He's complicated
he's irrational
But I hope someday
you take me away
and save the day yeah
Something in his deep browns eyes
has me sing
Hes not all bad like his reputation
I can't hear one single
word they said no
You really got places to be
and I'll be old then
I always forget to tell you
I love you I loved you
from the very first day
I watched superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
To save the world I'll be around
I watched superman fly away
Come back ill deal with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly
around the world
And I hope you
don't chase some other girl
don't forget don't forget about me
I'm far away but
I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking
out the window
Don't forget don't forget
where I'll be
Right here wishing the
flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the card was from you
Cause I loved you from the
very first day
I watched superman fly away
You've got a busy day
today to save the world
Ill be around forever
and ever here
I watched superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

When you come back down"
Broken,"1,091",Jake Bugg,"I wait here for you 'fore I'm broken down
I'm coming down
This time
'fore my heart bleeds
Far and away where they took you down
I lead them over to your house
Where I'm broken
Down by the people if they let you breath
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Still my heart beats for you
Have become
All I love and all I hoped for
But I must carry on
Always one
Never broken
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Whoa
I am one
I am one
Break story of
peace and love
In a future
Pride sacrifice
Came around
Never broken
Down by the people if they let you breath
Don't give a damn if you still cant see
Traveling down a street that I did not go
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Whoa
I am one
Whoa
I am one
I am one"

Jingle Bell Rock,100,Wayne Newton,"Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

[Verse 3]
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

[Verse 4]
(Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock)

Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond Of Each Other,1,Orville Peck,"Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men

And I believe to my soul that inside every man, there's the feminine
And inside every lady, there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out

And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy, don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other

What do you think all them saddles and boots was about?

And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother

And inside every lady, there's a cowboy that wants to come out

And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out"

Time On My Hands,68,Asgeir,"On the lawn
under the garden wall at home
I heard about palmistry
When the girls
arrived pretending to be seers
Who could tell my destiny
Twenty years now down the road
I'm there again
and see some things have changed
While others stay the same
When I read between the lines
Beyond the fickle finger
of my fate
Time is on my hands
They informed me
that my lifeline was short
And for sure I'd be going soon
Didn't want to die
before I'd reached my teens
So I cried all afternoon
Twenty years now down the road
I'm there again
and see some things have changed
While others stay the same
When I read between the lines
Beyond the fickle finger
of my fate
Time is on my hands"

Snow Globe (Feat. Marle Thomson),20,Anthony Lazaro,"You walk into the room
People can't help it
They're staring at you
Frozen in place
Cause they have never seen
A woman who shines like a queen
And I can't believe
This stunning creature is dancing with me
Maybe I'm dreaming but what do I care
As long as the dream is still there
So why are you hanging around someone like me
Nowhere near perfect and I'll never be
I can be trouble and I change moods like
Tides of the sea
But if you feel like sticking around
I'll wrap us up in a globe of this town
And let the snow fall, while I'm kissing you
And look at those eyes
Bright as two stars fallen down from the sky
Two perfect hands softly gliding around
A tender voice floating in sound
So why are you hanging with someone like me
Nowhere near perfect and I'll never be
I can be trouble and I change moods like
Tides of the sea
But if you're feeling like sticking around
I'll wrap us up in a globe of this town
And let the snow fall, while I'm kissing you"
Hummingbird (Feat. Marle Thomson),30,Anthony Lazaro,"If you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
Then you feel it once again
When your worries fill the air
You look outside your window
And there's a hundred shades of gray out there
But that's the moment I come in
With just another silly song
Here to remind you once again
That not everything is wrong
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
Just for you
Sometimes a day might seem so long
So make it shorter with this song
We'll make the hours dance away like a night at the ballet
Why'd you walk when you can dance around
You hear this tune all through the town
And the birds in the trees
Will be whistling its melody
Whistle its melody
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
For you
For you
For you
I'll be singing just for you
For you
And you you
You you you
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
Just for you
There's a hummingbird singing just for you
For you"

Where It Ends,5,Bailey Zimmerman,"This is where it ends
I been down a few broken roads that I'm tryin' to mend
But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down

[Pre-Chorus]
Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pridе to let that happen again
So this is wherе it ends

[Verse 2]
Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I shoulda walked out that door

[Pre-Chorus]
Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends, ends, ends
Yeah, this is where it ends

[Bridge]
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
You showed me what true love shouldn't be
I found myself the second I gave up on us

[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance (Second chance)
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends"

Please Come Home For Christmas,32,Koe Wetzel,"Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, and I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

And choirs will be singing Silent Night
And Christmas carols by candlelight
Please, come home for Christmas
(please, come home)
Please, come home for Christmas
(please, come home)
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear
Some time of year to be with the one you love

So won't you tell me,
you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow (no more sorrow)
No grief and pain (grief or pain)
And I'll be happy, happy once again
Come on home now

Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow
(no more sorrow)
And no grief and pain (grief or pain)

Riding with the King,236,Eric Clapton,"I dreamed I had a good job
and I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade
A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll
No pretty chick is
gonna make me crawl

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman child and man
Gets a Cadillac
and a great big diamond ring
Don't you know
you're riding with the king

He's on a mission of mercy
to the new frontier
He's gonna check us
all on out of here
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your
prescription filled

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody clap your hands
And don't you just love the
way that he sings
Don't you know
we're riding with the king
Riding with the king
Don't you know
we're riding with the king

A tuxedo and shiny 335

You can see it in his face
the blue never lie
Tonight everybody's getting
their angel wings
And don't you know
we're riding with the king
I stepped out of Mississippi
when I was ten years old
With a suit cut sharp
as a razor and a heart made of gold
I had a guitar hanging
just about waist high
And I'm gonna play this thing
until the day I die

Don't you know
we're riding with the king

Don't you know
we're riding with the king

Riding you're riding with the king

You're riding
you're riding with the king
riding with the king
Don't you know
we're riding with the king"

It feels like a movie I've already seen
So right now I'm beggin' you, please

Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
Give that heartache to somebody else
If you're the kinda girl
that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby

Now the closer I get to the red on your lips
I can feel myself fallin' all crazy
'Cause just a little kiss
and I could never get you out of my mind
So before you go wreck my whole life

Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
(Save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody else
(Somebody else)
If you're the kinda girl
that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby

Oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I know you know that I ain't strong enough
To tell girls like you no, no it ain't in my blood

So just save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
(Save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody else
(Somebody else)
If you're the kinda girl
that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby"
Chuck E.'s In Love,101,Rickie Lee Jones,"How come he don't come and P.I.P. with me
Down at the meter no more?
And how come he turn(ed) off the t.v.
And hang(ed) that sign on the door?
Well we call and we call ""How come?"" we say
Hey what could make a boy behave this-a way, yeah?
And he learn(ed) all of the lines, now, and every time
He gonna s-stutter when he talks
And it's true! It's true! He sure has acquired this kinda cool and inspired sorta jazz when he walk(s)
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans,
If this ain't healthy it is some kinda clean

That means Chuck E's in love

I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something I got to see. Is he here?
I look in the poolhall. Is he here?
I look in the drugstore. Is he here?
No, he don't come here no more

Well I'll tell you what, I saw him
He was sittin' behind us down at the Pantages
And whatever is that he's got up his sleeve
I hope it isn't contagious
What's her name? Is that her there?
Oh Christ, I think he's even combed his hair!
And is that her? Well then what's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be same.
That's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck E's in love with the little girl singing this song
Don't you know
Chuck E's in love, Chuck E's in love
Chuck E's in love, Chuck E's in love ...
Chuck E's in love with me"
Caramel,324,Suzanne Vega,"It won't do
To dream of caramel,
To think of cinnamon
And long for you.
It won't do
To stir a deep desire,
To fan a hidden fire
That can never burn true.
I know your name,
I know your skin,
I know the way
These things begin;
But I don't know
How I would live with myself,
What I'd forgive of myself
If you don't go.
So goodbye,
Sweet appetite
No single bite
could satisfy...
I know your name,
I know your skin,
I know the way
These things begin;
But I don't know
How I would live with myself
What I would give of myself,
If you don't go.
It won't do
To dream of caramel,
To think of cinnamon
And long for you."
Sound of Silence,155,Simon & Garfunkel,"hello,darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
because a vision softly creeping
I left the seeds while
I was sleeping,
and the vision that was
planted in my brain
still remains with in the
sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
narrow streets of cobble stone
neath the halo of a street lamp
turned my collar to the
cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
the flash of a neon
light
split the night and touched
the sound of
silence
And in the naked light,I saw
ten thousand people maybe more
people talking without speaking
people hearing without listening
people writing songs that
voices never share
no one dare disturb the sound
of silence
Fools said I you do not know
SILENCE LIKE CANCER GROW
hear my words that
i might teach you
take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words like silent
raindrops fell

and echoed in the walls of silence
and the people bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
and the sign flached out
it's warning
In the words that it was forming
and the signs said
the words of the prophets
are written on the
subway walls
and tenement halls
and whisper'd in the sound of silence"
Lonelily,880,Damien Rice,"I gave me away
I could have knocked off the
evening
But a lonelily landed my walls
in her hands
In a way I felt you were leaving
me
I was sure I wouldn't find you
at home
And you let me down
Could have knocked off the evening
But you lonelily let him push
under your bone
You let me down
It's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone
You're coming home
You're coming home
You're coming home
You're coming home
I gave me away
I could have knocked off the
evening
But I was lonelily looking for
someone to hold
In a way I lost all I believed in
And I never found myself so low
And you let me down
You could've called if you'd
needed
But you lonelily got yourself
locked instead
And you let me down
It's one thing being cheated
But you took him all the way
through your bed
And now you're coming home
And I'm trying to forgive
You're coming home
And I'm trying to forget
You're coming home
And I'm trying to move on
You're coming home
And you haven't called yet
You're coming home
And I'm trying to forgive
You're coming home
I'm just trying to forget
You're coming home
I'm trying to move on
You're coming home
But you haven't called
You're coming home
You're coming home
You're coming home
You're coming home
I gave me away
I could have knocked off the
evening
But I lonelily loomed her into
my bone
You let me down
There's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone"

I finally know
there is no end to the good

love is everywhere i go

Tomorrow Morning,571,Jack Johnson,"Will that's all right if that's all right
Two thousand miles but that's all right
And that's all right if that's all right
I'll see you in the morning if that's all right
What would you do if I wrote you a song
would you give me some loving
when I get home
or would you be mad at me if I had a hard time
getting a hold of you, I try all the time
I'll bet that you don't know anybody
that could be so bad
but if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes
- 간 주 중 -
What would you do if I sang you this song
the connection is bad
but that's only the phone
when my words kiss your ear,
I'll be right there
the message is long because
baby this is your song
I'll bet that you don't know anybody
that could be so bad
but if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
I'll be home when tomorrow morning
I'll bet that you don't know anybody
that could be so bad
but if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
I'll be home when tomorrow morning
if that's all right
I'll be home when tomorrow morning
if that's all right
I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes"
Tonight I Wanna Cry,870,Keith Urban,"Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned
down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and
I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could
have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away

I've never been the kind
to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong
meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes Tonight I wanna cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me
hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old
yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way -"
I Hope You Dance,220,Lee Ann Womack,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small
When you stand by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give fate a fighting chance

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake
But it's worth making
Don't let some hell bent heart
Leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above
More than just a passing glance

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always)
I hope you dance
(Rolling us along)
I hope you dance
(Tell me who)
I hope you dance
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
(Where those years have gone)

I hope you still feel small
When you stand by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always)
I hope you dance
(Rolling us along)
I hope you dance
(Tell me who)
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
I hope you dance
(Where those years have gone)

(Tell me who)
I hope you dance
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
(Where those years have gone)"
500 Miles Away From Home,29,Bobby Bare,"I'm 500 miles away from home
Teardrops fell on momma's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm 500 miles away from home

I know this is the same road I took the day I left home,
But it sure looks different now. And I guess I look
Different too, cause time changes everything. I wonder what
They'll say, when they see their boy looking this bad.

Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate
It's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still 500 miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home away from home
Oh I'm still 500 miles away from home"
Brand New Day,365,Joshua Radin,"Some kind of magic
Happens late at night
When the moon smiles down on me
And bathes me in it’s light

I fell asleep beneath you
In the tall blades of grass
When I woke the world was new
I never had to ask

It’s a brand new day
The sun is shinning
It’s a brand new day
For the first time
In such a long long time
I know
I’ll be ok

Most kind of stories
Save the best part for last
Most stories have a hero who finds
You make your past your past
Ya you make your past your past

It’s a brand new day
The sun is shinning
It’s a brand new day
For the first time
In such a long long time
I know
I’ll be ok

This cycle never ends
Gotta fall in order to mend

And it’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
For the first time
Inn such a long long time
I know
I’ll be ok"
The Other Side Of The Door,723,Taylor Swift,"in the heat of the fight

with your face and the
beautiful eyes and the
conversation with the
little white lies
and the faded picture of a
beautiful night
you carried me from your car
up the stairs
and i broke down crying
was she worth this mess
after everything and that
little black dress after
everything i must confess
i need you"
You're Not Sorry,0,Taylor Swift,"All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out
chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking
we'll be fine again
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry no no no no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you
if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me
waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry no no
You're not sorry no no

You had me falling for you honey
And it never would've gone away no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry no no
You're not sorry no no"
The Best Day,682,Taylor Swift,"I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got a big coat on
I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
And run and run
At the pumpkin patch
The tractor rolls on
The sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
The whole way home
I don't know why all
the trees change in the fall
I know that you're not
scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow
White's house is near or far away
But I know that I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean I come home crying
and You hold me tight
And grab the keys
And you drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away And we talk
and window shop Until I've
forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm gonna
talk to Now at school
I know I'm laughing on
the car ride home with you
Don't know how long
it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than nothing
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint
set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the edge of princesses
and pirate ships And the
seven dwarves Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady
in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees
change in the fall
And you were on my side
Even when I was wrong And I
love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today"
Ghosts,37,Laura Marling,"He walked down a busy street
Staring solely at his feet
Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side
Stood at the table where she sat
And removed his hat
In respect of her presence
Presents her with the pictures and says
""These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you.
These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you""

Opened up his little heart
Unlocked the lock that kept it dark
And read a written warning
Saying I'm still mourning
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts that broke my heart before I met you

[Chorus]
Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love

He went crazy at nineteen
Said he'd lost all his self esteem
And couldn't understand why he was cry, cry, crying, crying.

He would stare at empty chairs
Think of the ghosts that once sat there
The ghosts who broke his heart.
All the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts that broke his heart
All the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts,
The ghosts, the ghosts
The ghosts that broke my heart before I met you

[Chorus]

He says ""I'm so lost,
Not at all well""
Do as though there is nothing left to be
Turned out I'd been following him and he'd been following me
Do as though after it was over
We were just two lovers crying on each others shoulders
And I said

[Chorus: x2]"
That Girl,771,David Choi,"Oh tonight I'm feeling fine
I'm alone just wasting time
No Friday movie nights
Or romantic candle lights
I'm just having conversations
With the thoughts in my head
All I hear are angels crying
Oh won't they just sing instead
It would be wrong for me to say
I don't need that girl by my side
I don't need that girl in my life
I don't want to talk it out
Or hold her when she cries
I don't want to say she's my kind
I don't want to say that she's mine
I don't want to tell her that
I love her more than life
More than life Yeah
Love her more than life
Yeah yeah yeah
Honestly this won't do
How is she doing I tell myself
I'm feeling swell
But I know I'm such a fool
I could take it as a new beginning
But you know I don't feel that way
Who will take all this pain away
I know it's wrong for me to say
I don't need that girl by my side
I don't need that girl in my life
I don't want to talk it out
Or hold her when she cries
I don't want to say she's my kind
I don't want to say that she's mine
I don't want to tell her that
I love her more than life
More than life Yeah
Love her more than life
Yeah yeah yeah
Talk about a sin Was the day
I walked into the other side

I would run back in
I wouldn't waste no time

I know it's wrong for me to say
I don't need that girl by my side
I don't need that girl in my life
I don't want to talk it out
Or hold her when she cries
I don't want to say she's my kind
I don't want to say that she's mine
I don't want to tell her that
I love her more than life
More than life Yeah
Love her more than life
Yeah yeah yeah"

She Believes In Me,41,Kenny Rogers,"While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming
I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night
And I come to her and say
It was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I can find a way

While she lays waiting
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
And I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend
And there's no end while she lays crying
I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I can find a way
While she waits
While she waits
For me"

The Flood,318,Joshua Hyslop,"Here comes the flood again
Watch it fall from the sky
Feel it soak through
my flesh and my blood
Feel it burn in my eyes
When I say how much more can I take
I know the water's rising up
Watch the waves crest and break
And though I may not make a sound
I fear that I may drown
I fear that I may drown
Here comes the wind again
Cold that cuts to the bone
Pack my bags
and I'll head out the door
Here I am on my own
When I say how much more can I stand
I know my walls are falling down
I let the rocks who chose the sand
And though I know one left to blame
Still I cursed your name
I cursed your name
So now the end
What I've been running from
Though I've tried
I cannot lift my head
Oh what have I become
When I say how much more can I take
I know my time is running short
I am broken and I'm breaking
Though I've worn myself so thin
Coming home again
And though I do not know my heart
But I know myself into my bones
But if my bones should come apart
Then I'll have nothing left to give
But if you take me in
Coming home again
And if you take me in
Coming home again"

Colour Me (Acoustic),116,Juke Ross,"Here we are again
Fading light
Those gleaming eyes and freckled smile
Light up the night
Here we are alone
My lips on yours
The taste of the candy and salt
Drives me for more
Tied to my heart
with your ballpoint pen
Say you love me again and again
There will never be an end
To this love, my dear friend
You colour me
You colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled
with gold
You colour me
You colour my soul
Make me dream of things
I never did once before
Here we are again
Telling me it's my fault
Things I don't understand
Things beyond control
Here we are alone
You resting by my side
Those broken glass and shatter mines
Cloud my mind
Before you stab my heart
with your ballpoint pen
Say you love me again and again
There will never be an end
To this love, my dear friend
You colour me
You colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled
with gold
You colour me
You colour my soul
Made me dream of things
I never did once before
Lipstick stains on these clothes of mine
Hold your scent, frozen in time
Lipstick stains on these clothes of mine
Hold your love, frozen in time
You colour me
You colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled
with gold
You colour me
You colour my soul
Make me dream of things
I never did once before"
Mr. Tillman,351,Father John Misty,"Mr. Tillman good to see you again
There's a few outstanding charges
just before we check you in
Let's see here
you left your passport
in the mini fridge
And the message
with the desk says here
the picture isn't his
And oh just a reminder
about our policy
Don't leave your mattress in the rain
if you sleep on the balcony
Okay did you and your guests
have a pleasant stay
What a beautiful tattoo
that young man had on his face
And oh will you need a driver
out to Philly
Jason Isbell's here as well
And he seemed a little
worried about you
I'm feeling good
Damn I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud above
an island in my mind
Okay babe
don't be alarmed
this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No it's not too bad a crime
Mr. Tillman
for the seventh time
We have no knowledge of a film
that is being shot outside
Those aren't extras in a movie
they're our clientele
No they aren't running lines
and they aren't exactly thrilled
Would you like a regalo on the patio
Is there someone we can call
Perhaps you shouldn't drink alone
I'm feeling good
Damn I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud
above an island in my mind
Okay babe
don't be alarmed this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No it's not too bad a crime"
Pieces (Acoustic),72,Declan J Donovan,"The way that it was
Brings me down to my knees
Tell me when it's alright
Tell me when it's alright
Going back to the start
This game that we play
Looking for a lifeline
I'm running out of free tries

Chorus
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there ain't no shame in
Admitting you're lonely
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there ain't no shame in
Admitting you're lonely

Post-Chorus
'Cause I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces

Verse 2
I'm losing my words
Forgetting my lines
Knowing all the answers
No more second chances
I'm falling back in
Losing the time
Searching for a way home
But running down a wrong road


Chorus
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there ain't no shame in
Admitting you're lonely
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there ain't no shame in
Admitting you're lonely

Post-Chorus
'Cause I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces

Bridge
I know how this turns out, don't end well
But I'm keeping you around, I'm keeping you around

Chorus
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there ain't no shame in
Admitting you're lonely
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there ain't no shame in
Admitting you're lonely


Post-Chorus
'Cause I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces"
Passing Afternoon (Demo),108,iron & wine,"There are times
that walk from you
Like some passing afternoon
Summer warmed the open
window of her honeymoon
And she chose a yard to burn
But the ground remembers her
Wooden spoons her children
stir her bougainvillea blooms
There are things that drift away
Like our endless numbered days
Autumn blew the quilt right
off the perfect bed she made
And she's chosen to believe
In the hymns her mother sings
Sunday pulls its children
from their piles of fallen leaves
There are sailing ships that pass
All our bodies in the grass
Springtime calls her children
'til she lets them go at last
And she's chosen where to be
Though she's lost her wedding ring
Somewhere near her misplaced
jar of Bougainvillea seeds
There are things we can't recall
Blind as night that finds us all
Winter tucks her children in
her fragile china dolls
But my hands remember hers
Rolling around the shaded ferns
Naked arms her secrets still
like songs I'd never learned
There are names across the sea
Only now I do believe
Sometimes with the
windows closed
she'll sit and think of me
But she'll mend his tattered clothes
And they'll kiss as if they know
A baby sleeps in all our bones
so scared to be alone"
"Take Me Home, Country Roads (Original Version)",263,John Denver,"Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Chorus
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

Verse 2
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

Chorus
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

Bridge
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Chorus
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

Outro
Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads"

The Barrel,195,Aldous Harding,"I feel your love
I feel time is up
When I was a child
I never knew enough
what that would do to me
The wave of love
is a transient hut
The water’s the shell
and we are the nut
But I saw a hand arch
out of the barrel
Look at all the peaches
How do you celebrate
I can’t appearance out of nowhere
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
I rushed in to hold down your page
And now I sleep beside words
you do not read with me
And I hear a song
from inside the maze
The very one you made
You shook at the ivory mantel
As a poet I knew to be gentle
When you have child
so begins the braiding
And in that braid you stay
Look at all the peaches
I want to celebrate
I can’t appearance out of nowhere
Look at all the peaches
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
The wave of love
is a transient hut
The waters the shell
and we are the nut
But I saw a match struck
outside the barrel
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along"
Old Country Soul,191,The Reklaws,"Born and raised on a backroad
Speaker box and a can cold
Saturday we were rebels
But we were angels in church
Beat up boots on the front porch
Rusty roots in the back forty
Nothing's ever meant more to me
than that dirt
Never give it up never turn it down
Same back then as it is right now
No matter where I'm at man I know
I got that old country soul
That boondock swag in my stroll
Rock it wherever I roll
I got that old country
I got that old country soul
I wouldn't trade it for gold
Someday write it on my stone
I got that old country
old country soul
I'm a blue ribbon on a PBR
Countin' blessings countin' stars
Memories in a mason jar
That won't let me go
Like an old guitar
in a brand new song
Just 'cause you leave don't mean
you're gone
No matter where I'm at man I know
I got that old country soul
That boondock swag in my stroll
Rock it wherever I roll
I got that old country
I got that old country soul
I wouldn't trade it for gold
Someday write it on my stone
I got that old country
old country soul
It's who I'll always be
who I'll always be
It's every part of me soul
It's in my bones
my comfort zone that gravel road
That front porch light
that takes me home
Old country soul still got that
Soul yeah
Everyone wanna sing now
Old country soul
I got that old country soul
That boondock swag in my stroll
Rock it wherever I roll
I got that old country
I got that old country soul
I wouldn't trade it for gold
Someday write it on my stone
I got that old country
old country soul yeah
that ain't ever gonna change
I got that old country
old country soul"
Do Right,89,Wild Rivers,"We took a damn long drive
You were singing death cab
While I harmonized
Your chest can fall and rise
Moving like a needle drop
On my 45

But I don’t wanna go
I don’t wanna play dead yet
I’ve had moments
Faked a smile the moment I forget it
Walk a tight rope
Though we’re standing three feet off the ground
You should keep close
Cause we might just make it through the night
Putting up a fight
We could do right

And now at such great heights
I’m not looking down
I won’t split
With every bark and every bite
We could go another round
Or we could call it quits

I don’t wanna go
I don’t wanna play dead yet
I’ve had moments
Faked a smile the moment I forget it
Walk a tight rope
But we’re standing three feet off the ground
You should keep close
Cause we might just make it through the night
We’re putting up a fight
We could do right

We could do right
Do right

Do-do-do-do
We could do right
Do-do-do-do
We could do right
Do-do-do-do
We could do right
Do-do-do-do
We could do right

(I don’t wanna go)

Do-do-do-do
We could do right…

(I don’t wanna go)

I don’t wanna go
I don’t wanna play dead yet
I’ve had moments
Faked a smile the moment I forget it
Walk a tight rope
But we’re standing three feet off the ground
You should keep close
Cause we might just make it through the night
Putting up a fight
We could do right"

2016,140,Sam Hunt,"I'd put the whiskey back in the bottle
Put the smoke back in the joint
Look up at the sky and say
Okay okay okay
think you made your point
I'd cover up the pool at Skymont
I'd take some girls out of my phone
Give the nightlife back to Nashville
One night at a time
'til all the regret's gone
And I'd drive a thousand miles
to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies
could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
And hold you baby all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you
I thought I wanted my freedom
I told myself I'd have a ball
But it turns out going
out and chasing
Dreams and lonely women
Ain't freedom after all
If I could go back now
And take it back somehow
I'd drive a thousand
miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could
still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you baby all night
When your heart was all fixed up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you
If I could wrangle all my sins
Take 'em back and make amends
And do it all over again
I'd take the wrongs
and make 'em right
All the lonesome lonely nights
Pack 'em up and haul
'em all back home to you
And I'd drive a thousand
miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies
could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you baby all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And all the lonely nights
in between
And give 'em back to you
Give it all back to you"

Lovin' On You,364,Luke Combs,"Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush
soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I like a sunrise duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush
soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
Girl I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush
soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you"
Luv Note,149,chloe moriondo,"Sleeping has never been so easy
Though I'll still toss and twitch my feet
You occupy every one of my dreams
Makes closing my eyes
easier than it seems
And if it seems you don’t feel the same
That’s alright with me
I understand with me
isn't quite the best place to be
But your smile reminds me
of a place
that I can’t put my finger on, so
Just say the word and I’m gone
I linger on all the things
that you’ve said to me
Always wanna be your flower
I wanna make you feel real easy
I wanna hear you talk for hours
And baby love, if it’s bad
If it’s not what you’d hoped for
You can always take it back
I’d give you what I can afford
‘Cause everything you do I adore
So maybe you could let me
hold your hand real tight
And tell you
why the sea reminds me of you
And then sleeping
has never been so easy
Though I wish that you
could be near
It feels like I’ve fallen
for you completely
Maybe it’s best
that you can’t be here"
Punisher,190,Phoebe Bridgers,"When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived
with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles
on the roof were too much
But from the window,
it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's
Dianetics or stucco
The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason
I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide
in plain sight
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
And here, everyone knows
you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some,
looking your worst
But never not sweet
to the trust funds and punishers
Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
It's for the best
I can't open my mouth
and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop"
Riding with the King,52,Eric Clapton,"I dreamed I had a good job and I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade
A hundred dollars on a Kewpie doll
No pretty chick is going to make me crawl

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman, child and man
Gets a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring
Don't you know you're riding with the king

He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
He's going to check us all on out of here
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your prescription filled

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody, everybody clap your hands
And don't you doubt, love, the way that he sings
Don't you know you're riding with the king
Riding with the king
Don't you know you're riding with the king

A tuxedo and a shiny 335
You can see it in his face, the blues never lie
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
And don't you know we're riding with the king

I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old
With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm going to play this thing until the day I die

Don't you know we're riding with the king
Don't you know we're riding with the king
Riding, you're riding with the king
You're riding, you're riding with the king"

Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,180,Daniela Andrade,"Have yourself
a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on my troubles
will be out of sight
Have yourself
a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on my troubles
will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends
who are dear to us
They gather near
to us once more
Through the years
we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star
upon the highest bow
And have yourself
a merry little Christmas
Have yourself
a merry little Christmas
Have yourself
a merry little Christmas now"
Hot Summer,7,Oracle Sisters,"I was alone
In the boarded up streets
The closed signs swung like a poem
Here where the street sweepers sleep

It was a hot summer
I was feeling cool
There was no one there knowin'
I was lookin' for you

Well the bars were all empty
And the pavements were cracked
And the river ran wild
So I was fast on its track

It was a hot summer
I sang out of tune
There was no one there knowin'
I was just a fool

I've got burgundy blood
A tiger stone in my boot
Hip flask in my pocket
We could dance on the roof

It was a hot summer
And I'm just a fool
There was no one there knowing
I was looking for you

On the other side
On the other side of the wild and true sages
On the other side
On the other side of you

It was a hot summer
I was just a fool
I knew it right then
But there was nothing to do"

Heart of the Woods,3,Kacey Musgraves,"Under the ground
There's a neighborhood that can't be seen
And up in the trees, there are voices that are echoing
And up in the trees, there are voices that are echoing
A million different languages
Songs we sing

It's in our nature
To look out for each other
In the heart of the woods
When there is danger
We'll take care of each other
In the heart of the woods

It's in our nature

Heaven Is,7,Kacey Musgraves,"We spent all day where the north wind blows
And you bought me a lavender rose
Put it in water when we got home
That's what heaven is

No tears to cry, and nothing to mourn
Wearing your shirt so tattered and torn
Lying in your arms, so safe and warm
That's what heaven is

I don't care for money or fame
All for you, I'd give it all away
The way you sound when you call my name
That's what heaven is

Nobody knows where we go when we die
Maybe we'll ride white horses in the sky
And if we don't then, darling, tonight
That's what heaven is

If all I have is the light in your eyes
That's what heaven is"

Tom's Diner,201,Suzanne Vega,"I am sitting In the morning
At the diner On the corner
I am waiting At the counter
For the man To pour the coffee
And he fills it Only halfway
And beforeI even argue
He is looking Out the window
At somebody Coming in

It is always Nice to see you
Says the man Behind the counter
To the woman Who has come in
She is shaking Her umbrella
And I look The other way
As they are kissing Their hellos
I'm pretending Not to see them
Instead I pour the milk

I open Up the paper
There's a story Of an actor
Who had died While
he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking For the funnies
When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so I raise my head

There's a woman On the outside
Looking inside Does she see me
No she does not Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection
And I'm trying Not to notice
That she's hitching Up her skirt
And while she's Straightening
her stockings
Her hair Is getting wet

Oh this rain It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening
To the bells Of the cathedral
I am thinking Of your voice"
Lonely Stranger,131,Eric Clapton,"I must be invisible
No one knows me
I have crawled
down dead end streets
On my hands and knees

I was born with a ragin thirst
A hunger to be free
But I've learned
through the years
Don't encourage me

Cause I'm a lonely stranger here
Well beyond my day
And I don't know what's goin on
I'll be on my way

Yes I'II
I'll be on my way
Yes I'II

Yes I'II
I'll be on my way
When I walk stay behind
Don't get close to me
Cause it's sure to end in tears
So just let me be

Some will say that I'm no good
Maybe I agree
Take a look then walk away
That's all right with me

Cause I'm a lonely stranger here
Well beyond my day
And I don't know what's goin on
I'll be on my way

Yes I'II
I'll be on my way
Yes I'II
I'll be on my way

Lately I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I'd have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way
I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
I'd find a love who cares just for me
Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you

I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
I'd find a love who cares just for me

Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right

All of our dreams would come true
When love comes over me and you
All of our dreams would come true
When love comes over me and you

Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is A Season),195,The Byrds,"To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep
To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time to build up,a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones,
a time to gather stones together
To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace,
a time to refrain from embracing

To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time for love, a time for hate
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late"
Blue River,32,Eric Andersen,"Old man go to the river
To drop his bale of woes
He could go if he wanted to
It's just a boat to row you know
listen to me now
Blue River keep right on rollin
All along the shore line
Keep us safe from
the deep and the dark
Cause we don't want to stray too far
Spent the day with my old dog Mo
Down an old dirt road
What he's thinking lord I don't know
But for him bet the time
just go so slow
Don't you know

All along the shore line
Keep us safe from
the deep and the dark
Cause we don't want to stray too far

with his ax in his hand
Believin that the crops are in
Fire wood stacked ten by ten
For the wife the folks the kids
All of the kin and a friend

All along the shore line
Keep us safe from
the deep and the dark
Cause we don't want to stray too far
Cause we don't want to stray too far"
Stand By Your Man,77,Tammy Wynette,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love
To just one man
You'll have bad time
And he'll have good time
Doing things that
You don't understand

But if you love him you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
But if you love him
Oh, be proud of him
'Cause after all he's just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms
To cling to
And something warm
To come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world
You love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

Stand by your man
And show the world
You love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man"

Give Me Strength,148,Eric Clapton,"Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on.
Dear Load, give me strength to carry on.

But please, give me strength to carry on.

Save The Last Dance For Me,41,Emmylou Harris,"You can dance
Every dance with the girl who gives you the eye
Let her hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the girl who'd like to treat you right
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me

Oh I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Dance and sing
But while we're apart don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me

You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You must tell her no

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me"
You Decorated My Life,50,Kenny Rogers,"All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, ev'ry note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams area apart
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you cam along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shinin' soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life"
Empty Chairs,108,Don McLean,"I feel the trembling tingle of a sleepless night
Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright

Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
And the fragrance of your flowers rest beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Never thought the words you said were true
Never thought you said just what you meant
Never knew how much I needed you
Never thought you'd leave, until you went

Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would"
Making Memories Of Us (Radio Single Edit),144,Keith Urban,"I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice
that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow
where the wild bees swarm
And I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
making memories of us
I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention
like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world
better than it's ever been
And I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
making memories of us
We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way
I'm gonna be here for you
from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits
but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to
meet you with a warm, wet kiss
And I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
making memories of us
I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll win your trust
making memories of us"
I'll Wait For You,0,Joe Nichols,"The snow in Montana was three feet high
The lady at the counter said there ain't no flights
And so he called her on the telephone
He said, 'I'll rent a car, and I'll drive home'

And she said, 'I'll wait for you
Like I did last year
At Christmas time with your family here
And your truck broke down out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you'

Now he's on his cell phone in a Coupe De ville
Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
Her heart is achin' 'cause she wants him home
She says, 'I'll wait for you like in '68
When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
Remember, dear, our son's first cry
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you'

He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said, she's in a better place
She said to give this you this note just in case

And it said, 'I'll wait for you at Heaven's gate
Oh, I don't care how long it takes
And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best friend
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
P.S. I love you, too
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you'"
I Am a Rock,84,Simon & Garfunkel,"A winter's dat in a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island
I've built walls,
A fortress deep and mighty
that none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship cause pain.
It's laughter ad it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock
I am an island
Don't talk of love
Well. I've heard the words before.
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't distrub the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island
I have my books and my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor, hinding in my room, safe within mt womb
I touch no one touches me.
I am a rock
I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
Abd an island never cries"
Love Your Memory,9,Miranda Lambert,"I don't want to see you or feel you

I don't want to look into your eyes

I don't want to touch you or miss you

I just want to love your memory tonight



I can't handle all this pain

All we ever do is fight anyway

Why we even tried I haven't a clue

With hearts involved

There's way too much to lose



I don't want to see you or feel you

I don't want to look into your eyes

I don't want to touch you or miss you

I just want to love your memory tonight



You were something else to look at

Your intentions they weren't all bad

Tried to make me something I wasn't

Lord knows there ain't no future

In all that



I don't want to see you or feel you

I don't want to look into your eyes

I don't want to touch you or miss you

I just want to love your memory tonight"
The Most Beautiful Girl,43,Charlie Rich,"Hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?
I woke up this mornin'
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong, and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me
So, hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby

Tell her I need my baby

Eskimo,663,Damien Rice,"Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
I find myself disposed
Brightness fills empty space
I search of inspiration
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my eskimo friend
I look to my eskimo friend
I look to my eskimo friend
When I'm down, down, down..

Rain it wets muddy roads
I find my self esposed
Tapping doors, but irritate
In search of destination
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my eskimo friend

When I'm down, down, down."
Happy,351,Mocca,"Life is just a bowl of cherries

Ballade At Thirty-Five,42,Carla Bruni,"> This, no song of ing?©nue,
This, no ballad of innocence;
This, the rhyme of a lady who
Followed ever the natural bents.
This, a solo of sapience,
This, a chantey of sophistry,
This, the sum of experiments, --
I loved them until they loved me.

Decked in garments of sable hue,
Daubed with ashes of myriad Lents,
Wearing shower bouquets of rue,
Walk I ever in penitence.
Oft I roam, as my heart repents,
Through God's acre of memory,
Marking stones, in my reverence,
""I loved them until they loved me.""

Pictures pass me in long review,--
Marching columns of dead events.
I was tender, and, often, true;
Ever a prey to coincidence.
Always knew I the consequence;
Always saw what the end would be.
We're as Nature has made us -- hence
I loved them until they loved me.

Princes, never I'd give offense,
Won't you think of me tenderly?
Here's my strength and my weakness, gents -
I loved them until they loved me."
At Last The Secret Is Out,134,Carla Bruni,"At last the secret is out
As it always must come in the end
The delicious story is ripe to tell
To the intimate friend

Over the tea-cups and in the square
The tongue has its desire
Still waters run deep, my dear
There's never smoke without fire

Behind the corpse in the reservoir
Behind the ghost on the links
Behind the lady who dances
And the man who madly drinks

Under the look of fatigue
The attack of migraine and the sigh
There is always another story
There is more than meets the eye

For the clear voice suddenly singing
High up on the convent wall
The scent of the elder bushes
The sporting prints in the hall

The croquet matches in summer
The handshake, the cough
The kiss, the kiss, the kiss
There is always a wicked secret
A private reason for this

At last the secret is out
At last the secret is out
At last the secret is out"
Skipping Stone,225,Amos Lee,"I don't know
if I can do this
alone
Oh after all our
sweet love is flown
I've been a running
I've been skipping like a stone
And I don't know if I
I can do this
all alone
When I met her
she was standing by a door
I ain't never
seen a light like that before
Now she's left me
for something more sure
And I don't know if I
I can do this
anymore
'Cause lovers will come
lovers will go
This rare seed are
from which true love might grow
If you see her won't
you please
say hello
'Cause I don't know
I can do this
alone"
Valentines (Bonus Track),"1,064",David Choi,"I see a couple strollin'
down the street
They're so in love
There is not a worry
And to the clock they said goodbye
They ain't in a hurry
And sometimes I feel kind of lonely
Ask myself where is my one and only
Until she comes to me I'll wait
Until then I shouldn't be
feeling this way
Won't let no Valentine's get me down
Or when Christmas time comes around
Just cuz I'm alone right now
Don't mean I should hold a frown
Oh in the meantime
love is here you'll find
The simple things
that slip your mind
The joy of hope for better days
You know that love
can find its ways

When you finally find the one
who you can call your own
You can tell yourself
the wait was worth it all
Cuz you got something
here to last forever
I can smile cuz there's so much
in store The future holds for me
more than I will ever know
Shouldn't make no room
for feeling sad
Won't let no Valentine's get me down
Or when Christmas time comes around
Just cuz I'm alone right now
Don't mean I should hold a frown
Oh in the meantime
love is here you'll find
The simple things
that slip your mind
The joy of hope for better days
You know that love can find its ways

Won't let no Valentine's get me down
Or when Christmas time comes around
Just cuz I'm alone right now
Don't mean I should hold a frown
Oh in the meantime
love is here you'll find
The simple things
that slip your mind
The joy of hope for better days
You know that love can find its ways"
Back To December (Acoustic Version),"1,003",Taylor Swift,"I'm so glad you
made time to see me
How's life
Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good busier than ever
Small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time you saw me
Still burns in the back
of your mind
You gave me roses
and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you
saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
It turns out freedom ain't
nothin' but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had
when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back
myself leaving
When your birthday passed
And I didn't call
And i think about summer all the
beautiful times
I watched you laughin'
from the passenger side
And realized I loved you
in the fall
And then the cold came
With the dark days
when the fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you
saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
It turns out freedom ain't
nothin' but missing you
Wishing I'd realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn it around and change
my own mind
I'd go back to December
all the time

I miss your tan skin
your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms
That September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again
I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it
but I can't
So if the chain is on your door
I understand
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you
saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom
ain't nothin' but missing you
Wishing I'd realized
what I had when you were mine
turn it around and
all the time
I'd go back to December
turn it around and change
my own mind
I'd go back to December
All the time

All the time"
From Prying Plans Into The Fire,503,Tamas Wells,"Undeserving favours mine
we gather while they stray
And we would browse
their terrace house
while they went away
You would play their records
and i would eat their light rye
Sooner than wait the shelves
were straight then
we had arrived
They said to take their birds
inside only over night
We would feed them
all the seed and
thought they would survive
But they were buried
by the apple tree
In a grave as wide as my hands
So we were scared to see
Them when they arrived
Them when they arrived
Them when they arrived
Undeserving favours mine
we gather while they stray
And we would browse
their terrace house
while they went away
But when you're over prying
plans and into other fires
Please do tell them all was well
when we had arrived
then we had arrived
then we had arrived"
Twilight,203,Elliott Smith,"""Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
I better stop now before I start crying
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
I don't want to see the day when it's dying

She's a sight to see, she's good to me
I'm already somebody's baby
She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
But I'm already somebody's baby

You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together

I'm nice to you, I could make it through
That you're already somebody's baby
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me baby

Because your candle burns too bright
Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight

You're wonderful, when it's beautiful
But I'm already somebody's baby
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too
Well, I'm already somebody's baby
Already somebody's baby

Underneath Your Love,299,David Choi,"Just to see that smile on
your pretty face
I'll do everything I have to
Won't let anything in my way
yeah I'll admit it
I get butterflies in my stomach
when I'm with you
cause you know we're fresh in love
Underneath Your Love
is where I wanna be
Oh I never ever felt this good
and I can't get enough
Oh what'd you do to me
I can't fall asleep
You put a spell on me and now
I'm Underneath Your Love
The feeling is simple
like the words I sing
Everybody knows the feeling
it's a cloud nine thing
24 hours in a day is not enough
for you and me
For you and me
Underneath Your Love
is where I wanna be
Oh I never ever felt this good
and I can't get enough
Oh what'd you do to me
I can't fall asleep
You put a spell on me and now
I'm Underneath Your Love
I don't wanna feel
anything else but this
I don't wanna be
anywhere else but here
Underneath Your Love
is where I wanna be
Oh I never ever felt this good
and I can't get enough
Oh what'd you do to me
I can't fall asleep
You put a spell on me and now
I'm Underneath

"You Need Me, I Don't Need You (Live Ustream)",258,Ed Sheeran,"Now I’m in town break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night
In front of a new crowd
That’s you now ciao
Seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can’t no I won’t hush
I say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See I’m true my songs are where my heart is
I’m like glue I stick to other artists
I’m not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
And move to greener pastures
See I’m real I do it all it’s all me
I’m not fake don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put
Give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cos You need me man i dont need you
You need me man i dont need you
You need me man i don`t need you at all
You need me man i don`t need you
You need me man i don`t need you
You need me man i don`t need you
You need me man i don`t need you at all
You need me
I sing I write my own tune and
I write my own verse hell
Don`t need another wordsmith
to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer
You’re just bluffing
Your name’s on the credits
And you didn’t write nothing
I sing fast
I know that all my shit’s cool
I will blast
And I didn’t go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I can’t last if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
‘A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi’
Cos You need me man i dont need you
You need me man i dont need you
You need me man i don`t need you at all
You need me man i don`t need you
You need me man i don`t need you
You need me man i don`t need you
You need me man i don`t need you at all
You need me
And all i want in this cold world
Is to make music
And use it not to abuse it
And get infected Defected
With the who`s who of music
Who did it Who is it Who`s in it
Who what the hell does it matter
Chitter Chatter don`t matter
What a Yidda Yidda Yatta
It don`t matter to me
All i want is a bit of dignity
You need to battle this industry
Freely to be me in this CD needy world can you hear me
Hey
So i keep singing that
When i first started this rapping shit
I felt Pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadist
And just developed a hater rador
Im made for the stars Pay my grind in the dark
And they came with the remedy kicking rhymes
With the melody hennesy shots
And all these fools on the block
Who said you`ve gotta be a Gangster now
to raise to the top
Im just a normal casual usual
everyday type of guy with my head in the sky
Ed sheeran urban angel comming ready to die
So see the signs stand at the side open your eyes
And take a look and realise
The ressurection arised and theres a missed clears
I arised from my tomb in the sky
I`m all alone a lone star urban angel
Raising from the ashes suprising no haters
Guiding or moving steady now
You can find me in the club Bottle full of bub
Look mami i got the X if you into taking Drugs
Im into having Sex i ain`t into making love
So come give me a hug if your into getting rough
You can find me in the club Bottle full of bub

A big fat bag of high grade weed i`ve got to have it
`Cos if i don`t have it in my pocket i will panic

One dem tings smoking weed it make me feel good
Burning high grade semsolina now
Yes it makes me feel good
But listen man a couple
semsolina is a drug and if i start

Where i come from that talk That

Where i come from burning weed
It is a blessing from above
Where i come from yes we burn it
When we listen Rub a dub
Where i come from yes we burn it
After we just a make love
Where i come from we burn it
When the sun starts shine
I Blaze high grade weed all the time

You're Only Lonely,301,JD Souther,"When the world is ready to fall

You need somebody
there to hold you
So you can call out my name
When you're only lonely
Now don't you ever be ashamed
When you're only lonely

Cinder And Smoke (Album),358,iron & wine,"Give me your hand
The dog in the garden row
is covered in mud
And dragging your mother's clothes
Cinder and smoke
The snake in the basement
Found the juniper shade
The farmhouse is burning down
Give me your hand
And take what you will tonight
I'll give it as fast
And high as the flame will rise
Cinder and smoke
Some whispers around the trees
The juniper bends
As if you were listening
Give me your hand
Your mother is drunk
As all the firemen shake
A photo from father's arms
Cinder and smoke
You asked me to pray for rain
With ash in your mouth
You'll ask it to burn again"

My Day,958,Danielle Bradbery,"Like a lotus flower growing in the dirt
Ain't nobody ever noticed what its worth
Til the sun shines and the rain falls and
In no time it all is beautiful
This is my day this is my day
Ohhhh wont let it slip away
Oh waiting for these changes to say this is my day
There's a voice inside that's trying to be heard hmmm
And its echoing across the universe
If you listen it'll lead you to that place you've always been running to
This is my day this is my day
Ohhhh wont let it slip away
Oh I'm waiting for these changes to say this is my day
I always saw it coming
A little light behind the clouds
This is the start of something
My heart believes it now
This is my day this is my day
Oh wont let it slip away
Oh this is my day this is my day
Oh wont let it slip away
Oh I'm waiting for these changes to say
This is my day this is my day ohhh

My Favourite Faded Fantasy,"1,966",Damien Rice,"You could be my favourite taste
To touch my tongue
I know someone who could serve me love
But it wouldn't fill me up
You could have my favourite face
And favourite name
I know someone who could play the part
But it wouldn't be the same
No it wouldn't be the same
No it wouldn't be the same
No it wouldn't be the same
As with you
You could be my favourite place
I've ever been
I got lost in your willingness
To dream within the dream
You could be my favourite faded fantasy
I've hung my happiness upon what it all could be
And what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you
You could hold the secrets that save
Me from myself
I could love you more than love could
All the way from hell
You could be my poison, my cross
My razor blade
I could love you more than life
If I wasn't so afraid
Of what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
Of what it all, what it all could be
With you
What it all, what it all could be
Of what it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you
Loved is all that bloomed
Always what you did

Trusty and True,850,Damien Rice,"We've wanted to be trusty and true

And we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So fellas, lay down your fears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here
'Cause we never wanted to be lusty or lewd
Nor tethered to prudish strings
And we never wanted to be jealously tuned
Nor withered into ugly things
But we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So fellas, lay down your spears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here
And if all that you are
Is not all you desire
Then, come
Come, let yourself be wrong
Come, it's already begun
Come, come alone
Come with fear, come with love
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with friends, come with foes
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with me, then let go
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come so carefully closed
Come however you are
Just come
Come, come along
Come with sorrows and songs
Come however you are
Just come, come along
Come, let yourself be wrong
Come however you are
Just come"
When You Say Nothing At All,161,Alison Krauss,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all"
The Blower,421,Damien Rice,"And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
Did I say that I loathe you
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
My mind my mind

Die A Happy Man,"1,189",Thomas Rhett,"Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes
and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark
under September stars
in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever
tell you enough
That all I need in this life is
your crazy love
If I never get to see
the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see
the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand
in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah
Baby and that red dress
brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress
makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint you're a God
it's the cutest the hottest
a masterpiece
It's too good to be true
nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know
that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is
your crazy love
If I never get to see
the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see
the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand
in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah
I don't need no vacation
no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home
listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace
And if I never get to build
my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car
up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand
in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could girl
I could die
I could die a happy man"
The Ship In Port,419,Radical Face,"Some says your dreams
are a distant road
Down which our hearts
would like to go
But I have always stayed in place
Under that old illusion that is safe
You said the ship in
port is the safer one
But it's not the reason
it was made
So forgive me if I wander off
And forgive me more if I just stay
Sing another song
for the lost ones
We're the ones
who need it the most
Every time you run it'll cost ya'
But it doesn't stop us runnin'
If a coward dies
a thousand times
Then there's a graveyard
in my head
'Cause it took me
years to say the words
That you denied even need said
Sing another song
for the lost ones
We're the ones
who need it the most
Nothin' that you fear is forgotten
It follows you around like
Then everything danced
to a stranger tune
And we found our song
and we found our truth
And now that
we know it's that we always knew
Farewell to the chains
we were born into
And as we danced among
the ashes of our arms
We laughed it off
And then we burned our
tiny world to find the ocean
Just beyond those paper walls"
My Church,842,Maren Morris,"I've cussed on a Sunday
I've cheated and I've lied
I've fallen down
from grace a few too many times
But I find my holy redemption
when I put this car in drive
roll the windows down
and turn up the dial
Can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church
When Hank brings the sermon
and Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold cold heart burning
hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world
gets heavy
and I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling
the radio scrolling
until my sins wash away
Can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church
Can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church
Hey can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that's my church
Yeah I guess that's my church

You gotta be down with the way I am
All my flaws and all my quirks
All my glitter all my dirt

And these four walls

In that bright land
To which i go.

[Chorus]
I'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going over jordan
I'm only go
Going over home.

[Verse 2]
I know dark clouds
Will gather on me
I know my way
My way is rough and steep
Yeah, and beautiful fields
Lie just before me
And God's redeemed
Their vigils keep.

[Chorus]
I'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going over jordan
I'm only go
Going over home.

I'm going there to see my Mother
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going over jordan
I'm only go
Going over home.

[Verse 3]
I want to wear
That crown of glory
When I get home
To that good land
Well, I want to shout
Salvation's story
In concert with
All the blood-washed band.

[Chorus]
I'm going there to see my Saviour
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going over jordan
I'm only go
Going over home
Well, I'm only go
Going over home
Yeah, only"

She Gives Her Love to Me,109,She & Him,"She said
Love me just a little bit more
Hold me just a little bit longer
Say my name the way you used to
She gives her love to me
unconditionally
How could I ever refuse ya
And if the year that
I was born is like the morning
And the year that
I die is like the night
Then this time between
is such a short and precious thing
I can't wait till
after the evening's done
just to love you
Days and nights with her
We grow just a little bit stronger
I tried in vain one time to trace it
Time was we ran away
From the truth and
the words of the music
But there's still time for us to face it
She said
Love me just a little bit more
Hold me just a little bit longer
Say my name the way you used to
She gives her love to me
unconditionally
How could I ever refuse ya
And if the year that
I was born is like the morning
Then the year that
I die is like the night
Then this time between
is such a short and precious thing
I can't wait till after the evening's
done just to love you
And know I need you still
You know I always will
And know I need you still
You know I always will
And know I need you still
You know I always will"
Call Your Mama (Feat. Little Big Town),95,Seth Ennis,"Take one last look in that rear view on your way
Outta that stick around town you're about to leave behind
And go get lost to find yourself
Don't be afraid to go and have yourself the craziest of times
Make some new friends
Be someone you've never been
But every now and then

Chorus
Call your mama
Sit and listen to her small town drama
And get you all caught up on all your sisters and your brothers
Boy, listen to your mother
'Cause you ain't ever gonna get another
Someone you get to call your mama, yeah

Verse 2
One of these days on down the road
You're gonna find
You a strong willed girl with a gentle heart like hers
And don't forget to call her dad 'fore you buy that ring
And if they both say yes then first things first

Chorus
Call your mama
Sit and listen to her small town drama
And get you all caught up on all your sisters and your brothers
Boy, listen to your mother

Call your mama

Cry Pretty,456,Carrie Underwood,"I'm sorry
But I'm just a girl not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keeping it together
I hold my composure for worse or for better
So I apologize
If you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can't dress it up in lace or rhinestones
Don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain
So let it flow like a river

You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty
Oh, no, you can't

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty yeah yeah yeah yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
No no no
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby, oh yeah

No, you can't cry pretty"
Lonely Man of Winter,244,Sufjan Stevens,"In the world that you would make up
With unicorns and buffalo packs
I know that you would wake up
With the sunny side
touching your back
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
Coming up with theories on him
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
He's riding in the devil's abyss
Oh I would rate the future
If I could put a finger on it
But I have no idea
If what I want is better than this
Is it the lonely man of winter
I could put my finger on that
Is it the lonely drive to Denver
The loneliness
of Hoppington's hat
Is it the time we spent in silence
The silence of a winter he had
Is it the lonely man of winter
I could put my finger on that
And even if it's Christmas
Could we just pretend for a bit
That everything we went through
Was someone else's carpenter kiss"
Lonely Man of Winter (Doveman Mix feat. Melissa Mary Ahern),420,Sufjan Stevens,"In the world

Is it the lonely man of Christmas
He's riding in the devil's abyss
Oh I would write the future
If I could put a finger on it
But I have no idea
If what I want is better than this
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
He's hoping for a break
in the plan
Is it the lonely drive to Denver
The loneliness
of holding your hand
Is it the time we spent in silence
The silence of a wintery head
Is it the lonely man of winter
I could put my finger on that
And even if it's Christmas
Could we just pretend for a bit
That everything we went through
Was something
so much better than this"

Unable to learn my own name
Or blow the wind away
What would you say

Take It One Day at a Time (Acoustic Ver.),66,Jennifer Chung,"I Know It Hurts

It Hurts
You’re Living
But Don’t Feel Alive
No Motivation Or Drive
As You Search For Answers To Why
Oh Why
Why me
Won’t Somebody Please
Take My Burdens Away
I Can’t Do This Today
You’ve Got To Hold On
Hold Onto What You Believe In
Weather Through Every Season
Take It One Day At A Time
You’ve Got To Hold On
Don’t Put Aside
What You’re Feeling
There Is A Process Of Healing

Everyone’s Counting On You
Unaware You Need Help Too
But You Don’t Say A Word
Too Much Work To Be Done
No Fun
Go Through The Motions Eyes Closed
‘Cause You’re Always
Doing The Most
But The More That You Do
The More You Seem To Lose

All Too Well,904,Taylor Swift,"I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

Verse 1
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

Pre-Chorus 1
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

Chorus 1
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Verse 2
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me

Pre-Chorus 2
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Chorus 2
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Bridge
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Verse 3
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

Chorus 3
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Outro
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
If You Want To,598,beabadoobee,"If you wanna take me
Go ahead and try my head
Experience is nothing compared to
The sleep paralysis in my bed
If you wanna love me
Try to get inside my brain
Experience is nothing compared to
The nights I'm always up so late
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis 'til I die
Die
'Cause if you want
you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to only if you want to
If you want you could go
ahead and fix my head
If you want to only if you want to
If you wanted to
If you try to
Wishing I still had my dreams
Late night started take up space
'Cause every time I try to remember
Lack of sleep takes half my brain
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis 'til I die
Die
'Cause if you want
you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to only if you want to
If you want you could go
ahead and fix my head
If you want to only if you want to
Use some pesticides
and throw it in my brain
If you want to only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up
at night and I'm going insane
If they try to only if they try to
If you wanted to
If you try to
'Cause if you want
you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to only if you want to
If you want you could go

Over The Moon (Acoustic Ver.),132,The Hues,"When you left I met a girl
who turns the world upside down
Counting satellites
we let the twilight swim
inside our eyes
I can almost reach the clouds
but I can't lift
my feet off the ground
I should be over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
Why don't I feel like I'm
Holding the stars
when she's lying in my arms
I should be over the moon
But I still ain't over you
You took me high
you held my hand
taught me to dance on the skyline
Like wild stallions
we're riding free
she's showing me new horizons
I can almost see the sun
but I can't lift my feet and run
I should be over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
Why don't I feel like I'm
Holding the stars
when she's lying in my arms
I should be over the moon
But I still ain't over you
I thought her kiss would carry me
Across the deep ocean blue
But loving her ain't
like loving you
You send me over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
You make me feel like I'm
Holding the stars
when you're lying in my arms
I should be over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
I wanna feel like I'm
Holding the stars
I want you back in my arms
I should be over the moon
I still ain't over you
I still ain't over you"
New Tattoo,89,Brian Dunne,"You got a new tattoo
And you bought a nice pair of shoes
To remind you who you used to be
When life was something brand new
‘Cause now you sleep a little lighter at night
And you wake up when the sky gets light
And crawl into the kitchen at dawn
And tell yourself it’s alright

You swore you didn’t want strings attached
And to be tethered to the telephone
But now there’s no one here to talk to
And you prefer to sleep alone
All the chances that you couldn’t take
Mistakes that you couldn’t afford to make
Well what would it have cost you?

When you had a new tattoo
And you were only 22
You had a hole in your shirt
But there was nothing that you couldn’t do
Now you’re standing in the vestibule
Wondering how they got the best of you
Now that you do your own laundry
Now that there’s always something pressing you

You swore you didn’t want strings attached
And to be tethered to the telephone
But now there’s no one here to talk to
And you prefer to sleep alone
All them chances that you couldn’t take
Mistakes that you couldn’t afford to make
Oh and what would it have cost you?

Well your dad is gonna cover away
And mom is gonna’ say it’s okay
When you call them every Monday at 9
And tell them that it’s going fine
All your friends, they just exhaust you
You could’ve left, but where would you go off to?
Oh, and what would it have cost you?

So you got a new tattoo
To make you feel something new
The sign of a cross on your thigh
And you don’t even really know why
But you’re hoping that it marks the end
Of a time that you could just forget
So you call it a draw for the night
And you tell yourself it’s alright"

Better Together,367,Luke Combs,"A 40 HP Johnson
on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns
barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn
and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window
and one hand on the wheel
Some things just go better
together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this
ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings
Or pourin' your heart into a song
that you ain't gonna sing
It's a match made up in heaven
like good ol' boys and beer
And me as long
as you're right here
Your license in my wallet
when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every
coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say I love you too
is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into
mine like a needle in a groove
Some things just go better
together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol'
guitar if it ain't got no strings
Or pourin' your heart into a song
that you ain't gonna sing
It's a match made up in heaven
like good ol' boys and beer
And me as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name
Would just sound better together
and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar
if it ain't got no strings
Or pourin' your heart into a song

Feel You Here,110,Melissa Polinar,"Dark
Here inside my heart
Distance from the stars
Feels like we're going nowhere
Far
Miles from my heart
The space between the stars
Feels like we're worlds apart
And even though you had to go away
I'm still with you
And even if I couldn't make you stay
I still feel you here
Feel you here
Maybe these words
will never reach you
Maybe that's alright
We'll just keep hoping things
will get better in time
Maybe these words won't mean a thing
And maybe you're doing fine
Wish it was you instead of my guitar
Holding you inside my arms
Try
To act like I'm just fine
But really deep inside
Feels like I'm just getting by
And even though you had to go away
I'm still with you
And even if I couldn't make you stay
I still feel you here
Feel you here
Maybe these words
will never reach you
Maybe that's alright
We'll just keep hoping things
will get better in time
Maybe these words won't mean a thing

Wish it was you instead of my guitar
Holding you inside my arms

make you,123,Lindsay Ell,"Thirteen staring in the mirror
You still look so innocent
but that was all gone yesterday
At eighteen
you'll see it a little clearer
As something that was taken
before you could give it away
You'll feel dirty
you'll feel guilty for
what was done to you
They'll be a canyon in your chest
for what you can't undo
It's gonna make you hate yourself
When you didn't hate yourself at all
It's gonna make you build a fortress
Where you never had a wall
It's gonna make you question God
And wonder if he even cares
'Cause it's so messed up
it's so wrong
It's just so unfair
And when you're broken
past the point
Of what a broken heart can take
The cracks'll heal
but you'll always feel the break
And that's what's gonna make you
At twenty
it hits you like a racecar
It still feels like a new scar
One that you dont talk about
At twenty five
you'll find the strength to say it
And even though you can't change it
There's peace in saying it out loud
You'll feel angry
you'll feel sad once
you see it's not your fault
And that canyon in your chest
is that little girl you lost
It's gonna make you hate yourself
When you didn't hate yourself at all
It's gonna make you build a fortress
Where you never had a wall
It's gonna make you question God
And wonder if he even cares
'Cause it's so messed up
it's so wrong
It's just so unfair
And when you're broken past the point
Of what a broken heart can take
The cracks'll heal
but you'll always feel the break
And that's what's gonna make you
It's gonna make you love yourself
When you don't love yourself at all
'Cause if you can get through that
There's no valley that's too tall
And all those questions you ask God
Are still gonna be there
'Cause it's so messed up
it's so wrong
It's just so unfair
And it's amazing where a broken
heart can take you
All the things that bend
and stain and break you
That's what's gonna make you
But that's what's gonna make you"

What If I,455,Elle Mears,"I wonder what
if I had gone to Californa
Seventeen with nothin' but a car
And a thing for seventies
and palm trees
Would I have made it by now
Would I be playin' to a crowd
That most of us only
play to in our dreams
I wonder what if I had
gone to New York City
Paper walls on 41st in a five-floor
walk-up writin' like crazy
Would anybody know my name
Would I be on the edge of fame
Would I make it
Luck right into meant-to-be
What if I never second-guessed it
Took a chance and no regrets
And chased a life a long
way from the rear view
What if I traded every moment
Just to never look back on it
And wonder if I'm missin' somethin'
But lookin' back I wonder
would I change my mind
What if I
What if I what if I what if I what if I
I wonder what
if I had been on a red eye
Chasin' down a sunset crowd
For a one-off show
somewhere down south
Would I have missed Mama's call
Sayin' Granddad took a fall
he ain't alright
Would I have missed
that goodbye
Or would he tell me
Girl you only get one life
What if I never second-guessed it
Took a chance and no regrets
And chased a life a long way
from the rear view
What if I traded every moment
Just to never look back on it
And wonder if I'm missin' somethin'
But lookin' back I wonder
would I change my mind
What if I
What if I what if I what if I what if I
Ooh what if I
What if I what if I what if I what if I
What if I never second-guessed it
Took a chance and no regrets
And chased a life a long way
from the rear view
What if I traded every moment
Just to never look back on it
And wonder if I'm missin' somethin'
If I'm missin' somethin'
But lookin' back
I wonder would I change my mind
Change my mind
And miss out on this life of mine
What if I

Blame it on timing
Weakening August water
Loose-eyed in morning
Sunlight covered over
Wading in sight of fire

[Chorus 1]
And we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose

[Verse 2]
Soon as I knew you
All so wide open
Wading inside of fire
As if I just saw you
Cross Second Avenue
Wading in waist-high water

[Chorus 2]
And I love you so violent
More than maybe I can do

Visions,133,José González,"Visions
Trying to make sense of the now
Trying to make sense of the past
To show us how
Visions
Imagining the worlds that could be
Shaping a mosaic of fates
For all sentient beings
Visions
Cycles of growth and decay
Cascading chains of events
With no one to praise or blame
Visions
Avoidable suffering and pain
We are patiently inching our way
Toward unreachable utopias
Visions
Enslaved by the forces of nature
Elevated by mindless replicators
Challenged to steer our
collective destiny
Visions
Look at the magic of reality
While accepting with all honesty
That we can't know
for sure what's next
No we can't know
for sure what's next
But that we're in this together
We are here together
We are here together
We are here together
We are here together
We are here together"

Olympus,81,Sufjan Stevens,"Oh lift up your head boy
Don't play pretend dead on the floor
Now Harryhausen
conceived from a cauldron
Wielding Olympus with eyes
on the shore
There's nothing
There's nothing
Oh show me the flow of my life
Bound by Acrisius
bronzed from the skylight
Seeking the oracle's eyes
in the night with a sigh
Seriphos greets us
with moments of silence
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
Who will arrange my great escape
Hopelessly I have been torn
from this outrage
Tossing and turning uneasy
it cost me the cross
Am I at rest or resigned in my chaos
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away
There's no place like home
There's something
And it's the light on your hand
There's something
And it's the touch of my wristband
There's one thing
And it's the weight of our wish
There's one thing
And it's our very first kiss"

The way that they are
Out of reach
Your favorite city dreams
In violent neon scenes
Fragrant leaves
That peace that summer sleep
We almost realized
That if we appeasе
The land and the trees
The clouds and thе stars
We'd stay where we are
All the places you'll go
You'll never be alone
Always be your home
Always be your home"

Tore their world apart

Season of the fall
I’m too quietly watching
The light, white, feathered-birds of yours
Trembling like the autumn leaves
And I will be in water till through


Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loneliest dream
For whatever lives, is loneliear than the ocean
For whatever breathe, is quieter than the seashore


Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loudest fear
For the sun is not near, drowned pale through the river
For whatever is killed, is dying with the hours
For whatever is filled, is drawing hole upon holes


Rain runs through the rafter
And I could hear you cry
I’m still quietly watching
The light, white, feathered birds of yours
Trembling like the southern wind
And I will be in water till through


Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loneliest dream
For whatever lives, is loneliear than the ocean
For whatever breathe, is quieter than the seashore


Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loudest fear
For the sun is not near, drowned pale through the river
For whatever is killed, is dying with the hours

I know, you've got questions on your mind

Life is gonna happen one way or the other

Whether you like it or not

Stop looking for the answers, and you'll find

What you've got""

When you grow up, you'll be fine

I know, you've got questions on your mind

Life is gonna happen one way or the other

Whether you like it or not

Stop looking for the answers, and you'll find

What you've got"

Heartstopper,23,Anthony Lazaro,"I love the way
You put on your dress
While the scent of the night
Still floats in the air
I love the time
We spend on the road
Looking for answers
Answers to questions
We don't even know
But most of all
I love the way
We're floating in silence
Drifting in words
We don't need to say
You enter the room
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The bravest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
And I love the wallpaper
Of this cheap hotel
The fan's stuck like us
Running in circles
Lost in a spell
And I love the way
The haze can be broken
By the sudden rain
Leaving us drenched
Laughing and soaking
But most of all
I love the way
We're floating in silence
Drifting in words
We don't need to say
You enter the room
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The bravest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
You entered my life
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The sweetest heartstopper
That I've ever seen"

The Day That I Met You,17,Matilda Mann,"They telephoned me just to say
That nobody had the time for yesterday
And all at once, I felt so small
Started feeling like nobody cared at all
But then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
(Mm-mm, mm-mm)
The people talk, it's background noise
I don't wanna hear nobody else's voice
There's something sweet about your scent
It's like lavender came and never left
And then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
(Mm-mm)
Nothing ever seemed to go right
All my days, they just fell into nights
Until I got a little bit of you in my life
And then, suddenly, everything's bright
I know that there's a million different ways I could say
How you're always the best part of my day
And when you feel the need to forget the world
You can call anytime you want
Call anytime you want
(Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm)"

I Know You Won't,832,Carrie Underwood,"I know you don't mean to be
mean to me
Cuz when you want to
you can make me feel
like we belong
We belong
Lately you make me
feel all I am
is a back up plan
I say I'm Done
and then you smile at me
and I forget
everything I said
I buy into those eyes
and into your lies
You say you'll call
but I know you
You say you're coming home
but I know you
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
I wish you were
where you're supposed to be
close to me
But here I am just staring
at this candle
burning out
A stumbled sound
of foot steps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere
You say you'll call
but I know you
You say you're coming home
but I know you
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
You say you'll call
but I know you won't

You say you'll call
but I know you
You say you're coming home
but I know you
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
You say you'll call
but I know you won't"

The Look Of Love (Album Version),38,Shelby Lynne,"The look of love is in your eyes
The look your heart can't disguise
The look of love is saying so much more
Than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well, it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Look of love is on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start
Of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go, don't ever go
I love you so"
Leave,"1,004",Glen Hansard,"I can't wait forever is all that you said
Before you stood up
And you won't disappoint me
I can do that myself
But I'm glad that you've come
Now if you don't mind
Leave leave
And free yourself at the same time
Leave leave
I don't understand
you've already gone
And I hope you feel better
Now that it's out
What took you so long
And the truth has a habit
Of falling out of your mouth
But now that it's come
If you don't mind
Leave leave
And please yourself at the same time
Leave leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you came to now
Leave leave
Leave leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave leave"
Tonight I Wanna Cry,558,Keith Urban,"Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned
down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and
I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could
have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away

I've never been the kind
to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong
meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes Tonight I wanna cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me
hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old
yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way -"
Promises Like Pie-Crust,111,Carla Bruni,"Promise me no promises,

So will I not promise you:

Keep we both our liberties,

Never false and never true:

Let us hold the die uncast,

Free to come as free to go:

For I cannot know your past,

And of mine what can you know?



You, so warm, may once have been

Warmer towards another one:

I, so cold, may once have seen

Sunlight, once have felt the sun:

Who shall show us if it was

Thus indeed in time of old?

Fades the image from the glass,

And the fortune is not told.



If you promised, you might grieve

For lost liberty again:

If I promised, I believe

I should fret to break the chain.

Let us be the friends we were,

Nothing more but nothing less:

Many thrive on frugal fare

Who would perish of excess."
Hey Stephen,643,Taylor Swift,"Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls
tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one
waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen
boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it
if you look like an angel
Can't help it
if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
Hey Stephen
I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all so I thought
But I never seen
nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk
way you say my name
It's beautiful wonderful
don't you ever change
Hey Stephen
why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same
'Cause I can't help it
if you look like an angel
Can't help it
if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
They're dimming the street lights
you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now
so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine shine shine
Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
well they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it
if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it
if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself"
You're Not Sorry,765,Taylor Swift,"All this time i was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been givin out
chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby
But i figured you out
And you think it would be fine again
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that
you're sorry
But i don't believe you baby
Like i did before
You're not sorry
Oh no no no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you
if i didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waitin
in the cold
And you got to share your secrets
And i'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked
each time before
But you don't have to
call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can
tell me that you're sorry
But i don't believe you baby
Like i did before
You're not sorry
No no oh
You're not sorry
No no oh

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never
would have gone away no
You used to shine so bright
But watched our love fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can
tell me that you're sorry
But i don't believe you baby
Like i did before
You're not sorry
No no oh
You're not sorry
No no oh
No no no no no no no no
No no no no"
The Way I Loved You,858,Taylor Swift,"He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are
jealous He says everything
I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful
tonight And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and
I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act
insane And that's the way I
loved you Breakin' down
and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel
that much And that's
the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly
when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your
name You're so in love
that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel
that much And that's
the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling
anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated got away
by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting
and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could
feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you

Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you"
Forever & Always,742,Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time

I believe it was a tuesday

When i caught your eye

We caught onto something

I hold onto the night

You looked me in the eye

And told me you loved me



Were you just kidding?



Cause it seems to me

This thing is breaking down

We almost never speak

I don`t feel welcome anymore

Baby what happened

Please tell me cause one second it was perfect

Now you`re halfway out the door



And i stare, at the phone

He still, hasn`t called

And you feel so low you can`t feel, nothing at all

And you flashback to when he said

Forever and always



Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong

It rains when you`re here and it rains when you`re gone

Cause i was there when you said

Forever and always



Was i out of line? did i say something way to honest?

Did you run and hide like a scared little boy?

I looked into your eyes, thought i knew you for a minute

Now i`m not so sure"
Someday When I Stop Loving You,19,Carrie Underwood,"One foot on the bus 'bout half past nine

I knew that you were leaving this time

I thought about laying down in it's path

Thinking that you might get off for that



I remember that night we laid in bed

Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet

One for your grandma and one for mine

Said we'd draw straws when it came time



I'll move on baby, just like you

When the desert floods and the grass turns blue

When a sailing ship don't need her moon

It'll break my heart, but I'll get through

Someday When I Stop Loving You



I bet all I had on a thing called love

I guess in the end, it wasn't enough

And it's hard to watch you leave right now

I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow

Somehow



I'll move on baby, just like you

When the desert floods and the grass turns blue

When a sailing ship don't need her moon

It'll break my heart, but I'll get through

Someday when I stop loving you



Oooh, oh someday



Oh, someday



I'll move on baby, just like you

When the desert floods and the grass turns blue

When a sailing ship don't need her moon

It'll break my heart, but I'll get through

Someday when I stop loving you

Someday when I stop loving you"
Leaving On A Jet Plane,15,John Denver,"All my bags are packed I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

Guitar Solo

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Close your eyes I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go

Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go"
Innocent,836,Taylor Swift,"I guess you really did it
this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to
get it back
Wasn't it easier in your
lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful
when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you
It's all right just wait and see
Your string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've been
You're still an innocent

You're still an innocent

There's some things
you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live
it all again
You wouldn't be shattered
on the floor now
If only you would sing
what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your
firefly catchin' days
And everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down
to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin'
wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up
to you
It's all right
just wait and see
Your string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never to late to
Be brand new

It's all right
just wait and see
Your string of lights are still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost never to like to
get it back"
Grade 8,595,Ed Sheeran,"My mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red

We're not done yet

If we can ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh I`ll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around
so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
You're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade 8
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off

And never ever let you down
Now you're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade 8
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off
of the ground
And never ever let you down down
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow
For my weary head to
lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is
my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me
to the edge again
Now I see it in
your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around

The City,456,Ed Sheeran,"This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by
when it’s late
Sirens bleed
through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control
what I’m into
This tower is alive
the lights that blind
keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
sleep fills my mind
Can’t control what I'm into
London calls me a stranger
a traveller
This is now my home my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
and puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
And the shop across
the road fulfils my needs
and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me
a stranger a traveller
This is now
my home my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive
The traffic stops and starts
but I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
then that makes two"
Invisible,170,Adhitia Sofyan,"Traffic jam city streets forget about the rest
Your sanity will be put to the test
Client call repeatedly they want another change
Some idiots just can’t make up their minds
Well I would if you want to go
Just sail away from this madness
Where we will remain invisible
I wonder if what future holds will never gonna come
We’re sitting here waiting like a fool
Photographs I stumbled on they scattered on the floor
They’re memories that haunt you from it’s grave
Well I would if you want to go
Just fly away from this madness
Where we will remain invisible
Global warming’s the thing now everybody’s in
If you’re not green you better not be seen
Armageddon crystal ball Jesus reappears
They’re prophecies of world comes to an end
Well I would if you want to go
Just disappear from this madness
Yeah I would if you want to go
Where we will remain invisible"

You,649,Keaton Henson,"If you must wait
Wait for them here in my arms as I shake
If you must weep
Do it right here in my bed as I sleep
If you must mourn my love
Mourn with the moon
and the stars up above
If you must mourn
Don't do it alone
If you must leave
Leave as though fire burns
under your feet
If you must speak
Speak every word as though
it were unique
If you must die sweetheart
Die knowing your life
was my life's best part
And if you must die
Remember your life
You are
You are
Oh you are
You are
Oh
If you must fight
Fight with yourself
and your thoughts in the night
If you must work
Work to leave some
part of you on this earth
If you must live darling one
Just live
Just live
Just live"

Let every shade of
my true colors show
Keep loving me and
I'll lose all control
Eventually
Never wanna be
never wanna be that girl
With a million needs
who keeps running your world
Boy do you lie
when you say I look good tonight
I see a mess in the mirror
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody
coming out all wrong
But you hear a song you hear a song
They keep talking
All the ghost from the past
Heart broken
Can't get over it fast
Just give it up stays around
And it never leaves
I see a mess in the mirror
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody
coming out all wrong
But you hear a song you hear a song
A one note symphony Baby come on
And sing it back to me
I see a mess in the mirror
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
It sounds like the chaos
I hear in my head
All night long but you hear a song
You hear a song
You hear a song

Greatest Lovers,136,Luke Sital-Singh,"I can feel on my skin
all the hours we put in
Since my mind met your mind
I can see up ahead
there's the mountain where you'll say
you are mine you are mine
You feel the flames getting close to your face
And i'm scared of the deepest night
These winter trees
they are dancing with dreams
in their branches for you and i
We'll become We'll become
The greatest lovers The greatest lovers
We'll become We'll become
The greatest lovers
The greatest love the world has ever seen
I can see a rushing river
running from here to forever
Hold on tight we'll float together
And we'll know we're alright
Oh and once the moon's arisen
We'll have light to climb the mountain
We'll be old and stronger within
I am yours and you are mine
We'll become We'll become
The greatest lovers The greatest lovers
We'll become We'll become
The greatest lovers
The greatest love the world has ever seen
You feel the flames getting close to your face
And i'm scared of the deepest night
These winter trees
they are dancing with dreams
in their branches for you and i
We'll become We'll become
The greatest lovers The greatest lovers
We'll become We'll become
The greatest lovers
The greatest love the world has ever seen
the world has ever seen"
Drunk,523,Ed Sheeran,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make up, lip sticks to me
So now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me
Should I, should I
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I, should I
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"
The Gambler,136,Kenny Rogers,"On a warm summer's eve
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us, he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind me sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his faced lost all expression
He said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right

You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep""

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
And in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep

You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

You've got to know when to hold 'em
(When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em
(When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done"
Neon Light,82,Blake Shelton,"'Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round
cranking up a little country
gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more
missin' you I can take
I prayed prayed prayed
For a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time damn time
There's a neon light at the end
of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright but
even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright
gonna make it a double
There's a neon light at the end
of the tunnel tunnel tunnel
I take a shot of I don't care
what you're doing now
Chase that one with
a cold screw you
When that's done I just might
wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar bar bar
See if she wants to try and
break my heart heart heart
There's a neon light at the end
of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright but
even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright
gonna make it a double
There's a neon light at the end
of the tunnel tunnel tunnel
When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than
the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest
just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break
got down on my knees
And I prayed prayed prayed
For a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time damn time
There's a neon light at the end
of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright but
even though it's subtle

Break Up In A Small Town,"1,189",Sam Hunt,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that
she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
For a while I guess they were keeping it low key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that
she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, that guy but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that
she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town"
Stand by Me (Live at the Late Show with David Letterman),236,Tracy Chapman,"When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling, stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh Stand
Stand by me

If the sky we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Oh and the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Oh darling, darling, stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble you just stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand
Stand by me
Stand by me

Oh darling darling stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me"
I Used To Know,470,Alvin Ordonez,"I used to know
What it felt like to be loved
But now I don't know if I can ever feel
this way again because I
Thought that I had found the one
The one that I could wake up
with knowing
That everything would be just fine
When the morning breaks
And the sunlight takes
the lonely nights away
That's when I'd come to realize
that we've just added oh
Just one more day
To the history in the making
The feelings that you were faking
It's getting old I've been told
I used to know
What it meant to be yourself
But I was too blind
To see that you would rather
be with someone else
But still I thought that
I had just one more shot oh no
Too bad I didn't realize
I set myself up for one more fall
When the morning breaks
And the sunlight takes
the lonely nights away
That's when I'd come to realize
that we've just added oh
Just one more day
To the history in the making
The feelings that you were faking
It's getting old I've been told
I used to know
That when the music stops
The only beats will be
coming from our hearts
But how can that be
when you tore it apart
Like it was just a game
Oh no it'll never be the
same anymore I'm sure
So don't come running back to me
When you change your mind
just one more time
Oh I decided I gots to draw the line
Somewhere somehow
that time it is now
Ain't no stopping me
from moving on
Because it's time to stop
your playing girl
Cause now you're just a girl
I used to know
I used to know
I used to know
I used to know
I used to know"
Lately,144,Dan + Shay,"Lately, it's been hard to breath
Just trying to keep my head above water
Sometimes life's in the way, all work and no play
And lately, it's been hard to see the way you used to be
And I wonder, if the words I don't say
Can make it okay

But I've been thinking bout us
And I know that the going is rough
And it feels like a little too much
Maybe I don't say it enough
So listen

Girl you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it
Still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
That I get to call you mine
So baby have I told you that I love you
Lately

Baby we can stay at home
Or ditch the phone
Don't have to go nowhere
And get lost in your eyes
Let the time fly by
Baby, it don't matter what tomorrow brings
You know I'll be right there
Today and tonight, the rest of my life

I've been thinking bout us
And I know the going is rough
And it feels like a little too much
Maybe I don't say it enough

Girl you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it
Still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
That I get to call you mine
So baby have I told you that I love you
Lately

Oh yeah
Have I told you
Lately
Ooh mmm

Have I told that I love you
That you're funny that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you? Mmm
Have I told you?

Girl you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down, it
Still drives me crazy
You're beautiful
Gonna tell you all the time
Cause when you let your hair down, it
Still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
I can't believe that you're all mine
So baby have I told you you that I love you
Lately

Have I told you that I love you
That you're funny, that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Lately

Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you?
Have I told you?

Stolen Dance,293,Twin Bandit,"I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away
from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
Never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
We don't talk about it
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
We don't talk about it
We don't talk about it
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
Never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
We don't talk about it
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long

Missing (Acoustic Sessions),339,Seafret,"You try to get back
how it used to be
Searching for truth
in the words I speak
But the message is blurred
and never quite complete
How you look in my eyes
I know you deserve more
Reflections in the water help
to clear my mind
Stretching out before me
to the other side
We didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye
Give me something to live for
something to die for
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
Is it something I'm not
not seeing
Is it not enough just just being
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
Ooh ooh
Well I don't know what you need
when I'm so unprepared
Tell me what is a life
if it is not shared
I keep falling asleep pretending
that you're there
You gave me something to live for
something to die for
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
Is it something I'm not
not seeing
Is it not enough just
just being
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
I'm missing
Oooh
Oooh
'Cause I feel it
Yes I feel it now
Yes I feel it
Yes I feel it now
You get what you deserve
leave it in the dirt
All of that work
and you're breaking it
breaking it
And it only gets worse
leave it in the dirt
All of that work
and you're breaking it
breaking me down
Why are you breaking me
breaking me down
Why are you breaking me
breaking me down
Is there something that I'm
I'm missing
Not matter how hard I try
you're not listening
There must be something
that I'm I'm missing"

Trailer Trash,70,carolesdaughter,"I've seen friends turn to
junkies with no purpose
out of money
Can I spend the night
I really need to crash
My shit is gone at a pawnshop
Fucking tweaker took my laptop
Burned a bridge for
some dope and some cash
I'm trailer trash
drunk off my ass
And my savings went to liquor
so I'm all out of cash
I'm living fast I hate my past
And my shoes are old and ugly
but they still seem to last
My stomach always
seems to toss and turn
Drink so much
my organs start to burn
I need some light
to write this song
But I forgot the pay the bill again
this night's gon' be long
Money can't fix a damn thing
I don't want to cry so I sing
I don't really
have no change to spare
Some people do but life isn't fair
I'm trailer trash
drunk off my ass
And my savings went to liquor
so I'm all out of cash
I'm living fast I hate my past
And my shoes are old and ugly
but they still seem to last
Change is never
something that I want
I've been here for years
this place will always haunt
My baby is gone
out of my life
I pretended I don't miss her
I don't know wrong from right
I'm trailer trash
drunk off my ass
And my savings went to liquor
so I'm all out of cash
I'm living fast I hate my past
And my shoes are old and ugly
but they still seem to last
I don't wash my clothes
at the laundromat
'Cause my best friend's got a washer
so I just fiend off that
I'm trailer trash"

Witness,50,Luca,"It made sense in the moment
No sense in a lone body
There's a lesson I know it
I confess that I ain't sorry

Same lens out of focus
Take the blame put it all on me
In a daze we've been holding
To more or less a memory

And all at once
I feel it rising underneath
And all I want, is some time, define me
I'm a witness and you, showed me love
It was only us and we were one
Was it all for nothing

Now I'm done done, done done done
Done done done done done done
Done done, done done done

Without a silent emotion
I've been hiding away lonely
Get me out in the open
Somewhere in reality

I'll take a light where I'm going
I know I've been out of reach
Think we already know it
It's a lesson in love I need

And all at once
I feel it rising underneath
And all I want, is some time, define me
I'm a witness and you, showed me love
It was only us and we were one
Was it all for nothing"

cherry blossom,40,Kacey Musgraves,"Early April you walked up to me
Changing colors on city streets
Petals surrounding us in every shade of pink
We happened quickly, as humans do
Summer was coming, and change was too
Look at me now, I'm fallin' at your feet

[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
I don't wanna blow away

[Verse 2]
When we're on fire, it's something to see
No one can question the chemistry
Even in nature, timing is everything

[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
Yeah, I'm your cherry blossom, baby
I don't wanna blow away

Stoned at the Nail Salon,36,Lorde,"Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

[Chorus]
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail salon again

[Verse 2]
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

[Chorus]
'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen you'll grow out of
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

[Bridge]
Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know

Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again"
White Winter Hymnal,52,Fleet Foxes,"I was following the, I was following the
I was following the, I was following the
I was following the, I was following the
I was following the, I was following the

Chorus
I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertime

Chorus
I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertime

Diabetes,6,Amanda Ong,"I think I’ll be fine
What’s the worst thing they’ll say?
It can’t be that bad,
I’ve been feeling okay
I’m not dying today
I remember when
They gave me the news
It’s been a few years
More than just a few tears
But I still feel the blues
Do I spend more money
or put more sugar inside me?
Cauliflower rice costs extra
but not the spaghetti
Like there wasn’t already
enough to worry about,
It’s not like we can sit
here all day and pout
Try being a young person
with diabetes
betes betes betes
betes betes betes
betes betes betes
I have to check my sugars
Every so often, and now I prick
My fingers bleed a little
And it really is a bit-tle
Onto a tiny gold strip?
And the number’s meant to tell me
If I’m doing well or not
Yet the doctors also tell me
Not to only trust the bot
Do I spend more money or
put more sugar inside me?
Cauliflower rice costs extra
but not the spaghetti
Like there wasn’t already
enough to worry about,
It’s not like we can sit here
all day and pout
Try being a young person
with diabetes
betes betes betes
betes betes betes
betes betes betes
Now and then I tell myself
Can’t drink like I used to
Now I’m a different me
Not who I used to be
Gotta watch what I eat or do
Don’t answer those impulses
Say yes a lot less
Honestly it’s hard
But at least my health’s not a mess
Do I spend more money or
put more sugar inside me?
Cauliflower rice costs extra
but not the spaghetti
Like there wasn’t already
enough to worry about,
It’s not like we can sit here
all day and pout
Try being a young person
with diabetes
betes betes betes
betes betes betes
betes betes betes"

Dialtone,10,Memorial,"If you need
Someone to call
I’ll be around
I know things
Haven’t gone your way
For a while

Move to the red bricks
To find a new version of yourself
Let it surface
Let it bloom

Miss your old friends
And all the shit you’d get up to
Ain’t it a shame
That what you love, you get used to

If you need
Someone to call
I’ll be around
I know things
Haven’t gone your way
For a while

You moved to your mums house
To save up for a ring
But all you spent
Was time
On the wrong things

I hope your heart mends
How can you stand to go on like this
I hope your moonless sky
Finds light again
When you finally get off those meds

If you need
Someone to call
I’ll be around
I know things
Haven’t gone your way
For a while

But that’s okay."

Verse 1
Ten miles out of Chattanooga
South of that state line
There's a no-name road off Highway 2
Just past the welcome sign
It's where I was born, it's where I was raised

But that's the place I wanna be after my last breath

Yeah, I don't care what color my suit is
Or what shoes y'all put on my feet
I don't care how many show up, yeah
Or who reads my eulogy
Just take me out to that graveyard
Sing a send me home song
Put Go Dawgs on my headstone Headstone
And pile that red dirt on

Limitless,12,Asgeir,"When you're on a crowded city street
Shouting people sirens never sleep
Take a look at the limitless outer space
When the blue grows a darker and deeper shade
And you'll surely hear the racket fade away

Everybody's on a shopping spree
Buying things that they don't really need
Take a look at the limitless outer space
When the blue grows a darker and deeper shade
And you'll simply feel the longing fade away

Lend an ear to the whisper behind machines
How it renders you wordless when stillness speaks
Take a look at the limitless outer space
When the blue grows a darker and deeper shade
And you'll clearly see the city fade away"

Save your money on the roses, baby
Just leave a daisy on the dashboard
Just pick me up in your old Bronco, baby
Don't gotta ride in on a white horse

Pre-Chorus 1
When you're younger they say it's a kiss in the rain
Throwin' rocks at a window

Chorus
But it's when we're in a crowded room, put your hand on my back
And waitin' on me in the morning with my coffee black
Back to the basics 'cause they're bigger than they seem, yeah

And when you need to give mе my space

Accidentally brushed his body
On the way to get a drink at the bar
I couldn't wait 'til later
Talking in the elevator
Then we're kissing in the back of the car

Pre-Chorus
That voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't see the way you lookin' at me right now
It may not be next week what I need
Then again, maybe it might be

Could be forever or we might break

Gotta see if this works
I gotta have it
Wake up in your t-shirt

Verse 2
Who knows what'll happen
Ain't it always kinda magic
When you don't know who's holding the cards Ah-ah
Could bе a wish I never knew ya
Or pеrmanently tattooed ya
Only the moon knows what's in the stars What's in the stars

Pre-Chorus
Mmm, that voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't feel your hands on my hips right now
It may not be next year what I need
Then again, maybe it might be

My Father's Eyes,29,Eric Clapton,"Sailing down behind the sun
Waiting for my prince to come
Praying for the healing rain
To restore my soul again

Just a toerag on the run
How did I get here
What have I done
When will all my hopes arise
How will I know him
When I look in my father's eyes

Look into my father's eyes
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
Look into my father's eyes
My father's eyes

Then the light begins to shine
And I hear those ancient lullabies
And as I watch this seedling grow
Feel my heart start to overflow

Where do I find the words to say
How do I teach him
What do we play
Bit by bit, I've realized
That's when I need them
That's when I need my father's eyes

Then the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears
I'm like a bridge that was washed away
My foundations were made of clay

As my soul slides down to die
How could I lose him
What did I try
Bit by bit, I've realized
That he was here with me
I look into my father's eyes"

close to me
And my hand still shakes
till it pours itself a drink
I still let these ghosts get the best

Wake me up
sit me down
Gimme a reason not to burn this town

in the dark yah been getting loud
Give me shelter from the rain
Tell me I’m worth more than my pain
thought I’d be somebody new
this time around
or at least be better by now
better by now
better by now
I still draw my blood
when I don’t find the words to speak
I still ask for grace
from a god I don’t believe
I still hold my tongue
even tho it’s killing me
But I still tell myself
it’s the way it’s supposed
the way it’s supposed to be
So wake me up
sit me down
Gimme a reason not to burn this town
Cuz them voices
in the dark yah been getting loud
Give me shelter from the rain
Tell me I’m worth more than my pain
thought I’d be somebody new
this time around
or at least be better by now
better by now
better by now
And these voices
And these choices
They both weigh me
Weigh me
Weigh me down
Wake me up
sit me down
Gimme a reason not to burn this town
Cuz them voices
in the dark yah been getting loud
Give me shelter from the rain
Tell me I’m worth more than my pain
thought I’d be somebody new

We go and run all down the main street
You make me feel like it’s just you and me

Said life is good, life is good

Having talks of where we’re going
Once we leave and get out of this town,
We’ll make it big one day and show them, oeh oeh

Lets own the world yeah just the two of us,
Our names, no, they won’t be forgotten
Tonight let’s act like its our last one, oeh oeh

하지만 더이상 병도 없고
고생이나 위험도 없는
That bright world To which I go
밝고 빛나는 세상을
찾아가고 있습니다

I""m going there See my father
나의 아버지를 만나기 위해
그곳으로 가고 있습니다
I""m going there No more to roam
방황이라고는 더 이상 없는
그곳으로 가고 있습니다

I""m only going Over Jordan
요단강을 건너서
가고 있습니다
I""m only going
Over Home
내 집을 찾아서
나는 그곳으로 가고 있습니다

I know dark clouds
Will gather around me
먹구름이 내 주위로
몰려올 거라는 것을 알고 있습니다
I know my way Is rough and steep
내가 가는 길은 험하고 가파를 것입니다

Yet beauteous fields lie Just before me
그렇지만 내 앞길에는
아름다운 동산이 예비되어 있습니다
Where God""s redeedmed Their vigils keep
그곳에서 주님은 우리 죄를 용서해주시고
항상 보호해 주실것입니다

I""m going there
어머니를 만나기 위해
See my mother
나는 그곳으로 가고 있습니다
She said she""d meet me
어머니는 나를 맞으면서
When I come
내가 오기를 기다렸다고 말씀하실 것입니다

Before You Accuse Me,109,Eric Clapton,"Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending
my money on other women
You've taking money
from someone else
I called your mama
Bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama
Bout three or four nights ago
Well your mama said Son
Don't call my daughter no more
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending
my money on other women
You've taking money

Come on back home baby
Try my love one more time
Come on back home baby

San Francisco Bay Blues,109,Eric Clapton,"I got the blues from my baby
left me by the San Francisco Bay
The ocean liner's gone so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad
she was the best girl
I ever have had
She said goodbye I can take a cry
I want to lay down and die
I ain't got a nickel
and I ain't got a lousy dime
She don't come back
think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever gets back to stay
it's going to be another
brand new day
Walking with my baby down
by the San Francisco Bay

Sitting down looking
from my back door
Wondering which way to go
The woman I'm so crazy about
she don't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train
'cause I'm feeling blue
And ride all the way
to the end of the line
thinking only of you
Meanwhile in another city
Just about to go insane
Thought I heard my baby Lord
the way she used to call my name
If I ever get her back to stay
it's going to be another
brand new day
Walking with my baby down
by the San Francisco Bay
Walking with my baby down
by the San Francisco Bay
Walking with my baby down
by the San Francisco Bay"
Prison Song,212,Graham Nash,"One day a friend took me a side
and said I have to leave you
For buying something from a friend
They say I have done wrong
For protecting the name of a man
they say I'll have to leave you
So now I'm bidding you farewell
for much too long
And here's a song to sing
for every man inside
If he can hear you sing
it's an open door
There's not a rich man there
who couldn't pay his way
and buy the freedom
that's a high price for the poor
Kids in Texas smoking grass
ten year sentence comes to pass
Misdemeanor in Ann Arbor
ask the judges why
Another friend said to her kids
I'm gonna have to leave you
For selling something to the man
I guess I did wrong
And although I did the best I could
I'm gonna have to leave you
So now I'm kissing you farewell
for much too long
And here's a song to sing
for every man inside
If he can hear you sing
it's an open door
There's not a rich man there
who couldn't pay his way
and buy the freedom
that's a high price for the poor"
Ballad Of Casy Deiss,103,Shawn Phillips,"Phillips

Twas a man of youthful features
Twas a boy of sorrowful eyes
Watching out but looking inward
Tall and stately and full of life

In his life he spoke but rarely
In his mind he cried for light
Painting perceptions trying to capture
That which he saw in his questioning strife

Once in Lisbon, twice in London
Travelling around for all of his time
Looking for and finding a goddess
He took Diana to be his wife

Of the children they'd begotten
Two had died without knowing life
And the third I know not whereof
But if she lives, she will yet be kind

Casey had a mark of simple value
He had a star between his eyes
In his hands he held an axe blade
The Greek symbol of thunder and fire

On a night when the heavens were crying
He went down and took his blade
Chopping wood to warm his hearthside
The lightning came and my brother die

Bring him no wine from faraway vineyards
Tell him no tales of the canyon's might
But wish him peace and eternal wisdom
For he has died and he died in light"
American Pie,111,Don McLean,"A long long time ago
I can still remember
How that music
used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make
those people dance
And maybe they'd be
happy for a while
But february made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about
his widowed bride
But something
touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So bye bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And them good old boys
were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the
day that I die
this'll be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so
have you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me
how to dance real slow
Well I know
that you're in love with him
'cause I saw you
dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage
broncin' buck
With a pink carnation
and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'
bye bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were
drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be
the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die
Now for ten years
we've been on our own
And moss grows fat
on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang
for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed
from james dean
And a voice that came
from you and me
Oh and while the king
was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while lennon
read a book of marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singing
bye bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were
drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be
the day that I die
this'll be the day that I die
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off
with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried
for a forward pass
With the jester
on the sidelines in a cast
Now the half time air
was sweet perfume
While the sergeants
played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh but we never got the chance
'cause the players
tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died
We started singing
bye bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were
drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the
day that I die
this'll be the day that I die
Oh and there
we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on
jack be nimble jack be quick
Jack flash sat on a candlestick
Cause fire is the
devil's only friend
Oh and as I watched
him on the stage
My hands were clenched
in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high
into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singing
bye bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were
drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the
day that I die
this'll be the day that I die
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her
for some happy news
But she just smiled
and turned away
I went down to the sacred story
Where I'd heard
the music years before
But the man there said
the music wouldn't play
in the streets
the children screamed
The lovers cried
and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The father son and the holy ghost
They caught the last
train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing
bye bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And them good old boys were
drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin this'll be the
day that I die
this'll be the day that I die
They were singing
bye bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were
drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin this'll be the
day that I die"
Crying,73,Don McLean,"I was all right
for a while
I could smile
for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say hello
And though you wished me well
You couldn't tell
that I'd been
Crying over you
Then you said so long
left me standing
All alone
alone and crying
Crying crying crying
it's hard to Understand
that the touch
Of your hand
can start me crying
I thought that
I was over you
But it's true so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
but darling
What can I do for you
don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying over you
yes now you're gone
And from
this moment on
I'll be crying
crying crying crying
Yeah crying crying
over you~"

Me And Bobby McGee,17,Kris Kristofferson,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded
as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
just before it rained
Took us all the way
to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out
of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowing sad
while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield
wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang up
every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for
nothing' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin'
but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord
when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was
good enough for me
Good enough for me
and Bobby McGee
From the coal mines of
Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared
the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord
through everything I've done
Every night she kept me
from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas
Lord I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home
I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows
for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body
next to mine
Freedom's just another word for
nothing' left to lose
Nothin' left is all she left for
me
Feeling good was easy Lord
when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy that was good
enough for me
Good enough for me

Bridge over Troubled Water,77,Simon & Garfunkel,"When you're weary
feeling small
when tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
oh when times get rough
And friend just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down.

When you're down and out
when you're on the street
when evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
oh when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down.

Sail on silver girl,
sail on by
your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
oh if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll ease your mind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll ease your mind."
Shelter From The Storm,80,Bob Dylan,"'Twas in another lifetime
one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
a creature void of form
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

And if I pass this way again
you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death
and men who are fighting to be warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Not a word was spoke between us
there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
where it's always safe and warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

I was burned out from exhaustion
buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
ravaged in the corn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Suddenly I turned around
and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
and took my crown of thorns
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Now there's a wall between us
somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
on an uneventful morn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails
and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
he blows a futile horn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

I've heard newborn babies
wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth
stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man
is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

In a little hilltop village
they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
I got repaid with scorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country
but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
to when God and her were born
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm"
We'll Meet Again,176,Johnny Cash,"We'll meet again

Time Has Told Me,206,Nick Drake,"Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind.

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore.

So I`ll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love.

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn.

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say.

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'til there's no more to hide.

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love.

Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind.

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shore."
How to Dream,37,Sam Phillips,"When we open our eyes and dream

We open our eyes

When we open our eyes and dream

We open our eyes

Under normal, we change the wind

Facing every direction

Planted in the future, we live two lives

All to reveal a secret we can't hide

When we open our eyes and dream

We open our eyes

When we open our eyes and dream

We open our eyes

We search the sky, planets chasing the stars

Pulling toward deep affection

Weights and numbers measure a wound that won't heal

All to reveal a secret we can't hide

When we open our eyes and dream

We open our eyes

When we open our eyes and dream

We open our eyes"
The Messiah Will Come Again,469,Roy Buchanan,"Just a smile
Just a glance
The Prince of Darkness
he just walked past

There's been a lot of people
they've had a lot to say
But this time
I'm gonna tell it my way

There was a town
It was a strange little town
they called the world
It was a lonely
lonely little town
Till one day a stranger appeared
Their hearts rejoicied
and this sad little town was
happy again

But there were some that doubted
They disbelieved,so they mocked Him
And the stranged He went away
and the said little town that
was sad yesterday
It's a lot sadder today
I walked in a lot of places
I never should have been
But I know that the Messiah
He will come again"
Times Like These,269,Jack Johnson,"In times like these,
In times like those,
What will be will be,
And so it goes...

There's always been laughing, crying,
Birthing, dying.
Boys and girls with hearts a-taken,
Give and break.
Heal and grow and recreate.
And raise and nurture,
But there not from time to...

Times like these,
Times like those,
What will be will be,
And so it goes...

And there's always been stop and go,
And fast and slow,
And action, reaction,
Sticks and stones
And broken bones,
Those for peace and those for war,
God bless these ones, not those ones, but these ones...
Man...

Times like these,
Times like those,
What will be will be,
And so it goes...

And it always goes
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on it goes...
Mmmmm....mmmmmm..."

You'll Think Of Me,16,Keith Urban,"I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishin' I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah

And you're gonna think of me
Oh someday baby, someday"
Break Down Here,19,Julie Roberts,"Mile marker 203, the gas gauge leanin' on the edge of ""E"",
An' I'll be dang'd if the rain ain't pourin' down.
There's somethin' smokin' underneath the hood,
It's a-bangin' and a-clangin' an' it can't be good,
An' it's another fifty miles to the nearest town.
Everythin' I own's in the back in a hefty bag;
I'm outta cigarettes an' I'm down to my last drag.

I'd sure hate to break down here,
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
I'd sure hate to break down here.

Under fifty thousand miles ago,
Before the bad blood an' busted radio,
He said I was all he had ever needed.
But love is blind an' little did I know,
You were just another dead end road,
Made with pretty lies an' broken dreams.
Baby, leavin' you is easier than bein' gone.
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong.

I'd sure hate to break down here,
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
An' I'd sure hate to break down here.
Oh, no.

I'd sure hate to break down here,
With nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
An' I'd sure hate to break down,
It's too late to turn around.
I'd sure hate to break down here."
How Do You Get That Lonely,4,Blaine Larsen,"It was just another story written on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home
Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun?
Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol?
Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son?
Did no one see the writing on the wall?
I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20, but I still don't understand...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
It was just another story printed on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score..."
Misty Roses,11,Tim Hardin,"You look to me like misty roses
Too soft to touch
But too lovely to leave alone
If I could be like misty roses
I love you much
You're too lovely to leave alone

Flowers often cry
But too late to find
That their beauty has been lost
With their peace of mind
You look to me like love forever
Too good to last
But too lovely not to try
If I believe in love forever
I'd forget the past
You're too lovely
Not to try"
I Felt My Life With Both My Hands,41,Carla Bruni,"I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there
I held my spirit to the glass
To prove it possibler

I turned my being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the owner's name
For doubt that I should know the sound
To ask the owner's name
For doubt that I should know the sound

I judged my features, jelled my hair
I pushed my dimples by
And waited if they twinkled back
Conviction might of me

I turned my being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the owner's name
For doubt that I should know the sound
To ask the owner's name
For doubt that I should know the sound

I told myself take courage, friend
That was a former time
But we might learn to like the Heaven
As well as our old home

I turned my being round and round and round
Paused at every pound
To ask the owner's name
For doubt that I should know the sound
To ask the owner's name
For doubt that I should know the sound

I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there"
Carmensita,16,Devendra Banhart,"Ay tu primo colorado, con barba camburada
Y lleno de ballena inclinandose al sol
Tu rayo de luz roja, besando nuestra boca
El beso que te sopla huele al col

Ay tus tres ojos lunares extraterrestriales
Entran cuando sales, por eso y no se ven
Ay tu barba colorada traviesa y rebelde
Me afeito con espada, pero devuelve!

Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Si la noche te persigue entregate a ella
O dile que tienes dolor de cabeza
Sombrita de reflejo, dame algo tierno
Me como tu amor y cago el infierno

Ay, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ay, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Berno, oh, oh, berne, berne, berne, oh, oh
Ah, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Ay tus ojos colorados azul y anaranjados
Amarillo y verde y maron
Mi amor envuelto en tu corazon

No lo sueltes por favor
Somos elefantes y serpientes semejantes
Tomando agua ardiente en el sol

En el sol, en el sol, en el sol
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Let It Grow,101,Eric Clapton,"Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs

To tell me which way I should go to find the answer,

And all the time I know,

Plant your love and let it grow.



Let it grow, let it grow,

Let it blossom, let it flow,

In the sun, the rain, the snow,

Love is lovely, let it grow.



Looking for a reason to check out of my mind,

Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on,

But there’s nothing left to show,

Plant your love and let it grow.



Let it grow, let it grow,

Let it blossom, let it flow,

In the sun, the rain, the snow,

Love is lovely, let it grow.



This is getting shorter and there’s much for you to do.

Only ask and you will get what you are needing,

The rest is up to you.

Plant your love and let it grow.



Let it grow, let it grow,

Let it blossom, let it flow,

In the sun, the rain, the snow,

Love is lovely, let it grow.



Let it grow, let it grow,

Let it blossom, let it flow,

In the sun, the rain, the snow,

Love is lovely, let it grow."
Breathe (Feat. Colbie Caillat),916,Taylor Swift,"I see your face in my mind as
I drive away
Cause none of us thought
it was gonna end that way
People are people
and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go
after all this time

Music starts playin
like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't
really wanna see
Cause it's tragedy and
it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be
without you around
And we know it's never
simple never easy
Never a clean break
no one here to save me
You're the only thing
I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe
Without you but I have to
Breathe
Without you but I have to

Never wanted this
never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road
I tried to swerve
People are people and
sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna
save us from the fall out
And we know it's never
simple never easy
Never a clean break
no one here to save me
You're the only thing
I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe
Without you but I have to
Breathe
Without you but I have to

It's two a m
feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy
easy for me
It's two a m
feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy
easy for me
And we know it's never
simple never easy
Never a clean break
no one here to save me oh
I can't breathe
Without you but I have to

Without you but I have to
Breathe
Without you but I have to

The Story (Album Version),246,Zee Avi,"Broken dreams broken dreams
Hoping someday you'll see me
Sky is grey sky is grey
But I'm dancing in the rain
Live to sway live to sway
When you remember my name
Live a lie live a lie
Well don't you ask yourself why
Don't you open your eyes
Only the moon only the moon
only the moon
Will hear my plea
Only the creatures of the night
Will harmonize with me
Miss you so miss you so
And I wondered if you know
The wind is blowing
on the end of this corner
And it's hard to let go
That's story
That's the story of you and me
That's the story
That's the story of you and me"

SuperStar,745,Taylor Swift,"This is wrong
But I can't help but feel like
There aint nothin' more right babe
Misty morning comes again
and I can't Help but wish
I could see your face
And I knew from the first note
played I'd be breaking
all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight
Tell me things like I can't take
my eyes Off of you
I'm no one special
Just another wide eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall Superstar

Morning loneliness comes around
when I'm not Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be Counting down
the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front
Row scream your name
So dim that spotlight
Tell me things like I can't take
my eyes Off of you
I'm no one special
Just another wide eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall Superstar

You played in bars you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone
knows who you are And you'll never
see you sing me to sleep
Every night on the radio
So dim that spotlight
Tell me things like I can't take
my eyes Off of you
I'm no one special
Just another wide eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall Superstar
Sweet sweet superstar superstar"
I Run To You (Dave Bascombe Mix),433,Lady Antebellum,"I run from hate

I run from prejudice

I run from pessimists

But I run too late

I run my life

Or is it running me

Run from my past

I run too fast

Or too slow it seems

When lies become the truth

That's when I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster

Into a new disaster so I run to you

I run to you baby

And when it all starts coming undone

Baby you're the only one I run to

I run to you



We run on fumes

Your life and mine

Like the sands of time

Slippin' right on through

And our love's the only truth

That's why I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster

Into a new disaster so I run to you

I run to you baby

And when it all starts coming undone

Baby you're the only one I run to

I run to you



This world keeps spinning faster

Into a new disaster so I run to you

I run to you baby

And when it all starts coming undone

Baby you're the only one I run to

I run to you

I run to you



I run to you

I always run to you"
Laredo,25,Band Of Horses,"Gonna take a trip to Laredo
Gonna take a dip in the lake
Oh, I'm at a crossroads with myself
I don't got no one else

And possibilities at the door
I won't be needing them anymore
Oh, is this the first time in your life?
It's hard just to get by

But oh, my love, don't you even know?
And oh, my love, are you really gone?
Ooooh

And can you see the world through a window?
Are you having troubles in droves?
Oh, I think the worst thing I could do
Is get back home to you

I put a bullet in my Kia Lorenzo
A kitchen knife fucked in my face
Throw me in the deep of Jenner Lake
Believe me when I say

That oh, my love, you don't even call
And oh, my love, is that you on the phone?
Ooooh

...

And oh, my love, you don't even know
That oh, my love, are you really gone?
Ooooh"

Take On Me,293,Ely Bruna,"na na na na na na na



We′re talking away

I don′t know what

I′m to say I′ll say it anyway

Today′s another day to find you

Shying away

I′ll be coming for your love, OK



Take on me, take me on

I′ll be gone In a day or two





So needless to say

I′m odds and ends

But that′s me stumbling away

Slowly learning that life is OK

Say after me

It′s no better to be safe than sorry



Take on me, take me on

I′ll be gone In a day or two





the things that you say

Is it life or

Just a play my worries away

You′re all the things

I′ve got to remember

You′re shying away

I′ll be coming for you anyway



Take on me, take me on

I′ll be gone In a day or two

Say You'll Stay,478,Melissa Polinar,"Theres something in the air
A whisper in my ear
And I cant get it out of my mind
Maybe these butterflies are
trying to tell us
Theres something here
that we need to find
I dont know what love
is up to these days
But it sure seems
like its hanging around
Say you'll stay
Even though we dont know
what this is all about
Guess well just have to wait
cause what we are
we will eventually figure out
All I know is
that I want to be next to you
And right now theres room
for the world
So wont you stay
Please say you'll stay
Dont you run away just
because youre afraid
of something
that feels out of control
we can take our time
just give it a try
cause theres no harm
in taking it slow
We dont know what love
is up to these days
But it sure seems
like its hanging around
Say you'll stay
Even though we dont know
what this is all about
Guess well just have to wait
cause what we are
we will eventually figure out
All I know is
that I want to be next to you
And right now theres room
for the world
So wont you stay
Please say
Live each moment
Love every minute
Take every second by the hand
We dont have to worry
There isnt any hurry
Its all going to work out
in the end
in the end
We dont know what love

But it sure seems
like its hanging around
Say you'll stay

And I throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I throw it all away
Watch you fall, now
You are the earth I will stand upon
You are the words I will sing

Watched you fall into his arms again

Mine (Live From Chicago / 2011),495,Taylor Swift,"Ohh oh oh oh oh
You were in college working
part time waiting tables
Left a small town
never looked back
I was the flight risk
with the fear of fallin’
Wonderin’ why we bothered
with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As we’re lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes yes I can see it now
Do you remember we were
sittin’ there by the water
You put your arm around
me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing
that’s ever been mine
Flash forward and we’re
taking on the world together
And there’s a drawer of
my things at your place
You learned
my secrets and you figure out
why I’m guarded
You say we’ll never make
my parents’ mistakes
But we’ve got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take yes yes
This is what I thought about
Do you remember we were
sitting there by the water
You put your arm
around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing
that’s ever been mine
Do you remember
all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to
believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless
man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing
that’s ever been mine
Woah oh ohh
And I remember
that fight 2 30 AM
Cause everything was
slippin’ right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you
followed me out into the street
Braced myself
for the goodbye
Cause that’s all
I’ve ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said I’ll never
leave you alone
You said
I remember how we
felt sittin’ by the water
And every time I look at you
it’s like the first time
I fell in love with a careless
man’s careful daughter
She is the best thing
that’s ever been mine
Oh oh Make it last
Hold on Never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless
man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing
that’s ever been mine
Woah oh
Yeah yeah Do you believe it
Woah oh
We’re gonna make it now
Woah oh
And I can see it yeah yeah

Love Is A Wild Thing,280,Kacey Musgraves,"You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to

[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

[Verse 2]
Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

[Bridge]
I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no

[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah"
Slow Train,94,Brian Dunne,"Honey I'm so tired
I just want to ride easy on a slow train

And the tremble in my fingers
And the cocaine
Honey I'm so tired
And I wanna ride easy on a slow train
Oh yea

My love, do you feel me
This wasn't how I really saw it turning out
But everywhere I turn
A dream that used to burn
Is always burning out
I can't hear another question
Or learn another lesson for the ones that I've learned always turned out less than I asked
Baby I'm sinking down fast

Honey I'm so tired

Ah swear it was just right here
But now I don't know where it went

My love do you hear me
You're lying right near me
But you're so far gone
And I'm so far from home
And I don't know where we're going
Down the road we're on
I've known people at the bottom going straight to the top
I've known people that were lucky
But I am not
But no
I guess it's not who I am

Honey I'm so tired
I just want to ride easy on a slow train
I ain't got a nickel
Honey, I ain't got a dime

The Days,19,Will Fox,"You ask me how are the days I spend with my only true love
And I tell you she shows me the summer with snow clouds above

You ask me how are the nights I spend with my only true baby
And I tell you she shows me the light

When my darkest hour shades me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same

You ask me how are the days now that my baby is gone
I’m troubled my friend, I know what is right but I do what is wrong

You ask me how are the nights now that my true love has left me
Well I drink and I dream of her still

But her vision, it only breaks me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same

When my darkest hour shades me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same

No it ain't the same"

Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt

Hear the same songs in my car

I remember how bad I need ya Need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
Ooh"
Kaitlin,67,Angelo De Augustine,"Mother left you in the night
My father faded into the same light
Now we're both hoping to find someone

[Verse 2]
I hope you hear this song
And you leave your old boyfriend
Come back where you belong
In my arms

[Chorus]
Kaitlin, Kaitlin
Kaitlin, Kaitlin

[Verse 3]
All of the days and the nights
You and I and a dream in Ojai
Filling up both of our lives
With love

[Verse 4]
Sometimes you're like the wind
Like my mother sang in 1987
Now your life's sure to begin

[Chorus]
Kaitlin, Kaitlin
Kaitlin, Kaitlin

[Bridge]
All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll choose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love

[Verse 5]
Now you're gone again
I gave all that I had to give
But I lost my friend

[Verse 6]
Just before the holiday
Unable to learn my own name
Or blow the wind away
What would you say

[Chorus]
Kaitlin, Kaitlin
Kaitlin, Kaitlin

[Outro]
All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll choose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love"
All Your Life,175,Angelo De Augustine,"Thought I'd go and leave
Anyway
Time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life


You can't believe
That a match dipped
In gasoline
Has the power to lift
You from this dream
One I thought to leave

Now I'll go and lead
Anyway time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life


All the pills were green
And I swallowed them inside a sea
Of mercury
Then the fire came and burned your mind
And drowned you deep
When I thought to leave

Anyway time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life

The noose was clean
As I swung it on the blade on high
The fan did gleam
And it's revolutions turned my mind
Back indeed
When I thought to leave

Anyway time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life"
"Rocky Mountain High (Live at the Palladium, London, UK - April 1976)",3,John Denver,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the strings are already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high high Colorado
Rocky Mountain high high Colorado

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high high Colorado
Rocky Mountain high high Colorado

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high high Colorado
Rocky Mountain high high Colorado"
I Make Sparks,310,Novo Amor,"I make sparks
In awesome ways
The dripping tap
Consuming my head

Yeah you took off
With little conflict in your way
And I'm not good at winning fights anymore
I'm just a needle in the hay

I emptied out
The contents of my case and stayed a while
The heavy load I bore I wait a while
And bare the swelling of my curse

But I gave ground
A bit of shove so you would see
I won't be biting at my tongue anymore
I could be catching up on sleep

I made a b-line up to the gate
Met with your eyes and it was appalling
We took a rest sitting on our feet
These are the memories I keep

We made the law but it shook the ground
Keeping it working was everything
That would keep it from all going down

And you're set up
And I lie down
And you're set up
And I lie down"

Rosie,29,Passenger,"Well Rosie
don't be scared
by the storm outside
We are safe and warm
we are home and dry
And though it rages on
there's no need to cry
Oh Rosie
don't you worry my dear
For there are many things
that I can not explain
Like the howling wind
like the pouring rain
Like the love for a child
like the pin prick of pain
Oh Rosie
don't you worry my dear
Well Rosie
don't you think about the things
that you can't change
For the world is cruel
and it's violent and strange
But there is beauty too
if you look the right way
Oh Rosie
don't you worry my dear
Oh oh oh Rosie

Chicken Fried,81,Zac Brown Band,"You know I like my chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes

There's no dollar sign
On a peace of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree
Have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get a little chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you
Merry Christmas darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always somethin' new
But every day is a holiday
When I'm near to you
The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish
on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish
on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you

Crush,57,faith zapata,"i'm okay on my own but i like being with you
see everything in pink when you shift into view
loved you through summer, winter, spring, and fall
known you two years but i want them all

i sit in my room, i write too many songs about you
i like how my name sounds next to yours
you're so far away, think about you everyday
i just wish you lived next door

do you think about me still
when you hear my name, do you get a thrill
i wanna know if you feel it too
still, i know that i'd never tell you how i feel
no, i'd never spill these crushy feelings all over you

cause i'm way too scared of that
i don't wanna be a bother
i'm way too shy for that
i don't wanna be another girl who gets her heart broken in two
over you
i prefer my fantasy of you

i'm okay on my own but i like being with you
see everything in pink when you shift into view
loved you through summer, winter, spring, and fall
known you two years but i want them all"

Little Ghost Town,98,Mykey,"Well I’m just sitting on a fire escape
Killing time and keeping out of the way
Above a diver and a laundromat
Call my name and I will come on back
Anytime I need a glass to spill. Another ear to fill
To listen to me talk and won’t send me a bill
You tell it like it is and don’t ever make a sound
Here’s to my little ghost town

Well I’m just sitting on a fire escape
Dropping pennies in the ally way
The storm drain behind the old motel
It’s like a personal wishing well
Pretty soon the sky went tangerine over black and green
Something real classic like a Hopper scene
I should go but I’m sure I’ll see you around
Here’s to my little ghost town
Here’s to my little ghost town"

Everything Falls for You,169,Seaforth,"The roses that I bought
you last week
Are just petals on the floor
by your feet
Nah they didn't stand a chance
And yeah girl I understand
You ain't got a damn clue I bet
But I see
broken hearts trace your steps
And any time I hear the rain
I know just who to play blame
Baby what's it like
to watch the sky
throw stars down
For you and nobody else
Baby it's dominoes
everywhere you go
And right now I guess
Your gravity got me too
Everything falls for you
Everything falls for you
yeah mmm
I swear you could make
my jaw drop
And plans change baby
any time you want
Just by walking through the door
Or letting that dress
hit the floor
I'm like the strap
off your shoulder
The lights getting lower
Kissing you slower and slower oh
Baby what's it like
to watch the sky
throw stars down
For you and nobody else
Baby it's dominoes
everywhere you go
And right now I guess
Your gravity got me too
Everything falls for you
Everything falls for you oh
Baby what's it like
to watch the sky
throw stars down
For you and nobody else
Baby it's dominoes
everywhere you go
And right now I guess
Your gravity got me too

These Days,88,Thelma Plum,"It's coming 'round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day

This life, well, it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control, well, it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

It's coming 'round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
It settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day
Soon enough it comes

Here it is again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Undignified and lame

This life, well, it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control, well, it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

Soon enough it comes

Undress me with your eyes
It ain't even June
But boy I know that
I want you heatin' up my summer
Keepin' me up all night

We sneak in we can

The blues walked in and met me
Oh yeah if he stays away
Old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Oh I can't go on, can't go on, can't go on

White Noise,44,Grace Pettis,"Ninety nine white sheep
safe in the herd
One black sheep lost
we don’t say a word
But God’s looking down
on His child on the pavement
Leave the ninety nine behind
for the one that needs saving
Can’t say that you love
your neighbor
Can’t say that you love me
Can’t say All lives matter
He can’t breathe
Say his name
If you use your voice
Don’t just add to the white noise
Shouts in the hallway
they break down the door
And Breonna Taylor
is dead on the floor
And she would’ve been a nurse
if she hadn’t been another one
With 8 shots fired
from an officer’s gun
Can’t say Law and order
Or the land of the free
Can’t say All lives matter
When she can’t breathe
Say her name
If you use your voice
Don’t just add to the white noise
What have you done
Where is your brother
Ahmaud and Eric
Trayvon and George
What have you done
Where is your brother
Not one more Not one more
Can’t say Law and order
Or the land of the free
Can’t say All lives matter
They can’t breathe
Say her name
If you use your voice
Don’t just add to the white noise
Don’t just add to the white noise"
Change Your Mind,331,Keith Urban,"I’m somewhere in Brooklyn
Think what could’ve been
What city you in
I don’t wanna call you
Then I wanna call you
I miss the old you
I think of a message to send
My phone is at seven percent
But when I go and try to reach you
I never can get through
I was the problem
Self-sabotaging
You had no option
You had to go when you had to go
And I couldn’t stop it
I was not willing to bend
You said it again and again
You need a heart
that better fits you
So you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow’s side
You changed your number
And got some friends
that I don’t recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too late to try
If I change
Would you change your mind
Emotionally stranded
Left you abandoned
Took you for granted
And I should’ve listened
Showed my commitment
When you said we’re drifting
If we could live in reverse
I’d go to the part where it hurt
I’d go and fix the little issues
Before they got too big
Is this all your way to try
to not remember me
A beautiful disguise
so you’re not who you were with me
But I think I know you so well
Enough that I think I could tell
Are you afraid to say you miss me
‘Cause you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow’s side
You changed your number
And got some friends
that I don’t recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too late to try
If I change
Would you change your mind
Oh Yeah
Oh
Change your mind
Ummm
Yeah you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow’s side
You changed your number
And got some friends
that I don’t recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too late to try
If I change
Would you change your mind
Oh
Um
would you change your mind
Only sometimes"
The Stranger (Reimagined),479,Ingrid Andress,"I can't remember the last time

Looked into each other's eyes
And made the choice to choose us
Let's trace the steps
of where we've been
To make it feel like home again
And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place
where this all got started
Sometimes I wish
I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over
And fall all over each other again
I know you remember that first night
I asked if you would wanna dance
You made me laugh in the neon light
With your two left feet
telling me you can't
Let's trace those steps 'til we can find
Where we got lost in love that time
And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place
where this all got started
Sometimes I wish
I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over

You should try to be black like me
My daddy worked day and night
For an old house and a used car
Just to live that good life mm

But she would probably disagree

Verse 2
I don't need anything except to know that I can text
3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon
And you'll reply and come to me soon

Verse 3
Comfort me
Baby tiger's scratching at the door
She's seen someone she hasn't seen before
I'm okay, baby tiger

Verse 4
Don't prescribe me medication
I think that my mind is fine
I'm fully aware, it's just the time
Baby tiger's scratching at the door
Baby tiger's scratching at the door

Verse 5
Waiting for this man to finish up
I'm okay, baby tiger
I'll come back to me soon
I'll come back to me soon
Baby tiger's scratching at the door"

Are You Serious,78,Andrew Bird,"Verse 1
Used to have just one foot out the door
Yeah, I always wanted more
I always was the one
You thought would never marry
Used to be so wilfully obtuse, or is the word abstruse
Semantics like a noose, get out your dictionaries

Pre-Chorus
I'm gonna cut to the quick
This is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These are my true convictions

Chorus
So tell me, are you serious
Are you serious
Cause every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it

Verse 2
I see that you're down there and I'm up here
Your boyfriend's gone to get a beer
Leaving us crystal clear lines of communications
Promise me you won't avert your eyes
I'll drop my third-person disguise
You know it's time to do or die
No useless explanations

Pre-Chorus
I'm gonna cut to the quick
This is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These are my true convictions

Chorus
Tell me, are you serious
Are you serious
Every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it

Chorus fades to end"

Stoned at the Nail Salon,173,Lorde,"Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

[Chorus]
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail salon again

[Verse 2]
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

[Chorus]
'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen you'll grow out of
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

[Bridge]
Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

[Chorus]
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again"
Breakups (Acoustic),147,Seaforth,"You're the only one in the world

You'll be the first thing
on my mind in the morning oh
Sober or drunk

I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all

I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
But right now
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine
and talk about the past
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
Bought a drink for a girl
and I got her numbеr
Even thought about
walkin' her out that door mmm
The only thing that camе close
to you is her perfume oh
Got me wonderin'
what we gave it all up for oh-oh
I said I wouldn't call

Someone Somewhere,45,Nelly,"Every now and then the world needs a feel good song
'Cause sometimes life'll make you take the wrong way home
'Cause there's a road you know you shouldn't go down
You don't even feel at home in your hometown
Eight billion people here and you still feel alone

[Pre-Chorus]
It could be me today
It could be you
But you know either way (Either way)
This is what we'll do

Pour a little out for someone somewhere
Try to find a little bit of light in the dark
In someone somewhere

Rush hour on a Friday
Seen a couple folks broke down on the highway
And they ain't even goin' my way

Murder And Crime,107,Sufjan Stevens,"Evidence known so long
Oh God, I'm lost in my wrongs
Everything froze like stone
Saw your heart couldn't take much more

[Chorus]
My boy, I don't know why this life
Is so cruel and unkind, but it weighs on my heart
All joys were taken from your eyes
As the law would abide in murder and crime
Hard lines as the fossil defines
It's own shadow in lime and reveals how it dies

[Verse 2]
If anything goes, then everything's flawed
Oh my love, what the violence has caused
Malevolencе flowed from beyond
And my heart cannot takе much more

Oh joy I'm afraid of the light
As the jewel of my mind begins to fall apart
Do not destroy what has taken its time
As the lord would abide in murder and crime

[Chorus]
Oh my love, I don't know why this life
Is so cruel and unkind but it weighs on my heart
Fading lines as the fossil denies
It's own shadow in the time to conceal how it died

[Outro]
Evidence known, march on
Oh God, I'm lost in the antiphon
Where does everything go when everything's gone?
For my heart cannot break much more"
This Time Tomorrow,20,Brandi Carlile,"When the fire inside
that burns so bright
Begins to grow faded
It can be hard to see the ground
on which you stand
Though you may not be afraid
of walkin' in the darkness
You will feel like a stranger in this land
You can try to carve a faith
out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry
out the bone
And the edges of the night may
cause you sorrow
You know I may not be around
this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
Yeah, I'll always be with you
When the hope that you hold tightly
to has all but vanished
And there are no words
of comfort to be found
You will know what it means
to be lost and without love
May you fight to kill
that deafening sound
But our holy dreams
of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us
like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breakin' of the day
might bring you sorrow
You know I may not be around
this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You can try to carve a faith
out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry
out the bone
And the edges of the night may
cause you sorrow
You know I may not be around
this time tomorrow
But our holy dreams
of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us
like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breakin' of the day
might bring you sorrow
You know I may not be around
this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I will always be with you
I will always be with you
I'll always be with you"
Love Like You Care,19,Perlo,"Looking outside lately
Like you've seen a ghost
Do you see right through me

See you wake up slowly
When the light's already low
And the door starts closing

Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone together
Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone so

Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you

When you see your memories
Are there versions of me there
Do they still mean something

Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone together
Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone so

Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you

All I have left and all that I know
What is it worth and where do I go with
All I have left and all that I know
What is worth to know you

All I have left and all that I know
What is it worth and where do I go with
All I have left and all that I know
What is worth to know you

Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you

Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you"
Mountains O'Mourne,7,Don McLean,"Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
With people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes nor barley nor wheat
But there's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street
At least when I asked them, that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I've found there, I might as well be
In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea

I believe that when writin' a wish you expressed
As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed
Well if you'll believe me, when asked to a ball
They don't wear no tops to their dresses at all
Oh, I've seen them myself and you could not in truth
Tell it if they were bound for a ball or a bath
Don't be startin' them fashions now, Mary McRee
In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea

There's beautiful girls here, oh, never you mind
Beautiful shapes Nature never designed
Lovely complexions of roses and cream
But let me remark with regard to the same
That if at those roses you venture to sip
The colors might all come away on your lip
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waitin' for me
In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea

You remember young Diddy McClaren, of course
Well he's over here with the rest of the force
I saw him one day as he stood on the Strand
Stopped all the traffic with a wave of his hand
And as we were talking of days that are gone
The whole town of London stood there to look on
But for all his great powers, he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea"

My Ego Dies At The End,7,Jensen McRae,"I think I lost something in the water
I tried to swim to it
I could not swim to it
Drowned in a dream that should've make me stronger
I tried to swim through it
I could not swim through it

Leave my body and the party early
Cry on the train, playin' Justin Vernon
Such a long walk back to 30th

I have the dream again, I have the dream again
My ego dies at the end, it's ego death
I live the dream like I still don't know what it meant
Who am I? I've lost the thread
My ego dies at the end
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, ah, ah, ah

I lost the girl I was over a winter
I tried to cry for it
I could not cry for it
Sank down to search the bottom of the river
I tried to dive for it
I could not dive for it

Leave my body in the water early
Tried baptism but it felt like burning
If I don't write about it, was it really worth it?

I have the dream again, I have the dream again
My ego dies at the end, it's ego death
I live the dream like I still don't know what it meant
Who am I? I've lost the thread
My ego dies at the end

Leave my body and my ego early
Kill it kind with a surgeon's mercy
Claim I put it out of its misery

I have the dream again, I have the dream again
My ego dies at the end, it's ego death
I live the dream like I still don't know what it meant
Who am I? I've lost the thread
My ego dies at the end
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, ah, ah, ah"

Skin Crawl,44,Alice Phoebe Lou,"You're making my skin wanna crawl into all of these cracks and these crevices
Don't worry I know how to have a good time
Just don't need to smile to be enjoying myself
Don't put me on a shelf
I'm not here for your enjoyment, your amusement
I don't need to have a reason, no
Don't need to have a reason at all
Don't need to have a prince at my ball
How about right now I'm my own prince
Maybe I wouldn't cease to exist
Without a man to do the hard things
Maybe you picked the wrong girl
But there's not one girl
Who deserves your aggression
I'll give you a confession
I used to fall for this bullshit
But let's stop regressing
How about I take your patriarchy, your misogyny
And I put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit

[Refrain]
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit

I'm gonna put it in the backyard
And set fire to it

Circles Around This Town,202,Maren Morris,"I swear I don't know how I trusted

of a door slam yet
Thank god I was an optimist

Just Like That,79,Bonnie Raitt,"I watched him circle 'round the block, finally stopped at mine
Took a while before he knocked like all he had was time
""Excuse me, ma’am, maybe you can help, the directions weren't so clear
I'm looking for Olivia Zand, they said I might find her here""
Well, I looked real hard and asked him, ""What she’s got he's looking for?""
Said, ""There's somethin' I think she'd wanna know"" and I let him in the door
It's not like me to trust so quick, caught me by surprise
But somеthin' about him gave me easе, right there in his eyes

[Chorus]
And just like that, your life can change if I hadn't looked away
My boy might still be with me now, he’d be twenty-five today
No knife can carve away the stain, no drink can drown regret
They say Jesus brings you peace and grace, well, He ain’t found me yet

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
He sat down and took a deeper breath, then looked right in my face
I heard about the son you lost, how you left without a trace
I've spent years just tryna find you so I could finally let you know
It was your son’s heart that saved me, and a life you gave us both

[Chorus]
And just like that, your life can change, look what the angels send
I lay my head upon his chest and I was with my boy again
Well, I've spent so long in darkness, I never thought the night would end
But somehow, grace has found me, and I had to let Him in

Sheepskin Lady,8,Ari Lindo,"Sheepskin Lady
How you made me
Dance and frolic like an alcoholic

A glass eyed fool
Jumping in the deep end of a pool

Treading slowly
Barely floating
Reach your hand out but i fall flat

Right on my face
Sippin on a cigarette you smile

We're quick to fall
Back in my dear

Young and foolish
Blindly follow
Hidden footsteps with our eyes closed

Without regret
Come on babe lets take another

Without regret
Come on babe lets take another step

Take another step
Take another step
Take another"

You're gon' be thanking your lucky stars
For all this pain
Pain

For all this pain, oh pain

The sky isn't falling, no no no, that's just the rain
It's safe to just call this

Pain
Girl, I've been there, yeah life, it ain't fair
It's okay to not be all right, just go 'head and cry
It might sound insane but I promise one day
You're gon' be thanking your lucky stars
For all this pain
For all this pain
Pain

For all this pain"
Oklahoma Smokeshow,7,Zach Bryan,"Verse 1
Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears

Verse 2
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue old pickup truck
You've got nowhere to go although you're all gussied up

Verse 3
There's so much whiskey in his coke it'll make her nose bend
But she swears that his love is a damn God sent
She's known God since she was a child

Verse 4
She used to play in the yard and she would drеam of one day
Til the world came around and took hеr dreamin' away
Told her how to dress and act and smile

Bridge
She's an Oklahoma smokeshow
He's an asshole from back home
She won't ever make it out alive

Bridge
That small town bar scene
Where small vices kill your big dreams
He'd take you home but he's too drunk to drive

Chorus
I'll be here, I've been up all night
Thinkin' about a life with you and I
One you'll never know
'Cause you're a small town smokeshow

Chorus
Well I'll be here, I've been up all night
Thinkin' about a life with you and I
One you'll never know
'Cause you're a small town smokeshow

Verse 5
Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears

Verse 6
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue old pickup truck
You've got nowhere to go although you're all gussied up"
Handle On You,12,Parker McCollum,"I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Drop a needle on a vinyl and cry to old an Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby breakin' the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake up everyday black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you

[Verse 2]
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til ""I miss you"" don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks

[Chorus]
Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose

Well, I finally got a handle on you

Wanna Be with You,13,Lawson Hull,"Oh, what a scene
You were there dancing all free
The house band playing their closing theme
How I dared to dream
And for once it paid off

We’re on the run
Heart’s beating like a drum
The fever broken in the dark of the night
Your hand in mine
Waiting for the sun

And I wanna be the man for a girl like you
The man I wanna be, I wanna be with you

Into the cold
Was it the liquor or love making us bold
You wrapped in a towel, holding me close
Those shivering bones
Just tell me when the feelings grow

And I wanna be the man for a girl like you
The man I wanna be, I wanna be with you

I could stay here forever
Tell you all my fears
Hold you til my arms collapse

See your eyes in the ocean
All spinning in blue
Shining out through the black

Walking back to your place
Dancing around the conversation
The streetlight on your face
Such a heavenly sight
And I wanna be the man for a girl like you
The man I wanna be, I wanna be with you"

Same Boat,2,Zac Brown Band,"Intro
We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes
We're all in the same boat

Verse 1
We could all believe what we believe
Peacefully agree to disagree
But you can't judge a man
Until you walk a country mile in his shoes
Dood'n-doo-doo-doo

Chorus
We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat

Verse 2
We all been kicked and knocked around
But you ain't gonna keep a good man down
You can run like hell from your mistakes
But you can't hide from your truth
Rood'n-doo-doo-doo

Chorus
We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat

Bridge
Share them peaches if you're holdin'
Take those shots and keep reloadin'
If you can't be nice, don't say nothin' at all
So help somebody who might be strugglin'
Spread a little love, gotta give back somethin'
If this ship keeps rockin', we'll all go overboard

Chorus
We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat
Yeah, we're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat"
Photograph,16,Alex Siegel,"Thought we'd have a little more time
Before tomorrow's sun would rise
And wash out the stars from your eyes
You will go back to your life
And I'll have to go back to mine
Knowing the pain of life's design
To never be by your side
My photograph overexposed

Show me a part of your world
It's just the same as mine
A familiar face in the clouds
Different maps and street signs
Though I can't be part of your world
We can pretend just for a while
There's some other place I belong
And you will be safe in another's arms"
Better Strangers,1,Karley Scott Collins,"Verse 1
We could walk down the street and
Our eyes wouldn't meet and
I could go to all the places we used to go to
My heart would still beat, but
Wouldn't feel so incomplete and
I could meet the girl I'd be if I didn't know you
But, boy, I know you

Chorus
I wish we were better strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed in fairy tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your face
If you had never said my name
Love was morе than just a losin' game
I wish we werе better strangers

Verse 2
Couldn't tell you how it feels
I got a pain that never heals
The kind that brings you to your knees
Hits you so hard that you can't breathe
Like you did to me

Chorus
I wish we were better strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed in fairy tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your face
If you had never said my name
Love was more than just a losin' game
I wish we were better strangers
Better strangers

Bridge
Wish I could take back all my secrets
Take back all my tears
Wish you were somethin' I didn't believe in
Like you were never here
I wish we were better strangers
Better strangers

Chorus
I wish we were better strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed in fairy tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your face
If you had never said my name
Love was more than just a losin' game
I wish we were better strangers"
"Mama, Dolly, Jesus",16,Madeline Edwards,"(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Tell me, did you walk on water?
Do you know a woman named Jolene?
Can you claim me as your daughter?
Did you rock me to sleep? Pray for my soul to keep?
No, no, no, I don't think so, so, so

[Chorus]
You ain't Mama, Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voices in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stones, I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama, Dolly, or Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Those three got a lot in common
The kinds you wanna have a drink with
'Cause they love people at rock bottom
And they ain't gonna sit when there's a table to flip
So get off my back if you can't say that, that, that

[Chorus]
You ain't Mama, Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voicеs in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stonеs, I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama, Dolly, or Jesus

[Bridge]
I can't pay my rent with your two cents
So keep it to yourself
And when I get lost, can't bear the cross
I know who can help (I know who can help)

[Chorus]

They're the only voices in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stones, I ain't inclined to please you

There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some shit

[Verse 1]
That you'd hate to grow up and miss
Hate to think of what if
I didn't even know what a honey hole with a Zebco
And my jeans rolled and a pinch of Skoal in my lip even is
They say we ain't got a pot to piss but I thank God for this

Love You Anyway,7,Luke Combs,"If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome

I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

[Pre-Chorus]
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

[Chorus]
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

There's just some things that leave a man no choice

Another Universe,14,Angelo De Augustine,"What would it take to break the curse?
I found another universe
One who would have me
One I would belong
I'm growing tired of the offense
Fateful design, omnipotence
Whether to use both my hands for love
For love
For love

All I've wanted, I
Am transported to another plane
When I close my eyes and lay me down
Oh, when I close my eyes and lay me down

If I created my own world
Minds would be open and unfurled
I'd navigate a way out of the storm
There would be no more hurt or pain
Deliverance would end its wage
The galaxy would be a guide for love
For love
For love

All I've wanted, I
Am transported to another plane
When I close my eyes and lay me down
Oh, when I close my eyes and lay me down"

Legal In England,20,Lila Dupont,"Call me by your name again
So I remember how to love
I’ll make fun of you
to your parents again
You make magic with your touch
When you’re in it
you think that it’s different
From anything you’ve had before
But when you’re drinking,
not thinking and really never
listening
It’s not weird
that things got worse
So wake me up when it’s over
I know you’re not sober anymore
Eighteen in your kitchen
you’re legal in England
but I’m not
You’d play strings and I would
dance around with nothing
but my makeup on
I make it sound so poetic
but that really never happened
It’s just something I dreamt up
So wake me up when it’s over
we’re both not sober anymore
Nineteen we’re not talking
I’m finally in Scotland
and you’re not
Feeling like a piece of space
trying so hard not to fade away
Weightlessness is never around
cause you’re just a force
holding me down
Holding me
Holding me
Holding me down
Holding me down
Holding me down
So wake me up when it’s over
we’re both not sober anymore
Eighteen in your kitchen
you’re legal in England

as this ship sinks way out of sight

I want to lay down my world at your door
you say you’ll miss me I’ll miss you more

I keep holding on to your love
Even when you have given up
I want to hold you again like before
I want to lay down my world at your door
you say you’ll miss me I’ll miss you more
time won’t heal this heart
Truth stands in place
While silent storms roar
When love shows her face
The wind whispers cures
And I will always be yours
I want to hold you again like before
Still want to lay down my world at your door
You say you’ll miss me I’ll miss you more
Time won’t heal this heart

Heartbreak On The Map,28,Dan + Shay,"This barstool knows my name by now
Midnight longneck lost and found
Asking everyone in town
If they've seen that girl
That girl that went and done me wrong
Turned me to a country song
Kind that bars play all night long
Jukebox full of Merle

Ooh, took a page out the get gone book
Ooh, and I don't where to look

She might be west of Texas, east of Tennessee
Could be Colorado, oh,
all I know is that she ain't here with me
Since it went south, taillights in a dust cloud
Left me, and she left me wonderin'
where the hell she's at
That girl put heartbreak on the map

She got me runnin' around
She got me spinnin' in circles
She ain't comin' back
That girl put heartbreak on the map

Didn't leave me with a goodbye kiss
Just a little whiskey on my lips
And this lonesome state I'm in
Ain't getting no better

Ooh
Got a 30A bumper sticker
Ooh, if you see her let her know I miss her

She might be west of Texas, east of Tennessee
Could be Colorado, oh,
all I know is that she ain't here with me
Since it went south, taillights in a dust cloud
Left me, and she left me wonderin'
where the hell she's at

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Heaven + Back,26,Dan + Shay,"It wasn't even half as far as I thought it'd be
It was barely out of town
Somewhere in between a creek
and some evergreens
She was showing me around

I swore I saw a halo
Hanging over her head
I didn't know I needed saving
But that's just what she did

Last night, I went to heaven and back,
and I stayed there for a while
I danced with an angel till the stars went black,
last night, I went to heaven and back
She took my hand, and I saw the light,
and I hope I'm going back tonight
Hey!

There was something 'bout the way
that she held me close
There was magic in her eyes
Watched her put a little gold on a gravel road
Turned the water into wine

Sunday morning's got nothing on her
You might not believe it, but I'm pretty sure

Last night, I went to heaven and back,
and I stayed there for a while
I danced with an angel till the stars went black,
last night, I went to heaven and back
She took my hand, and I saw the light,
and I hope I'm going back tonight
Hey!

I swore I saw a halo
Hanging over her head

The Ballad of Lucy Gray Baird (from The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes),30,Rachel Zegler,"When I was a babe I feel down in the holler
When I was a girl I fell into your arms
We fell on hard times and we lost our bright color
You went to the dogs and I lived by my charms

I danced for my dinner, spread kisses like honey
You stole and you gambled and I said you should
We sang for our suppers, we drank up our money
Then one day you left saying I was no good

Well, all right, I’m bad, but then you’re no prize either
All right, I’m bad, but then that’s nothing new
You say you won’t love me, I won’t love you neither
Just let me remind you who I am to you

‘Cause I am the one who looks out when you’re leaping
I am the one who knows how you were brave
And I am the one who heard what you said sleeping
I’ll take that and more when I go to my grave

It’s sooner than later that I’m six feet under
It’s sooner than later that you’ll be alone
So who will you turn to tomorrow, I wonder?
For when the bell rings, lover, you’re on your own

I am the one who you let see you weeping
I know the soul that you struggle to save
Too bad I’m the bet that you lost in the reaping
Now what will you do when I go to my grave"

On The Way,4,Hollow Coves,"I will tread down a lonesome track
Set my eyes on the wild and won't look back
I will follow where my heart reacts

Venture out to the great unknown
Find a place where I can feel alive again
Throw caution to the wind

I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way

Climbing up from the valley below
Seeing places and faces I've never known
I will follow to the open road

Through the trees 'til I see the sun
Now I know that I can feel alive again
Throw caution to the wind

I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way

Step by step I come alive
Lift my head up to the skies
Won't look back I'll chase the sun
Live the life I'm dreaming of

I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way

You've Got A Friend,829,Carole King,"When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing nothing is going right

Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even
your darkness night
You just call out my name
And you know whenever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north
winds begin to blew

Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me
knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know whenever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
yes i will you do
now Ain't it good to know that
you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh but don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know whenever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
yes i will
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend"
The Sound Of Silence,221,Simon & Garfunkel,"Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while
I was sleeping
And the vision
that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar
to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs
that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
'Fools' said I
'You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that
I might teach you
Take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words like
silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed
out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said
'The words of
the prophets are written
on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd
in the sounds of silence"
Shooting Star,18,Bob Dylan,"Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you.
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew.
I always kind of wondered
If you ever made it through.
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you.

Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me.
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or
Over-step the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me.

Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying,
It's the last temptation
The last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
The last radio is playing.

Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip Away.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say.
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away."
Scuttle Buttin',253,Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble,"Clearly we won't know unless we try
The possibilities are open
To create a new situation
Surely we won't know unless we try
I am far too young to die
Tell me about the general people
My belly's bursting without a
And who are the general people?
Just a grain of sense that you confess
I have regrets if I die
Refuge in superstitions and dreams
Toying with the imaginary
Memory becomes a luxury
Refuge in superstitions and dreams
It's no way to make history
No we won't know, we won't know
We won't know unless we try"
Hey Hey,82,Eric Clapton,"Hey hey Hey hey baby hey

You had me fooled
I found it out somehow"
Baby Can I Hold You,189,Tracy Chapman,"Sorry
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry like sorry
Forgive me
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me forgive me
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time you'd be mine

I love you
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you I love you
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time you'd be mine
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time you'd be mine"
"Blowin' in the Wind (Live at Boston Music Hall, Boston, MA - November 21, 1975 - Evening)",419,Bob Dylan,"How many roads must
a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must
a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must
the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The Answer my friend
is blowing in the wind

How many times must
a man look up
before he can see the sky
How many ears must
one man have
before he can peaple cry


바람이 불러주는 노래

얼마나 더 먼
길을 가야만
사람들은 사람다워질까?
얼마나 더 멀리
바다를 날아가야만
비둘기는 쉴 수 있을까?
얼마나 더
많은 포탄이 터져야만
피비린내 나는 싸움이 끝날까?
친구여, 묻지 말아요
오직 바람만이 알고 있는데.


얼마나 더
우러러 보아야
푸른 하늘이 보일까?
얼마나 더
많이 귀기울여야
울음소리가 들릴까?"

Wide Open Spaces,99,The Chicks,"Who Doesn't Know What I'm Talking About
Who's Never Left Home, Who's Never Struck Out
To Find A Dream And A Life Of Their Own
A Place In The Clouds, A Foundation Of Stone
Many Precede And Many Will Follow
A Young Girl's Dream No Longer Hollow
It Takes The Shape Of A Place Out West
But What It Holds For Her, She Hasn't Yet Guessed
She Needs Wide Open Spaces
Room To Make Her Big Mistakes
She Needs New Faces
She Knows The Highest Stakes
She Travelled This Road As A Child
Wide Eyed And Grinning, She Never Tired
But Now She Won't Be Coming Back With The Rest
If These Are Life's Lessons, She'll Take This Test
Repeat Chorus
She Knows The Highest Stakes

As Her Folks Drive Away,
Her Dad Yells, Check The Oil!
Mom Stares Out The Window And Says,
I'm Leaving My Girl
She Says, It Didn't Seem Like That Long Ago
When She Stood There And Let Her Own Folks Know
She Needed Wide Open Spaces
Room To Make Her Big Mistakes
She Needs New Faces
She Knows The Highest Stakes

Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,19,Bob Dylan,"Well, they'll stone ya when you're trying to be so good,
They'll stone ya just a-like they said they would.
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to go home.
Then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
Well, they'll stone ya when you're walkin' 'long the street.
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to keep your seat.
They'll stone ya when you're walkin' on the floor.
They'll stone ya when you're walkin' to the door.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
They'll stone ya when you're at the breakfast table.
They'll stone ya when you are young and able.
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to make a buck.
They'll stone ya and then they'll say, good luck.
Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned alright

Well, they'll stone you when you walk all alone.
They'll stone you when you are walking home.
They'll stone you and then say you are brave.
They'll stone you when you are set down in your grave.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned."
Subterranean Homesick Blues,51,Bob Dylan,"Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D. A.
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try ""No Doz""
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows

Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But users, cheaters
Six-time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters

Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles"

Half The Way,27,Crystal Gayle,"Half of your love is just
not what I'm after
Part of your world is just
not what I need
Some of your time is like
one glass of water
Just leaves me
thirsty for wine
So fill me up to the top
Wo don't you stop
till I'm over flowing
Love is the seed
and babe I need you
To keep it growing
Stronger every day
Oh no
Don't take me half the way
Don't take me half the way

Never before have I
settled for second
All of my life I have
hungered for more
Now I can see where your
sweet love can lead me
This is what I've waited for
So fill me up to the top
Wo don't you stop
till I'm over flowing
Love is the seed

To keep it growing
Stronger every day
Oh no
Don't take me half the way
Don't take me half the way

Half of your love is just

Baby Driver,54,Simon & Garfunkel,"My daddy was the family bassman
My mamma was an engineer
And I was born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears
In my ears
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Shine a light
My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mamma's in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve
I did not serve
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba mmm ba ba ba ba
My daddy got a big promotion
My mamma got a raise in pay
There's no one home
we're all alone
Oh come into my room and play
Yes we can play
I'm not talking
about your pigtails
But I'm talking
'bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel"
River Man,157,Nick Drake,"Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves
Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes
Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time
If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime
Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure
For when she thought
of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more
Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free
If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me
Oh how they come and go
Oh how they come and go"
' Cello Song,62,Nick Drake,"Strange face with your eyes
So pale and sincere
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came
to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung
You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight
But while the earth
sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave
So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song
And if one day you should
see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud"
Still Rainin',85,Jonny Lang,"Clouds, one by one, fill the sky
Just like these tears that fill my eyes
I know by now she ain't comin' back
I watch my world slowly fade into black

Look out my window it's still rainin'
Look out my window it's still rainin'

They say that time heals everything
I've felt the pain that love can bring
It don't get no better with each passing day
Any hope I had is slowly slipping away

Look out my window, it's still rainin'
Look out my window, it's still rainin'

I thought the morning would rescue me
But the rain keeps falling endlessly, endlessly
Sometimes I wonder what'll become of me
There ain't much left of what I used to be
Her love shone on me like the morning light
Now here I am alone again tonight

Look out my window, it's still rainin'
Look out my window, it's still rainin'"
Wink,4,Neal McCoy,"I woke up this morning my head felt dense
I splashed it with water trying to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen she was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Well it's her way of saying she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin' and I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

In this complicated world it may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cures
Pushed to the limit or standing at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink"

I Shot The Sheriff,67,Eric Clapton,"I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy

All around in my home town
They're trying to
track me down
They say they want to bring me
in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

I shot the sheriff
but I swear it was in
self defense
I shot the sheriff
and they say it is a
capital offense
Sheriff John Brown
always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said
Kill it before it grows
He said
Kill it before it grows
I say

I shot the sheriff
but I swear it was in
self defense
I shot the sheriff
but I swear it was in
self defense
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden
I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot I shot him down
I say

I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket
goes to the well
But one day the bottom
will drop out
Yesone day the bottom
will drop out
But I say
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
oh no
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
oh no"
Let It Grow,53,Eric Clapton,"Standing at the crossroads
trying to read the signs
To tell me which way
I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and
let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
Looking for a reason
to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend
that I can count on
But there's nothing left to show
Plant your love and
let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
let it grow
let it grow
Time is getting shorter
and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get
what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and
let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow"
The Boxer,60,Simon & Garfunkel,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story is seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles,
Such are promises,all lies, and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest Mm mm....


When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers,
In the quiet of a railway station
Running scared, laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Lie-la-lie


Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a ""come on"" from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there Ooo-la-la


Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains"
Years,72,Barbara Mandrell,"faded photographs

the feelings all come back

even now sometimes

you feel so near

and I still see your face

like it was yeasterday

it's strange how the days turned into years



years of hanging on

to dreams are already gone

years of wishing you were here

after all this time you'd think I wouldnt cry

it's just that I still love you after all these years



nighttime gently falls

another day is gone

I turn around to find you're still not here

I leave the hall light on

in case you come back home

but I've been saying that for years



years of hanging on

to dreams are already gone

it's of wishing you were here

after all this time you'd think I wouldnt cry

it's just that I still love you after all these years



after all these years"

I'm Tore Down,34,Freddie King,"Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

Well, I went to the river
To jump in
My baby showed up and said
'I will tell you when'

Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

I love you baby

With all my heart an' soul
A love like mine will never grow old
I love you in the mornin'
And in the evenin', too
But ev'rytime you leave me
I get mad with you

Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

I love you, baby with all my might
A love like mine is out of sight
I'll lie for you if you want me to
I really don't believe your love is true

Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

A-well I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found."
Rhinestone Cowboy,50,Glen Campbell,"Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy





I've been walking these streets so long

Singing the same old song

I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway

Where hustle is the name of the game

And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain

There's been a load of compromising

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me



후렴 : Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy

Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers coming over the phone



Well I really don't mind the rain

And a smile can hide all the pain

But you're down when you're riding a train

That's taking the long way

And I dream of the thing I'll do

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There's been a load of compromising

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me"
Stand by Your Man,96,Tammy Wynette,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman

Giving all your love to just one man

You'll have bad times and he'll have good times

Doing things that you don't understand

But if you love him please forgive him

Even though he's hard to understand

And if you love him, whoa be proud of him

'Cause after all he's just man

Stand by your man

Give him to arms to cling to

And something warm to come to

When the nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man

And show the world you love him

Keep giving all the love you can

Stand by your man

And if you love him, whoa be proud of him

'Cause after all he's just a man

Stand by your man

Give him to arms to cling to

And something warm to come to

When the nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man

And show the world you love him

Keep giving all the love you can

Stand by your man"
Put A Little Love In Your Heart,11,Dolly Parton,"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see

Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart"
Leaves That Are Green,57,Simon & Garfunkel,"I was twenty one years
when I wrote this song
twenty two now
but I won't be for long
Time hurries on
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown
And they wither in the wind
And they crumble in your hand
Once my heart was filled
with the love of a girl
I held her close
but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown
And they wither in the wind
And they crumble in your hand
I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripple run away
And they never made a sound
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown
And they wither in the wind
And they crumble in your hand
Hello hello hello hello
Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye
That's all there is
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown"
Kathy's Song,28,Simon & Garfunkel,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
like a memory it falls
soft and warm continuing
tapping on my roof and walls
And from the shelter of my mind
through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain
drenched streets
to England where my heart lies

My minds distracted and diffused
my thoughts are many miles away
they lie with you and you're asleep
kiss you when you start your day
and the song
I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
writing songs I can't believe
with words that tear and
strain to rhyme

and so you see I have come to doubt
all that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
the only truth I know is you
and as I watch the drops of rain
weave thier weary paths and I
I know that I am like the rain
there but for the grace of you go I"
The Three Bells (Les Trois Cloches) (Feat. Jim Ed Brown),27,The Browns,"There is a village
hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a Sunday morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born
All the chapel bells were ringing
in the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
was for baby Jimmy Brown
Then the little congregation
prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love
There is a village
hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years there after
Jimmy was to meet his love
All the chapel bells were ringing
was a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing
was for Jimmy and his wife
Then the little congregation
prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
bless, oh Lord this celebration
May their lives be filled with love
From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Little Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just a lonely bell was ringing
in the little valley town
Was farewell that it was singing
to our little Jimmy Brown
And the little congregation
prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
may his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love"
"Behind the Clouds (From ""Cars""/Soundtrack Version)",96,Brad Paisley,"When you`re feeling lonely, lost and let down
Seems like those dark skies are following you around
And life`s just one big shade of gray
You wonder if you`ll see the light of day

[chorus]
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can`t quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there`s a big blue sky waiting just behind the clouds

I`ve heard it said that this too shall pass
Good times or bad times, neither one lasts
But thinking that your luck won`t ever change
Is like thinking it won`t ever stop once it starts to rain

[chorus]
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can`t quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there`s a big blue sky waiting just behind the clouds
Yeah, there`s a big blue sky waiting just behind the clouds"
God Bless The U.S.A.,85,Lee Greenwood,"If tomorrow all the things were gone,
I？d worked for all my life.
And I had to start again,
with just my children and my wife.

I？d thank my lucky stars,
to be living here today.
？Cause the flag still stands for freedom,
and they can？t take that away.

And I？m proud to be an American,
where at least I know I？m free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
who gave that right to me.

And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
？Cause there ain？t no doubt I love this land,
God bless the USA.

From the lakes of Minnesota,
to the hills of Tennessee.
Across the plains of Texas,
From sea to shining sea.

From Detroit down to Houston,
and New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart,
and it's time we stand and say.

That I？m proud to be an American,
where at least I know I？m free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
who gave that right to me.

And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
？Cause there ain？t no doubt I love this land,
God bless the USA.

And I？m proud to be and American,
where at least I know I？m free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
who gave that right to me.

And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
？Cause there ain？t no doubt I love this land,
God bless the USA"

Homeward Bound,95,Simon & Garfunkel,"I’m sittin’ in the railway station
Got a ticket for my destination
On a tour of one night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one man band

Homeward bound I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought’s escaping
Home, where my music’s playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Everyday’s an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger’s face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

Homeward bound I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought’s escaping
Home, where my music’s playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Tonight I’ll sing my songs again
I’ll play the game and pretend
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptyness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me

Homeward bound I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought’s escaping
Home, where my music’s playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Silently for me
Silently for me -"
Morning Has Broken,38,Cat Stevens,"Morning has broken
like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken
like the first bird
Praise for the singing
praise for the morning
Praise for the springing
fresh from the world

Sweet the rain's new fall
sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall
on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness
of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
where his feet pass

Mine is the sunlight
mine is the morning
Born of the one light
eden saw play
Praise with elation
praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day

Morning has broken
ike the first morning
Backbird has spoken
like the first bird
Praise for the singing
praise for the morning
Praise for the springing
fresh from the world"
Pancho & Lefty,14,Emmylou Harris,"Livin' on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams

Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Well, Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dyin' words
Ah but that's the way it goes

All the Federales say
Could of had him any day
Only let him any day
Hang around
Out of kindness I suppose

Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to gop
There ain't nobody knows

Well, the poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The dessert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
So the story end's, we're told
Pancho needs your prayer's it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He just did what he had to do
And now he's growin' old
A few gray Federales say
Could have had him any day
Only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose"
Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,120,Crystal Gayle,"I don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
Tell me no secrets tell me some lies
Give me no reasons give me alibis
Tell me you love me
and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue"
Bird Stealing Bread,51,iron & wine,"Tell me baby tell me
Are you still on the stoop
Watching the windows close
I've not seen seen you lately
On the street, by the beach
Or places we used to go

I've a picture of you
On our favorite day by the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought out from under my nose

Tell me baby tell me
Does his company make
Light of a rainy day
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak
And all that we wouldn't say

Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing you believe in
Or a bit like a bird stealing bread
Out from under your nose

Tell me baby tell me
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change
I've been thinking lately
of a night on the stoop
and all that we wouldn't say

If I see you again
On the street, by the beach
In the evening
Will you fly like a bird stealing bread
Out from under my nose"

White Horse,940,Taylor Swift,"Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need
it to As I paced back
and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on The days drag on
Stupid girl I should have known
I should have known
I'm not a princess
this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep
off her feet Lead her up
the stairwell This ain't Hollywood
this is a small town
I was a dreamer before
you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse
to come around Baby I was naive
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't wanna be in
love You had to fight to have
the upper hand I had so many
dreams About you and me
Happy endings Now I know
I'm not a princess
this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep
off her feet Lead her up
the stairwell This ain't Hollywood
this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you
went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse
to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness
begging for me Just like I always
wanted but I'm so sorry
Cause I'm not your princess
this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
This is a big world
that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror
disappearing now And its too late
for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you
and your white horse
to catch me now

Try and catch me now
Oh it's too late To catch me now"
Change,667,Taylor Swift,"And it's a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets
What you wanted again
You know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history
And you're getting sick of it
But i believe in whatever you do
And i'll do anything
to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up
To hold us back
Will fall down
It's a revolution
The time will come
for us to finally win
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah oh

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight
When the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
From things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared
You can walk away
Say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up
To hold us back
Will fall down
It's a revolution
The time will come
for us to finally win
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah oh

Tonight we'll stand and get
off our knees
Fight for what
we've worked for All these years
The battle was long
It was the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up
champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
The walls that they put up
To hold us back
Fell down It's a revolution
Throw your hands up
cause we never gave in
We'll sing hallelujah
We sang hallelujah
Hallelujah"

You'll see.
Oh baby, one look just might save me.
I need you to slow by the corner.
Stop right in front of me.

Till then I'll see you hopefully through.
I do wish that you'd ask me to ride along.
It wouldn't be wrong to tell me more than I know about you.

Diesel, Mercedes, green, two-door.
I barely know who you are.

I'd sure like to ask you to stay.

Baby, I need you to save me.
The one thing that my heart requires is that you admire me.

Till then I'll see you hopefully through.
I do wish that you'd ask me to ride along.
It wouldn't be wrong to tell me more than I know about you.

How do I know why the sight of you makes me weak?
Each time I see you turn onto my street
Your hair is always up in a bun.
This girl is the one.

You Got Growin Up To Do (Feat. Patty Griffin),19,Joshua Radin,"I've been down this road before
I walk out the door
Leave you on the floor

Sometimes you run and hide
Your foolish pride's
What keeps me from
Giving you more

So the best thing I can give to you
Is for me to go
Leave you alone
Cause you got growin' up to do

Someday I'll return when its time
For payment in kind
The church bells will chime

You'll stand before me surrounded by lights
Dressed in white
You throw flowers in the air this night

But the best thing I can give to you
Is for me to go
Leave you alone
You got growin' up to do

Looks like the rain's pouring down on me
It's drowning me now
And all I want is to come back home
And this old corduroy coat is not keeping me dry
But I can't think of what else to try

That's why the best thing I can give to you
Is for me to go
Leave you alone
You got growin' up to do

Yeah, the best thing I can give to you is for me to go
Leave you alone
You got growin' up to do"

Skyrocket,277,Suehee,"If we could sky rocket away

Up-up and away into the velvet skies

We'd leave all our troubles behind

Make faces at birds that pass by



It would be just you and I

And nobody else to complicate this love

We'll wave at the world down below

And play tunes on our radio



And if on the way we get tired

We'll doze off amongst the clouds

And I'll catch you if you roll off

And hold you so you never fall



And if you allow me well make love amongst the stars

See the world from high up above

Oceans will look like ponds, people will look like crumbs

Fears will be miles apart~



If we could sky rocket away

Up-up and away into the clear blue skies

We'll ride to the heavens above

And stop to give hugs to lost loves



And I'll be here for you indeed

As long as you stay here with me

I'll listen to your every thought

And hang onto your every word



And if you allow me I'll pick out the brightest star

Place it on your wedding ring

And I pledge to keep you safe, shelter you from the rains

Guard you from monsters about"
Long Line Of Pain,14,Amos Lee,"I come from a long line of pain
My family suffered greatly for my gain
And I think a lot about
How my daddy died
So I would not live without

And his heart lives in my song
Where the melody comes
And just as quickly the melody is gone
I'm back alone, far from home

Now my mamma's on her own
I try to call her and see her when I'm home
And after all that she's been through
All the doctors say: ""There ain't nothing we can do""

And her heart lives in my song
Where the melody comes
And just as quickly the melody is gone
I'm back alone, far from home

There's a bird outside my window
Takes the song where he goes
And he leaves it there
Like a dead man's rocking chair

And tonight I'm feeling lost and
Headin' down the highway out to Boston
I get the sense I might lose it
I thank God tonight for the light I got in music

'Cause my heart lives in this song
Where the melody comes
And just as quickly, the melody is gone
I'm back alone, far from home"
Cruel Sister,24,Pentangle,"""There lived a lady by the North Sea shore (Lay the bent to the bonnie broom) Two daughters were the babes she bore (Fa la la la la la la la la la) alternating with each of the lines below> As one grew bright as is the sun, So coal black grew the elder one. A knight came riding to the lady's door, He'd travelled far to be their wooer. He courted one with gloves and rings, But he loved the other above all things. Oh sister will you go with me To watch the ships sail on the sea? She took her sister by the hand And led her down to the North Sea strand. And as they stood on the windy shore The dark girl threw her sister o'er. Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam, Crying, """"Sister, reach to me your hand! """"Oh Sister, Sister, let me live, And all that's mine I'll surely give."""" """"(It's) your own true love that I'll have and more, But thou shalt never come ashore."""" And there she floated like a swan, The salt sea bore her body on. Two minstrels walked along the strand And saw the maiden float to land. They made a harp of her breastbone, Whose sound would melt a heart of stone. They took three locks of her yellow hair, And with them strung the harp so rare. They went into her father's hall To play the harp before them all, But when they laid it on a stone The harp began to play alone. The first string sang a doleful sound: """"The bride her younger sister drowned."""" The second string as that they tried, In terror sits the black-haired bride. The third string sang beneath their bow, """"And surely now her tears will flow

La La Land,446,Aimee Allen,"I'm writing you letters
Tearing your pictures
saying goodbye
And I'm blowing a candle
trying to handle tonight
In la la land la la land
I'm in la la la la la land
la la land
So when the cheating is done
When you had all your fun
When I hate you
I'll be the one
I'll be there I will be there
I'll still be there
I'll still be in
La la land la la land
I'm dialing your number
Knowing you're with her
Just to say hi
It's hard hard to remember
We're not together
when you're mine
In la la land la la land
I'm in la la la la la land
La la land
So when the cheating is done
When you had all your fun
When they hate you
I'll be the one
And when the party ends
And you've lost all your friend
When they hate you call me again
Cause I'll be there
I will be there
I'll still be there
I'll still be in la la land

I'm in la la la la la land

This Road,753,Melissa Polinar,"Home somewhere behind me
For miles that remind me
That nothing stays the same
Scenes outside my window
Soft as a pillow
Where memories fall like rain
Maybe this road is taking
From where I was meant to be
Standing beside you
Making me smile through anything
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
So I turned around
You out in the distance
I'm skipping every exit to close
The space between
Oh
Maybe this road is taking
From where I was meant to be
Standing beside you
Making me smile through anything
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
So I turned around
I just can't get to you fast enough
Wondering how I came this far
Without your love
Maybe this road is taking
From where I was meant to be
Standing beside you
Making me smile through anything
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
So I turned around"
City Lights (Pretty Lights),423,Priscilla Ahn,"Look at me now we're on the town
Kicking up dust it's all for us
City lights pretty lights
Just take me out to play
Dressing me up is red for luck
So much to do to hide the blue
City lights pretty lights
Just wear me out they say
Buttons and ribbons
are finding their place
Smearing the makeup
I put on my face
Spiders and lizards
are tying my shoes
Whispering da da da
Finding my crutch a gentle touch
Finding my dance retreat advance
City lights pretty lights
Just ring me out to dry
Buttons and ribbons are
finding their place
Smearing the makeup
I put on my face
Spiders and lizards are
tying my shoes
Whispering da da da"
Stay,87,Estrella,"Sound straight from the twilight
Has me up all night
I can't fall asleep
'cause I keep thinking of you
And I saw a shadow outside
my window and it's you.
All my sorrows flew away
Hush, keep quiet, hear me say
I don't ever want you to go
Please stay
With the moonlight dancing free
And there's no one but you and me
There's no reason to go astray
Please stay
Making up a story
It's the way you're looking at me
If you think that this is funny,
it's just you
Try and think about it,
If you're heart is
closed don't lock,
Keep your keys
back in your pocket,
Think this through
All my sorrows flew away
Hush, keep quiet, hear me say
I don't ever want you to go
Please stay
With the moonlight dancing free
And there's no one but you and me
There's no reason to go astray
Please stay
Please stay with me
Just stay with me

Just stay"

Gracious,73,Ben Howard,"""How would you know?
When everything around you's changing like the weather
A big black storm and where'd you turn to?
Or hide a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you let me know?

'Cause I don't want to trouble your mind with the childish
Design of how it all should go, but I love you so
When it all comes clear, when the wind is settled
I'll be here, you know

'Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sand upon that place
Darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here and
Gracious goes the ghost of you, my dear

How would you know?
When everything around you's bruised and battered
Like the cold night storm and where would you turn to?
Or hide a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you tell me so?

'Cause I, I adore you so when it all comes clear
The wind is settled, I'll be here, you know
'Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sand upon that place darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you

Drops Of Jupiter (Live From San Jose / 2011),496,Taylor Swift,"Now he’s back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair hey hey hey
Acts like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there’s time to change hey hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June
hey hey
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way
to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
while you were looking for yourself
out there
Now that he’s back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation hey hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae bo
Reminds me that there’s room to grow hey hey
Now that he's back
in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that
he might think of me as
plain ol' Jane
Told a story 'bout a man who was
too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep
you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance
along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were
looking for yourself out there
Can you imagine no love
pride deep fried chicken
Your best friend always
sticking up for you
even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance
five hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that
you ever had and me
Tell me did the wind sweep
you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance
along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
while you were looking for yourself
na na na na na na na na na na
na na na oh
na na na na na na na na na na
na na na oh
Can you imagine no love
pride deep fried chicken
Your best friend always
sticking up for you
even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance

Lucky Guy,55,David Choi,"It's been so long since
I've met some one
That makes me feel this way
Makes me smile
and that's hard to do
I don't think
it's something you realize you do
You make me feel
Like I'm the only guy
With you in the world
But we can't be together
Can't really be friends
We can't be lovers
And we can't pretend
Oh that boy in your life
Better make you his wife
And he better believe
He's a lucky guy
You wanted a song
well here's one for you
Nobody will know except for us two
Don't ask me about it
Cuz I won't tell the truth
Just know that there's someone
Thinking of you
You make me feel
Something
I wish wasn't real at all
But we can't be together
Can't really be friends
We can't be lovers
And we can't pretend
Oh that boy in your life
Better make you his wife
And he better believe
He's a lucky guy
You were never mine to begin with
So we can't be together
Can't really be friends
We can't be lovers

So This Is Goodbye (Original Ver.),69,William Fitzsimmons,"The thing never now were you
You're gone and I won't see you anymore
You left my love on the run
And said that you were leaving
And you won't come home again
And you won't come home again
And I'll miss you like you're dead
But I never got to grieve you
Cause I saw you
In the arms of someone else
So your phantom follows me
Like a child would his mother
Or a lover who never said goodbye
It's only saying goodbye
And I cry myself to sleep
And you thought I was happy
I was lonely
Had nowhere to go
And I heard that you moved on
Found a brand new family
And changed your married name
And everything has changed
And I'll miss you like you're dead
And find a way to grieve you
Cause I need to
Try and start again
And your ghost will have to leave
Like a child would his mother
Or a lover
Who has to say goodbye
It's always say goodbye
It's always say goodbye
It's always say goodbye
It's always say goodbye
It's always say goodbye"
City Of Flowers,35,Adhitia Sofyan,"Pack your bags we’re leaving out of town
Wear that big black scarf wrapped around your pretty face
I’m not gonna stand here hopelessly while I see you cry
Leave those mess we’ll jump in to the car
Roll the windows down get your senses back to you
And put out that cigarette that thing will kill you slowly
And yeah it only takes two hours from here
Yeah when we get there we’ll write our brand new story
We’re going to a place I know where I was born
The city of flowers been waiting so long
Life too short you could’ve been shot
Remember this time leave your troubles behind
All your life you’ve waited for a time when that someone
To get your feet back on the ground
I’ll be that someone to help just like in that Beatles song
So here we go we’re going to a place
At the rainbows end to put some colors back on you
Let me be the gold and I will put the shine on you
And yeah we only have two exits to go
Yeah when we get there the pages will start turning
And all the lies you heard before keep coming back to you
They linger on the places you’ve longing to forget
Well I won’t lie it won’t be easy
Sometimes they’re back knocking on your door
Now you tell them that you don’t live here anymore"
Because of You (Album Version),258,Sabrina,"Want to but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real

Tell myself I'll stop everyday knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
and I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because of you And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because

Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from cause it's no good for me

Even if I did I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it

I'm Yours (Album Version),192,Sabrina,"Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but your so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks now I'm tryin to get back
before the cool done run out I'll be givin it my best test
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait
I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you're free
look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
listen to the music of the moment
people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
loved loved loved loved loved
So i won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait i'm sure
there's no need to complicate our time is short
this is our fate
I'm yours
I've been spendin' way too long checkin'
my tongue in the mirror
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
and so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'd be sayin' is there ain't no better reason
to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
it's what we aim to do
our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait
I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you're free
look into your heart and
you will find that the sky is yours
so please don't please don't please don't
there's no need to complicate
Cause our time is short
This this this is our fate
I'm yours"
Still Got The Blues,215,Eric Clapton,"It used to be so easy
to give my heart away
I found out the hard way
There's a price I have to pay
I found in that love's
no friend of mine
I should have known
better time after time
It was so long so long ago
But I've still got the
blues for you
It used to be so easy to
fall in love again
I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found in that love was
more than just a game
I was playin' to win
But losin' just the same
It was so long so long ago
But I've still got the
blues for you
So many years since
I've seen your face
Here in my heart
there's an empty space
Where you used to be
Well it was so
long so long ago
But I've still got the
blues for you
Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you"
The Everlasting Good,617,Jesper Munk,"I see a black tree waving in the wind
While my heart whispers another sin
She has all you could want and more
But I couldn't have it
cause I'd probably lost it all
Coffee and beer
and a bottle of white wine and dine
Is all we need and a sip
of the everlasting cigarette
The everlasting cigarette
I'm a black hat with a dog
A soulhound covered in a
red wine dress
And your kiss it feels like
rainbows on my lips
And the fate forms a fist
Coffee and beer
and a bottle of white wine and dine
Is all we need and a sip
of the everlasting cigarette
The everlasting cigarette
Coffee and beer
and a bottle of white wine and dine
Is all we need and a sip
of the everlasting cigarette
The everlasting cigarette
For in my way it lies
But I can't hear it cause I'm blind
Just help me out here and get closer
For in my way it lies
But I can't hear it cause I'm blind
Just help me out here and get closer"
Cherry Blossom Rain,275,Elsa Kopf,"it's not a sigh
it's not a tear
it's over there and over here
it's like a kiss that flies away
tangled in cherry blossom rain
you know my face
you know my heart
in little pieces torn apart
I let them fall down the plane
they turn to cherry blossom rain
cherry blossom
cherry blossom rain
cherry blossom
cherry blossom rain
and if there's one thing I know
is that I don't know where to
land
with my two tiny paper wings
oh what is this thing
if it's not love
if it's not pain
it's just a cherry blossom
a cherry blossom
cherry blossom rain
it's not a sigh it's not a tear
it's over there and over here
it's like a kiss that flies away
tangled in cherry blossom rain
cherry blossom
cherry blossom rain
cherry blossom

Just trying to break through
trying to make you mine

don't want to get burnt

Even If,139,Lewis Watson,"Even if i apologise

Although
It's all i have to give you
It's called a big mistake
It's called a bad choice made
Then comes the slippery slide
To no kiss goodbye
Even if i apologise
I know
I got a hill to climb
And i know
That i'll never quite convince you
Even if i apologise
I know
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all i have to give you

Makes my regret grow worse
And i'd smash the whole thing down
If i could turn it round
Even if i apologise
I know
I got a hill to climb
And i know
That i'll never quite convince you
Even if i apologise
I know

Although
It's all i have to give you
So i'll just stand here broken
'cause i haven't had any sleep
And i'm forcing my eyes open
To see reality
And the colours that i'm made of
Are pouring out of me
But i can't run away
From a big mistake
No i can't run away
From a big mistake
Even if i apologise
I know
I got a hill to climb
And i know
That i'll never quite convince you
Even if i apologise
I know
That's not enough sometimes

you’ll show up in my view
telling me not to worry
then I wake up and find my way back to reality
I hear the clock, it’s ticking
late at night it’s teasing me oooo
I can feel the pressure
seeping deep inside of me
take it easy
go right ahead & don’t forget to breathe
though it’s not all that perfect
it’s not always make it or break it

go on ahead, don’t be afraid to feel
no, i don’t have all the answers

i’m GOnna take it easy
what have I become
am I still the same me
Is this the place where I want to be
Wherever I go I try to find a place
a home for my heart’s rhythm
hear the clock, it’s tickin’
late at night it’s callin’ me ooooh
I can see the future
that is where you’re taking me
take my time, enjoy the ride take it easy
we’ll be fine, all will align take it take it take it"
Drive Darling (Acoustic),781,Boy,"You close the door
and start the motor
I roll the window down
I raise my hand and wave goodbye
To neighborhood queens
and clowns and
Children in the front yards
They hide and seek and laugh
I can almost hear you thinking
How could these days go by so fast
And no rear view could picture
What we leave behind
Drive darling drive darling
Drive darling drive darling
drive
A silent conversation
No words cause there's no need
We let the tapes mix up the years
And press repeat and press repeat
The trunk is filled with records
And books and tears and clothes
I'm smiling on the surface
I'm scared as hell below
And no rear view could picture
What we leave behind
Drive darling drive darling
Drive darling drive darling
drive
Good morning freedom
Good night lullabies
Drive darling drive darling
Drive darling drive darling
drive
And when we arrive
The hardest of goodbyes
You will dry my eyes
Somehow you're always by my side
The one who holds my kite
And watches over all my flights
Drive darling drive darling
Drive darling drive darling
drive
Good morning freedom
Good night lullabies
Drive darling drive darling
Drive darling drive darling
drive
Drive darling drive darling
Drive darling drive darling
drive"

Party Girl,140,Dan + Shay,"All them boys are spraying down and shining their wheels, and all them girls are getting pretty putting on heels;
'Cause downtown there's a cover band warming up for the fever jam, blondes' in the bathroom washing x's off their hands
All of them party people stacking up in a line
Pushing up on each other like it's raining outside
But I'ma stay right here so we can disappear
Yeah I've been waiting all night
Take me to the party girl in the same t shirt
that you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that were spinning bare feet on the floor in the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty Queen long legs and all
got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl
I don't need all them humming, buzzing neon signs
Long as you got that come and get me look in your eyes
Yeah I'ma stay right here so we can disappear
We can do it up right
Take me to the party girl in the same t shirt
that you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that were spinning bare feet on the floor in the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty Queen long legs and all
got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl
Take me to the party girl, wearing nothing but that t shirt
Laying down on an old love seat, nothing better than you and me
And that party girl in the same t shirt
that you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that were spinning bare feet on the floor in the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty Queen long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl
Ain't nothing better than you and me, girl
Yeah, so gimme that gimme that girl"
Love,308,Jana Kramer,"I still believe in fairy tales
I still believe in picking flowers
I still believe in getting lost
in someone’s eyes
And talking for hours
I still believe in shooting stars
I still believe in midnight drives
And butterflies you get
Right before you kiss
for the very first time
Love how many times
can a heart break
Love how much weight
can a soul take
Love I don’t know
where you ran off to
But love love love
I still believe in you
I still believe in miracles
I still believe in wedding rings
and bibles
I still believe the best walk
you’ll ever take
Is walking down the aisle
Love how many times
can a heart break
Love how much weight
can a soul take
Love I don’t know
where you ran off to
But love love love
I still believe in you
Yeah I still believe in you
I still believe
that you’ll come knocking
on my door
When I least expect you to
You give me something I can hold
You pull me through
cuz that’s what you do
That’s what you do love
Yeah that’s what you do love
Love how many times

Love how much weight

Stay,693,Lewis Watson,"When I close my eyes I hear you singing
Singing me a song that I'll forget
I always forget
I try to take myself back to sleeping
You pick me up but I let you down
It was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay
Staystay
If only I could dream we could start again 2x
Ooohhh oooh
When I close my eyes I see you dancing
Dancing me a song
Just out of reach, just out of reach
I need you in a day when I'm not dreaming
You pick me up
I don't wanna let you down
It was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay
Staystay
If only I could dream we could start again 2x
Ooohhh oooh
It was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay

If only I could dream we could start again
Stay
If only I could dream we could start again
Stay
If only I could dream we could start again 2x"
Little Darling,57,Lewis Watson,"Summer girl in the winter time
Your pretty eyes I pictured in the fading light
Little darling, little darling
You're mine
We walked for hours
Lost track of time
But I bought you flowers
So never let them die, no, no
Little darling, little darling
You're mine
Little darling
Little darling
You're mine
You're far away now
But you're on my mind
I'll never put a thing above you
You're my guiding light
Little darling, little darling
You're mine
Little darling
Little darling
You're mine
You'll never have to worry
And I'll tell you why
I'll never find a girl quite like you
I hope you realize
You're mine
You're mine
Little darling
Little darling
You're mine"

Je m'ennuie,26,Rose,"On est encore rentré tard alcoolisé
On a noyé nos vie dans des verres teintés
De peurs bleues, de colères noires
Et l'on a ri, à n'en plus pouvoir

Les yeux mis-clos, les cheveux collés au front
Comme toutes ces pensées qui nous collent aux talons
Pourquoi ça fout l'cafard et les j'tons
De rester dans le noir, à compter les moutons..

[Refrain]
Et nos visages gris, quand le matin nous prend
En flagrant délit de perte de temps
Et nos regards hagards, lorsque la nuit s'endort
Et que le jour nous donne, tous les torts

[Couplet]
Qu'est-ce qui cloche chez moi ?
J'déconne à tours de bras
J'ai vomi ma haine sur vos regards
Paraît même qu' j'étais pas belle à voir
Qu'est-ce qui m'fout la trouille
Suffisamment pour qu'la nuit me dépouille
De ma raison, de tous mes sens
De ma maison, de mon essence

[Refrain]
Et nos visages gris quand le matin nous prend
En flagrant délit, de perte de temps
Et nos regards hagards, lorsque la nuit s'endort
Et que le jour nous donne, tous les torts

[Couplet]
C'est décidé cette fois j'arrête tout
J'me pose, j'me couche tôt, j'garde mes sous
Si j'ai un faible pour les alcools forts
Peut-être disparaît-il si je dors ?
J'arrête de disjoncter pour un oui pour un con
J'prends sur moi, j'échange mes talons aiguilles
Contre une vieille paire de baskets
J'aurai p't'être moins envie de faire la fête..

Mais j'm'ennuie, j'm'ennuie, j'm'ennuie..
Hmm... Mais j'm'ennuie..."
Marrow (Late Night Tape Ver.),77,Ezra Vine,"I don't even mind if the angels come by
take my arms in their arms
draw me out above the neon wild where I
I dissolve, I dissolve
Reeling, my thoughts unwind
they trail off in a line
there's buzzards in my head where there once was a fire
and sparks and sparks and I
Let me lay down on your table
watch the sand fall, the trickle of time
won't you help me kill what ails
Come and kiss me pull the wool over my eyes
Feeling kinda tired by the window tonight
Heavy eyes, heavy eyes
sick of recollecting what has broken my stride
and I never mind, never mind
I tasted marrow, dirt on that halo
I woke up in July to a dizzying light
the angels and wings and I
feathers and wings and I
San Diego, California
I don't remember, no, and I don't recall ya
complicated, anaesthetised
been awake for days and I don't know why
so let me lay down on your table
I'll watch the sand fall, the trickle of time
Won't you help me numb my mind
Come and kiss me pull the wool over my eyes
Tranquilize
I lie and think of evergreens
of winter voices and falling leaves
relax my palms and greet the night
a rush of heat as the needle finds
my bloodlines
my bloodlines
so never mind
I don't even mind if the angels come by, take my arms in their arms
there's buzzards in my head where there once was a fire
and sparks and sparks and sparks and sparks
and sparks and sparks and sparks and sparks
and sparks and sparks and sparks"
I Don't Want To Change You,"1,585",Damien Rice,"Wherever you are
you know that I adore you
No matter how far well
I can go before you
If ever you need someone
what not that you need help in
But if ever you want someone
you know that I am willing
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across an angel
out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye
Wherever you go
I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
if it's a lot to swallow
If you just wanna be alone
I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
I am more than willing
'Cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across some angel
out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across some angel
out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye
I've never been with anyone
in the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun
then it's doomed
'Cause water races
water races down
The waterfalls water races
water races down
The waterfalls
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across some angel
where there is no danger
Where love has eyes it is not blind"
Long Long Way,660,Damien Rice,"Long long way to the top
Long way down if you fall
And it's a long way back if you get lost
Long way out to the end
Long way to go to lose your friends
It's a long way to haul all the traps you've trawled
When you could just stop and let go
But you say
Not now, maybe later
But not now, maybe later
Not now, maybe later
You're only in your way
But not now, maybe later
You're only in your way
Not now, maybe later
You're only in your way
But not now, maybe later
You're only in your way
But not now, maybe wait
You're only in your way
'Cause love is tough
When enough is not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough"
The Highest Tides,415,Jesse Barrera,"I’ll see you
on the other side
Our broken hearts
riding the highest tides
And our love will sing
to the goodnight moon
I’ll say goodbye
The sweetest one I ever knew
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll be seeing you
Late night rides and alley ways
Cigarettes
late night talks and ashtrays
Broken records out of tune
You look deeply in my eyes
You were a dream
that I got so lost inside
I’ll see you
on the other side
Our broken hearts
riding the highest tides
And our love will sing
to the goodnight moon
I’ll say goodbye
The sweetest one I ever knew
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll surely miss
you walkin’ up to my door
Greeted with that
beautiful smile that I’ll miss
Could only think of
kissing your face once more
I’ll miss the first time
you said hello
But now they’re memories
that I can’t let go
Pieces of you that I’ll hold
I’ll see you
on the other side
Our broken hearts
riding the highest tides
And our love will sing
to the goodnight moon
I’ll say goodbye
The sweetest one I ever knew
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll be seeing you"
Fly,68,Maddie & Tae,"Baby blue staring in the window pane
Just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she's got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress
Now her heart's a mess
Praying she will find a way to make it
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
Searching for a sign in the night even like a lonely string of lights
That'll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road's been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There's more to this than just the breath you're breathing
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
On the way down
You won't forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath and fly
Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
Oh oh, oh oh
Fly
Fly"

to find me again
Wonder if you're the old ship

The howling night will pass by
Oh we'll steal the verse
Calling on shadows
And calling on shadows
Be there
Oh let us stay
don't let our small dresses
get rose
We move in circles of light
Carry your shape
in the light of the cold
Let us return to the edge
of the storm
Give us a way to bring
all our bodies home
Let us return to the edge
of the light
In circles"

So we're taking them on red dirt place somewhere offroad

I'll tell you right where we are

No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Round here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire

Girls showing up late as always
Now it's a party
Cut off sun dresses, they're ready to go
Don't need no dance road tonight
Just country music and good times

An American Dream (Remastered 2001) (Feat. Linda Ronstadt),76,The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"I beg your pardon, mama, what did you say
My mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay
It's not that I'm not interested, you see
Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be

I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove

Keep on talking, mama, I can hear
Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear

I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove

Voila An American Dream
Well, we can travel girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign

Just keep talking, mama, I like that sound
It goes so easy with that rain falling down
I think a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear

Voila An American Dream
Yeah, we can travel, girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign

Just think Jamaican in the moonlight

Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you

[Pre-Chorus]
These are real things
These are real things

[Chorus 2]
Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

[Outro]
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe"
Space Cowboy,337,Kacey Musgraves,"You look out the window while I look at you
Saying ""I don't know""
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy"

Alone Together,446,Dan + Shay,"I couldn't help
but notice you were sitting
by yourself
Dropping limes in a Corona
like you're trying to get
over somebody else
It's funny how your story
sounds a little like mine
Oh cause' I've been at a table
with a bottle peeling labels
to pass the time
We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up
songs all night
We can say goodbye just head home
But if we're going to be alone
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up
against my car door parked
outside on the street
where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
I couldn't help but notice
you could use another drink
Yeah I don't wanna leave ya
And it's two for one Tequila
so what you think
We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up
songs all night
We can say goodbye just head home
But if we're going to be alone
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up
against my car door parked
outside on the street
where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
oh yeah
We should be alone together
Over there in the corner
where nobody else can see
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
oh yeah
We should be alone together"
She Got the Best of Me,650,Luke Combs,"Seventeen
you don't think
that much about life
You just live it
Like Kerosene dancing
around a fire
But you're in it
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something
new worth living for
And a old dusty hand-me-down
six string
And a couple chords
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing a-long
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me"
Lost In The Middle,388,Catherine McGrath,"Sitting on the back
of a crowded train
Count raindrops falling
on the window pane
Had the worst damn longest
craziest day today
Only one way I know
to get out of this place
Don't need no car or a ticket
or a plane
Just close my eyes
let the music carry me away
And I put my headphones on
Turn the real world off
And I get lost in the middle
of a country song
And they're singing 'bout the guy
with the blue ripped jeans
And he's standing right there
in front of me
And they're singing
'bout a small town Saturday night
Dancing in the dirt glitter in the sky
I had my first real kiss all over again
And he's spinning me around
in my little red dress
All I gotta do is put these
headphones on
And I'm lost in the middle
of a country song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Had somebody pick me
up and drop me off
Had a boombox party
in a parking lot
Or a beach fire
all night sing along I'm gone
When I put my headphones on
Turn the real world off
And I get lost in the middle
of a country song
And they're singing 'bout the guy
with the blue ripped jeans
And he's standing right there
in front of me
And they're singing
'bout a small town Saturday night
Dancing in the dirt glitter in the sky
I had my first real kiss all over again
And he's spinning me around
in my little red dress
All I gotta do is put
these headphones on
And I'm lost in the middle
of a country song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Lost
in the middle of a country song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sitting on the back
of a crowded train
Count raindrops falling
on the window pane
Had the worst damn longest
craziest day today
Then I hear them singing
'bout the guy with
the blue ripped jeans
And he's standing right
there in front of me
And they're singing
'bout a small town Saturday night

I had my first real kiss all over again

And I'm lost in the middle
of a country song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh can't stop
singing along singing along
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh can't stop
singing along singing along
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost in the middle of a country song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh can't stop
singing along singing along
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Can't stop

Too many lights on in the street
I can see the way that you're looking at me
And the way you're slipping off your Jimmy Choo's, like you wanted to since we got here
Now, we're driving down the highway, pulling into my place
Got your hand over my knee
Now that we're alone
I'm gonna let you know everything you mean to me

Chorus
There's no such thing as too much money
'Cause if I had it all I would spend it on you, honey
Time on your hands baby I can take it off ya, let me take it off ya

There ain't a second that I don't want to hold your body on my body

Over Rainbows and Rainier,35,Damien Jurado,"The angel Moroni asleep in the carport
With the newspaper under his arm
It seems I was late to deliver his car keys
So it looks like we are staying behind
Was Lucifer bashful in hiding his face from the Lord
Dear Jesus, forgive me, I am only doing as I was told

For as it is written, I will soon one day face my own fire
And this world will go with me, if I can just get them all on my side

Carry me over rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over rainbows and Rainier

I was late to the parlor
When the wind it blew forward
And demanded we get out of town
So me and Moroni took the keys to the steeple
And awaited Armageddon to go down
Place your queens on the table
Who are weeping for your daughters
Who are waiting for their someday to return
Every heart will be broken
Prophetic poems spoken
From the mouths of every baby to be born

Carry me over rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over rainbows and Rainier

Let your cries be of joy
May it always and forever fill the void
And allow my heart some room
May it be so that you'll one day need me soon

With my wheels in a turning
And my back to the window
I collected every wave from the shore
I forgot I was human as I laid up my emotions
And I knocked them like dishes to the floor

Carry me over rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over rainbows and Rainier"
Cartoon People,348,Billie Marten,"It doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
It's bigger than the rest of us
he'll promise you that
I'm glad I'm glad
He's picking up the drinks
and then he's knocking them back
I've never seen someone
who wears a sad little
mask like that
like that
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his hand
Is busy today with
someone else's plans
He chooses life and then
she chooses a man
It doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
In any case I look at him
my life ain't half as bad as bad
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his hand
Is busy today with
someone else's plans
He chooses life and then
she chooses a man
He's picking it up
but she don't give a damn
Hold me it's a crisis that
we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting
an American war
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away
Hold me it's a crisis that
we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting

She Dances,365,Billie Marten,"Oh my lonely heart
she could hang around for days
Will never leave the house
something more than just a phase
She'd eat occasionally
just like she would
when she’s alone
She'll play the game for free
until she dies until she dies
She howls she dances
She howls as she does
She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
Just like a wolf
And as she reads aloud
ankles hanging off the bed
She'll read to nobody
or was it something that she said
She is like the trees the sun
that creeps through my window
She knows her body
the kind that turns you into gold
She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
Just like a wolf
And I’m jealous of her feet
The way she runs from nobody
The way she walks right
through the sea
And how she'll make you weep
Oh my lonely heart
she could hang around for days
Will never leave the house
something more than just a phase
She'd eat occasionally
just as she likes
She'll play the game for free
until she dies until she dies

Moon on the Water,32,Passenger,"Well will you fill my head with stories
'Til I close my eyes and dream
until the dawn
And when I'm sleeping
tell me secrets
Tell me things
you've never told no one before
And when you wake up
hiding nothing
Maybe you'll know
how it feels to be born
I could wake up feeling something
for the first time in so long
And we could walk down
towards the sea
In the new shoes I bought you
Stay there for all of the day
While the sun plays on the water
Well will you fill me with excitement
Like the feeling that
we felt on Christmas Eve
When we didn't know to laugh
or to cry in to our sleeves
And I know some things are not real
But in you I truly feel I believe
When we lie down on your bed
I press my head down on your chest
and hear you breathe
Well I know it's late
but let's go to the sea
I know a way that is shorter
And we could sink out under the stars
You can wear my woolen jumper
And we can sink out in to the stones
you can lay upon my shoulder
And we could stay
there all of the night
While the moon rests on the water
While the moon rests on the water
While the moon rests on the water"

Morning in LA,139,Will Fox,"Don't go resting your eyes
It's not time to dream yet
Don't you leave us behind
There is so much you'd regret
But I feel so far away
When your night is my morning in LA
Bad news makes it before I can wake
When your night is my morning in LA
Don't go resting your eyes
It's not time it's not time to dream yet
There's a mountain to climb
Take it one step at a time

When your night is my morning in LA
Bad news makes it before I can wake
When your night is my morning in LA
When your night is my morning in LA"
Forever Ain't Long Enough,317,Adam Hambrick,"For all the times
I get watch you
checkin' your shades
in that side view mirror
For all the times
I get wake up next to you
tangled up in my sheets
For every walk on the boulevard
with you on my arm
every head turning like
Who's that girl
You'd think I'd get tired
of it eventually
But forever ain't long enough
For the fire that
I have in my heart for you
No there ain't enough ticks
on the clock
To do all of the things that
I wanna do with you
I never wanna stop
Tastin' heaven on your lips
when you're kissi'g me
Baby even if I had an eternity
To give you all of my love yeah
Forever ain't long enough
Oh forever ain't long enough
Now baby I can't apologize
for keepin' you up
a little late past midnight
Sleep is way overrated in comparison
to starin' in your baby blues
Every sunset view Wanna drag it out
It always ends too soon My love
Forever ain't long enough
For the fire that
I have in my heart for you
No there ain't enough
ticks on the clock
To do all of the things that
I wanna do with you
I never wanna stop
Tastin' heaven on your lips
when you're kissin' me
Baby even if I had an eternity
To give you all of my love yeah
Forever ain't long enough yeah
Forever ain't
Forever ain't
Forever ain't
Forever ain't
Forever ain't

Oh forever ain't long enough
For the fire that
I have in my heart for you

Will I See You Tonight? (feat. Vashti Bunyan),40,Devendra Banhart,"Will I see you tonight
Been waiting my whole life
I’ve had this dream inside
Of looking in your eyes

In this far away place
Where just saying your name
Gets me drunk on distance
& every night feels the same

Now I’m longing for the word
The one I’ve never known
A vast solstice of flowers
That are all rightfully yours

& I love you the way
I want everyone to know
How very much I love them
But never told them so

Your soul is where the light
Goes begging door to door
Goes begging door to door"

Heartbeat,391,SAILR,"I woke up with you on my mind
Watched the air turn as you breathe
Yellow morning filling up your eyes
Waking up the life in me
You set my soul on fire
You pull my heartbeat towards the sun
You give me new eyes open
You call my heartbeat into love
There’s a quiet moving in your ways
It’s a peace I’ve never known
Build my anchor throw it in your waves
Slow it down and call you home
You set my soul on fire
You pull my heartbeat towards the sun
You give me new eyes open
You call my heartbeat into love
You set my soul on fire
You pull my heartbeat towards the sun
You give me new eyes open
You call my heartbeat into love"
Island Of Doom,97,Agnes Obel,"Destiny made her way and found you in a room
They told me, they told me
To undo the rule of mind and body
Nature laughed away as their voices grew
They told me, they told me
Clean out the room and bury the body

Chorus
But I know you with a heartbeat
So how does the night feel
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
But now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
But now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

Verse 2
I haven't walked for days though I wanted to
You told me, you told me
For with every move the feeling follows
In nature's empty face, I am of little use
You told me, you told me
I'm just another fool for the earth to swallow

Bridge
But the road through most will lead you back
And I will be with you
For the road of your mind will eat you up
On your island of doom
Where the voices all have gathered up
To a choir of fools
But I know my mind will reach you there
And I will be with you

Chorus
Oh, I know you with a heartbeat
So how does the night feel
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
And now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
And now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
Ooh, why'd you wake me up today
Ooh, why'd you wake me up today
Ooh, when the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
Ooh, when the lights fade out
When the lights fade out
Ooh, when the lights fade out

I Hope You’re Happy Now,158,Carly Pearce,"It's all on me it's my mistake
I said I don't love you
a little too late
But I guess there ain't
ever a right time
And I don't know
why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the
door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better
I hope you find
what you were looking for
I hope your heart
ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on
all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now
Who knew this heart
could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was
what you wanted
Well I guess you found
what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't
worth it anymore
I'm a wreck I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now
I hope you find what
you were looking for
I guess my heart
ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on
all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now
Happy now
Oh I hope you're happy now"
Garden Song,62,Phoebe Bridgers,"Someday I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframe

I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies
I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No, I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted"

Thinking About You,6,Ocie Elliott,"On the day that I left you
In sweet Monterrey
I realized something
You'll never be far away

I'll be thinking about you all my days
I'll be thinking about you all the way
And I don't know when you got in my head
But I'm not going to let you fade

Give me your eyes baby
Give me your heart too
Give me your affection now
Give me all of you

I'll be thinking about you all my days
I'll be thinking about you all the way
And I'm not sure how, but you're in me now
And I know that you're there to stay

And your loving makes me lose my place
I can not get enough of your face
The way you come to me in the night
I just want to hold you tight

I'll be thinking about you all my days
I'll be thinking about you all my days
I'll be thinking about you all my days
I'll be thinking about you"
Smoke & Ash,51,Canyon City,"Woke up cold the smell of smoke & ash
Of fires bright and burned away
Your notes still ringing in my ears I guess
A choir louder every day

[Pre-Chorus]
All my words are caught beneath my tongue
All my lines still hid somewhere deep in my lungs and

[Chorus]
Oh my chest says it's not over just yet
Oh my mind guesses it's not clear ask again
Both my feet seem to wanna lead straight to your door
But oh my eyes see you're not here anymore

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting on your hearts arrest
After all those wanted signs
Plastered everywhere I go, confess
The breath you broke in and stole was mine

[Pre-Chorus]
All my words are caught beneath my tongue
All my lines still hid somewhere deep in my lungs and

[Chorus]
Oh my chest says it's not over just yet
Oh my mind guesses it's not clear ask again
Both my feet seem to wanna lead straight to your door
But oh my eyes see you're not here anymore

[Bridge]
And no one wants to leave
With broken bones but we
Can't help but fall sometimes

[Chorus]
Oh my chest says it's not over just yet
Oh my mind guesses it's not clear ask again
Both my feet seem to wanna lead straight to your door
But oh my eyes see you're not here anymore
You're not here anymore
You're not here anymore"

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing

Verse 3
It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

Verse 4
We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing"

If Only,25,Matilda Mann,"I shouldn't look for someone like you
Who daydreams too much about wasting their youth
And I shouldn't care, and I shouldn't care, but I do
And I shouldn't stay up until 2 AM
Hopelessly wondering what I can mend
And I shouldn't care, and I shouldn't stare, but I do
And if only I was somebody you wanted
Just for the day, but you wanted
Someone you know that wouldn't leave
I know that's never been me
Strange how you don't know just how I think
'Cause I read your mind like it's written with ink
Scribbles and mess, but lines that still play with my heart
And if only I was somebody you wanted
Just for the day, but you wanted
Someone you know that wouldn't leave
I know it's not what you need
I wrote your name seventeen times
Just to figure out when, figure out why
And it's starting again, it's strange, I don't know
Why you would stay if you knew you would go
And you called out to me, desperately weak
With something to say, if you only could speak
And I tried to pretend, I just can't deny
That I'd lie just for you if you passed me tonight
If only I was somebody you wanted
Just for the day, but you wanted
Someone you know that wouldn't leave
I know that'd never be me
I know that'd never be me"

Hey Driver (feat. The War and Treaty),20,Zach Bryan,"Alright man I’m ready when y’all are
This is your song mike let’s do it
Here we go, 1, 2, 3, eh

So take me down a road thats a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere

Hey driver, pull on over I’m in a fight with god
This Carolina shoulder seems the place I’m getting off
Daddy always told me, never make a home on the road
While your lady’s sneaking out and the kids are growing old

Hey driver, I’ve been riding this lonely way too long
All the love I have worth giving is all spent on my songs
Hey driver, the boys are gambling with more than just their cards
With their bottles and their drugs and their bibles and their hearts

So take me down a road thats a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere

Hey driver, I’ve been feeling like there’s no point at all
The klonopin ain’t kicked in and I missed my sisters call
Hey driver I’m so tired of the ways of this old world
Just drive until the tires melt we’ll come back when it’s healed

So take me down a road thats a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere
So take me down a road thats a little bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere
Hey driver you can drop me off anywhere"

Loneliness,5,Bear's Den,"It won’t let you down easy
It’ll let you down with lead weights pulling either side
And as you fall under
You’ll be fighting for breath with all you've got

As you fall & you flounder
Calling for help won’t help you none
You sink into the song
Like a fire drowning in a setting sun

You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over all of this”

If I should, call your name
Would you hear me out at all?
If I should, call your name
Would you hear me out at all?

As the waves turn to thunder
You look for a rock that could hold you up
And as you get close
You realise that you’re all that rock has got

You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what Loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you - ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over all of this”

You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what Loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you - ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over all of this”

And it is what it is
Love taught me what Loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you - ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over this shit
But I’m not”"

night just empty streets
And me walking home to clear my head
I know it came as no surprise
I'm affected more than I had guessed
on what was said
If the smile's not meant to be,
if the heart's not ready to open
If we make it I won't see it's broken
If the smile's not meant to be,
if the heart's not ready to open
If we make it I won't see how it's broken
It's the quiet time before the dawn
and I'm half past making sense of it,
was I wrong?
Should I claim to give it all ?
in a world where not much
ever seems to last long
If the smile's not meant to be,
if the heart's not ready to open
If we make it I won't see it's broken
if the smile's not meant to be
If the heart's not ready to open
if we make it I won't
See how it's broken
How it's broken
How it's broken
How it's broken
If the smile's not meant to be
If the heart's not ready to open
If we make it I won't see it's broken
If the smile's not meant to be,
if the heart's not ready to open
If we make it I won't see how it's broken

A Running Start,26,Sufjan Stevens,"If I imagine myself peaceful
On the fire escape
Head first, my hands inside my
T-shirt, as we run away
So now we have a running start
My body moves in mystic ways
I cross my arms to shield my heart
As everything turns into waves

I see the light upon the lake
The silver moon, the water snake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish

If I align myself with Pisces
In a funny way
Can you, my lover, kiss my bracelet
And my shoulder blades
We’ve always had a running start
I jump between the trampolines
You throw your arms around my heart
As if to say you’re all I need

The winter pines, the lonely drake
The light beneath the frozen lake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish"

Stay Stay Stay,223,Taylor Swift,"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)"
Starlight,286,Taylor Swift,"I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, ""Look at you
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""

Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"
Begin Again,273,Taylor Swift,"Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you threw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again"
Come Back...Be Here,321,Taylor Swift,"You said it in a simple way
4AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come, back be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here"
Red (Original Demo Recording),164,Taylor Swift,"Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red

His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street"

Help the Poor,191,Eric Clapton,"Help the poor
Won't you help poor me
I need help from you baby
Need it desperately
I need you so much
I need your care
Need all the loving
baby you can spare
Help the poor
Oh, baby won't you help poor me
Say you will
Say you'll help me on
I can't make it no longer
In this world alone
Baby I'm beggin' with
tears in my eyes
For your love don't you realize
I need help
Oh baby help poor me
You are my inspiration
Baby that's makes be a king
But if you don't come to my rescue
I couldn't ever be anything
Help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Have a heart won't you baby
Listen to my plead
Oh I lost my courage
till I found you
You got what it takes baby
To pull me through
Help the poor
Oh baby won't you help poor me

You are my inspiration

All I Want,219,Joni Mitchell,"I am on a lonely road
and i am traveling
Traveling traveling traveling
Looking for something
what can it be
Oh i hate you some
i hate you some
I love you some
Oh i love you
when i forget about me
I want to be strong
i want to laugh along
I want to belong to the living
Alive alive
i want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings
in some juke box dive
Do you want
do you want
do you want
To dance with me baby
Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding
some sweet romance
with me baby
Well come on
All i really really want
our love to do
Is to bring out the best
in me and in you too
All i really really want
our love to do
Is to bring out the best
in me and in you
I want to talk to you
i want to shampoo you
I want to renew you
again and again
Applause applause
life is our cause
When i think of your kisses
My mind see saws
Do you see
do you see
do you see
How you hurt me baby
So i hurt you too
Then we both get so blue
I am on a lonely road
and i am traveling
Looking for the key
to set me free
Oh the jealousy
the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy
that could be
I want to have fun
i want to shine like the sun
I want to be the one
that you want to see
I want to knit you a sweater
Want to write you a love letter
I want to make you feel better
I want to make you feel free
Want to make you feel free
I want to make you feel free"
My Old Man,214,Joni Mitchell,"My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
He's my sunshine
in the morning
He's my fireworks
at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord
I ever heard
Play that warm chord
play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No my old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No my old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues"
This Flight Tonight,43,Joni Mitchell,"Look out the left
the captain said
The lights down there
that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the las vegas sands
It wasn't the one
that you gave to me
That night down south
between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors
Oh starbright starbright
You've got the lovin' that i like
all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on
this flight tonight
You got the touch
so gentle and sweet
But you've got
that look so critical
Now i can't talk to you baby
I get so weak
Sometimes i think
love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven
Down there's a town
Blackness everywhere
and little lights shine
Oh blackness
blackness dragging me down
Come on light the candle
in this poor heart of mine
Oh starbright starbright
You've got the lovin' that i like
all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't hove got on
this flight tonight
I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing goodbye baby
baby goodbye
Ooh ooh love is blind
Up go the flaps
down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat
turned on baby
I hope they finally fixed
your automobile
I hope it's better
when we meet again baby
Starbright starbright
You got the lovin' that i like
all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on
this flight tonight"
Sweet Dreams,61,Roy Buchanan,"Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me it's plain
I should have known I'd never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Why can't I forget the past
Start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about you"

Hold Your Light High,14,Terrible Sons,"You had hope in the morning
So much hope in the morning

And who wouldn’t want a good, good life?
All us felons want a better life

Now the sunlight won’t touch you
(Hold your light high, don’t let it down)
You don’t feel no warmth at all
(Hold your light high, don’t let it down)

And who wouldn’t want a good, good life
All us felons want a better life

When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
Hold your light high, don't let it down

Can you see through the choke smoke
Can you see through the haze at all
There is pain in the offering
My hands are small but they are yours

And who wouldn’t want a good, good life
All us felons want a better life

When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
When you hands feel tired
Hold your light high, don't let it down"

Another Sleepless Night,23,Anne Murray,"The nights have been so lonely since you went away
I could not get to sleep try as I may
But now you're back, and you're here to stay....


Still it looks like another sleepless night
Oh but darlin', that's alright Just as long as you are holdin' me tight
Makin' love 'till the early morning light
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night

Hold me, while the moon shines in through the window
Let your love flow
Hold me, we can orchestrate love's scenario with the radio

Still it looks like another sleepless night
Oh but darlin', that's alright
Just as long as you are holdin' me tight



Hold me, while the moon shines...etc"
Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,81,Robben Ford,"Baby, do you understand me now, sometimes I feel a little mad
And don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong your bound to see the bad

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree with a joy that's hard to hide
Then sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And you're bound to see the other side

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem mean to you, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing that I never mean to do, 'cause I love you

Oh baby, don't you know I'm human
I have faults like any other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
Some foolish little sinful thing I've done

And I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem mean to you, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing that I never mean to do, 'cause I love you

Baby, don't you know I'm human
I have faults like any other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
Some foolish little sinful thing I've done

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood"
"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy",45,Leonard Cohen,"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy
It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
looking ate the Late Late show
through a semi-precious stone.
In the House of Honesty
her father was on trial,
in the House of Mystery
there was no one at all,
there was no one at all.
It seems so long ago,
none of us were strong;
Nancy wore green stockings
and she slept with everyone.
She never said she'd wait for us
although she was alone,
I think she fell in love for us
in nineteen sixty one,
in nineteen sixty one.

It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
a forty five beside her head,
an open telephone.
We told her she was beautiful,
we told her she was free
but none of us would meet her in
the House of Mystery,
the House of Mystery.

And now you look around you,
see her everywhere,
many use her body,
many comb her hair.
In the hollow of the night
when you are cold and numb
you hear her talking freely then,
she's happy that you've come,
she's happy that you've come."
How Do I Live,263,Trisha Yearwood,"How do I get through
the night without you
If I had to live without you
What kinda life
would that be
Oh I need you in my arms
need you to hold
You're my world
my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything good in my life

Without you
There would be no sun
in my sky
There would be no love
in my life
There would be no world
left for me
And I baby
I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live

If you ever leave
Baby you would
take away everything
Need you with me
Baby don't you know
that you are
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live
How do I live without you"
Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident),6,John Michael Montgomery,"Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction
Where I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution

Well, the auctioneer was goin' about a mile a minute
He was takin' bids an' callin' them out loud
An' I guess I was really gettin' in it
'Cause I just shouted out above the crowd!

An' I said, hey, pretty lady, won'cha gi'me a sign

Well she won my heart it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!

Yeah, we found love on the auction block
An' I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about
The way we met that day

Give Me One Reason,163,Tracy Chapman,"Give me one reason to stay here and I?ll turn right back around

Said I don?t want to leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby I got your number and I know that you got mine
You know that I called you I called too many times
You can call me baby
You can call me anytime, but you got to call me

Give me one reason to stay here and I?ll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here and I?ll turn right back around
Said I don?t want to leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

I don?t want no one reason to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I don?t want no one reason to squeeze me
They might take away my life

I just want someone to hold me
And rock me through the night
This youthful heart can love you and give what you need
This youthful heart can love you and give what you need
But I?m too old to go chasing you around wasting my precious energy

Give me one reason to stay here and I?ll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here and I?ll turn right back around
Said I don?t want to leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby just gives me one reason
Give me just one reason why
Baby just give me one reason
Give me just one reason why I should stay
said I told you that I loved you and there ain't no more to say"
Come On Over,33,Shania Twain,"Get a life-get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break-take control
Take advice from someone you know

Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind

Make a wish-make a move
Make up your mind-you can choose
When you're up-when you're down
When you need a laugh come around

Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind

Oh, oh, oh...

Be a winner-be a star
Be happy to be who you are
Gotta be yourself-gotta make a plan
Gotta go for it while you can

Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind

Get a life-get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break-take control
Take advice from someone you know

Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind

Amazing Grace,103,Judy Collins,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
놀라운 은총,너무나 달콤한 주님의 음성
That saved a wretch like me
나와같이 비참한사람들을 구해주시니
I once was lost but now I'm found,
한때 길을 잃었었지만 지금은 나의 길을 찾았어요
Was blind but now I see.

Tin Pan Alley,124,Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble,"Went down to Tin Pan Alley
See what was going on
Things was too hot down there
Couldn't stay very long


Hey, Alley's the roughest place
I've ever been
All the people down there
Living for their whisky, wine, and gin

I heard a woman scream
Yeah and I peeped through the door
Some cat was working on Annie with a
Lord with a two-by-four



I heard a pistol shoot
Yeah and it was a 44
Somebody killed a crap shooter
Cause he didn't shake, rattle, and roll



I saw a cop standing
With his hand on his gun
He said ""this is a raid, boy now
No, nobody run""

Hey, Alley's the roughest place
I've ever been
Yeah they took me away from Alley
Lord they took me right back to the pen"
Blowing In The Wind,45,"Peter, Paul & Mary","How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she can sleep in the sand?

How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind.

How many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?

How many times can a man turn his head
and pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind.

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many years must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?

How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind"
Parisienne Walkways-'93,339,Gary Moore,"I remember Paris in '49
The Champs Elysee
San Michelle and old Beaujolais wine
I recall that you were mine
in those Parisienne days

Looking back at the photographs
Those summer days spent
outside corner cafes
Oh I could write you paragraphs
about my old Parisienne days"
"Poems, Prayers and Promises",91,John Denver,"I've been lately thinking
about my life's time
All the things I've done
and how it's been
And I can't help believin'
in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end
I've seen a lot of sunshine
slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures
had myself some friends
Spent a time or two in my own home
I have to say it now
it's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have
a chance to hang around
Lie there by the fire and
watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my
old lady sit and pass a pipe around
And talk of poems and
prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow and
what about our dreams
And all the memories we share
Days they pass so quickly now
the nights are seldom long
Time around me whispers
when it's cold
The changes somehow
frightens me still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old
Although my life's been good to me
there's still so much to do
So many things my mind
has never known
I'd like to raise a family
I'd like to sail away
And dance across
the mountains on the moon
I have to say it now it's been
a good life all in all
It's really fine to have a chance
to hang around
Lie there by the fire and
watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
sit and pass a pipe around
And talk of poems and
prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow and
what about our dreams
And all the memories we share"
Malted Milk,43,Eric Clapton,"I keep drinking malted milk
trying to drive my blues away

I keep drinking malted milk
trying to drive my blues away
Baby you're just as
welcome to my loving
as the flowers is in May
Malted milk malted milk
keep rushing to my head

Malted milk malted milk
keep rushing to my head

And I have a funny funny feeling
and I'm talking all out my head
Baby fix me one more drink
and hug your daddy one more time

Baby fix me one more drink
and hug your daddy one more time
Keep on stirring
my malted milk mama
until I change my mind

My doorknob keeps on turning
there must be spooks around my bed

My doorknob keeps on turning
there must be spooks around my bed

And I have a funny funny feeling
and the hair's rising on my head"
I Can't Stop Loving You,4,Freddy Fender,"I can't stop loving you
I say I done made up my mind
To live in a memory
Of lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So, I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy, happy hours
That we once knew
So long ago
Still makes me blue
They say that time
Time heals a broken heart
But mine stood still
Since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you
I say I done made up my mind
To live in a memory
Of lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
I was afraid the table going to break down or something
So, I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Hey, ah-whoa!"

Homeward Bound,22,Simon & Garfunkel,"I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket to my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Silently for me."
Bookends,101,Simon & Garfunkel,"Time it was, and what a time it was, it was

Streets Of London,18,Ralph McTell,"Have you seen the old man
In the closed down market
Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes
In his eyes you see no pride
Hands held loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper, telling yesterday's news
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

In the old night cafe at a quarter past eleven
The same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me that you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man
Outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the minor ribands that he wears
In our city winter the rain cries little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world which doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of"
Mr. Tambourine Man,92,Bob Dylan,"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly
across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving
free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you."
Scarborough Fair/ Canticle,7,Simon & Garfunkel,"Are you going to
Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Remember me
to one who lives there
She once was
a true love of mine

Tell her to make me
a cambric shirt
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Without no seams
nor needless work
Then she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell her to find me
an acre of land
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Between the salt water
and the sea strand
Then she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
And gather it all
in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be
a true love of mine
Are you going to
Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage rosemary
and thyme
Remember me
to one who lives there
She once was
a true love of mine"
The Little Red Rooster,8,Willie Dixon,"I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way

Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Watch out stray cat,
The little red rooster's on the prowl

If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
Been no peace in the barnyard
Since that little red rooster's been gone

I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way

Joey,2,Tammy Wynette,"Outside the sun is shining, it's such a pretty day
I'm waitin' in the shadows watchin' you and Joey play
Right now I feel like dyin' 'cause I heard Joey say
""All the other kids I know have daddies everyday""

""Oh Daddy, please ask Mommy, could you come home to stay?
Me and Mommy need you, I love you anyway
All the other kids I know have daddies everyday""

Honey, I've been thinkin', our little Joey's bright
He doesn't understand our little childish grownup fights
You're just his Sunday Daddy, could you come home to stay?
'Cause all the other kids he knows have daddies everyday

""Oh Daddy, please ask Mommy, could you come home to stay?
Me and Mommy need you, I love you anyway
All the other kids I know have daddies everyday"""
If I Ever Fall In Love Again,15,Kenny Rogers,"You, I know you're everything
That I've been looking for
And I, I look into your eyes
And could not ask for more
So it's only fair to lay it on the line
Hold on, I'm gonna need a little time

But if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken heart can mend
I know it's gonna be with you
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again

Scared, I guess I'm scared to fly
It's such a long way down
And yet, if you'd just trust in me
I'm sure, I'd come around
And I know when you're hurt
It's hard to let someone inside
In your arms I feel I'm ready now to try

So if I ever ...

I'd be a fool to ever let you go
You're the best thing in my life
When I know I've gotta take it slow

I know ..."
Wake Up Little Susie,21,Simon & Garfunkel,"Wake up, little Susie, wake up

The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well

Whatta we gonna tell your mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say 창??ooh-la-la창??

We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot

Boxer,37,Simon & Garfunkel,"I am just a poor boy
나는 가난한 사내
Though my story's seldom told
사람들은 내 이야기를 잘 모르겠지만
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
주머니 한 가득 채워 줄 거란 말
있는 힘을 다해 주먹을 날렸었지
Such are promises
그런 약속을 믿었어
All lies, and jests
모두 거짓과 허풍일 뿐이련안
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
인간은 원하는 말만 들으려고 하고
And disregards the rest
다른 것에 대해선 고개 돌려버리지

When I left my home and my family
내가 집과 가족을 떠났을때
I was no more than a boy
나는 그저 소년에 불과했었어
In the company of strangers
낯선 군중들
In the quiet of the railway station
기차역의 적막 속에서
Running scared
겁에 질려 달음질치며
Llaying low
보일 듯 말 듯 웅크린 채
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
누더기를 걸친 이들이 살아가는
빈민가를 찾아 헤매다
Looking for the places only they would know
오직 그들만이 알고 있는 그런 곳을 전전했었지

Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la--la-lie
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la-la-la-lie

Asking only workman's wages
막노동의 대가 정도만 바라며
I come looking for a job
일자리를 찾아 다녔지만
But I get no offers
아무도 일을 안 주더군
Just a ""come on"" from the whores
on seventh Avenue
7번가 창녀들의 유혹의 말 외에는
I do declare there were times
그래, 난 말할 수 있어
When I was so lonesome
너무나 외로웠을 땐
I took some comfort there
나도 그런 곳에서 평안을 구했어

Ooo-la-la
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la--la-lie
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la-la-la-lie

Then I'm laying out my winterclothes
그러다간 겨울 옷가지를 늘어놓고
And wishing I was gone, going home
떠나고 싶어하는 거야, 집으로 가고 있다면
Where the New York City
winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home
뉴욕의 매서운 겨울바람에도 살갗 터지지 않는
눈물 흘리지 않는 그 곳, 집으로

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
텅 빈 벌판 위
싸움으로 돈을 버는 한 권투 선수가 서 있다
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
그 얼굴의 상처들은, 자신을 무너뜨리고
고통으로 비명 지를 때까지 찍어 내리던
그 모든 주먹의 기억을 싣고 있지
In his anger and his shame
분노와 치욕 속에서 되뇌이는 건
I am leaving, I am leaving
떠나야지, 떠나야지
But the fighter still remains
하지만, 선수는 아직 떠나지 못해요

Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la--la-lie

Bye Bye Happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry

Bye Bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness

She sure looks happy
I sure am blue

That might have been

사랑이여 잘 가
달콤한 손길과도 헤어져야 하는구나

내 사랑이여 안녕
내 사랑이여 안녕

내 애인이 낯선 사람과
함께 가고 있어
확실히 그녀는 행복해 보여
나는 이렇게 우울한데
그 사람이 우리사이에 끼어들기 전까지는
그녀는 나의 연인이었는데
연애가 아니었을지도 모르지만
연애여 안녕

나는 연애로 부터 해방되었어
사랑도 끝장이 나버렸어
하늘의 별을 세어 보는 일도
이제는 끝이야
내가 자유로와진 이유는
여기에 있지
그것은 내 사랑하는 연인과
헤어졌다는 것이야

Song For The Asking,27,Simon & Garfunkel,"this is my song for the asking
ask me and i will play
so sweetly i´ll make you smile

this is my dream for the taking
take it, don´t turn away
all the love that i feel inside

thinking it over i´d be sad,
thinking it over i´m more than glad to change my ways
for the asking
ask me and i will play
i´ve been waiting here all my life."
Hazey Jane II,25,Nick Drake,"And what will happen in the morning when the world it gets
so crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.

And what will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel
with the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
and so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
in the morning.

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eyeshade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

Let's sing a song
For Hazey Jane
She's back again in my mind.
If songs were lines
In a conversation
The situation would be fine."
Help Me,64,Joni Mitchell,"Help me
I think I'm falling
In love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know
I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble
'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet-taIking-ladies man
And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future
And worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good
We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking
Didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady
With the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around
Flirting and flirting
Hurting too
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom"
Kodachrome*,122,Paul Simon,"When I think back
On all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder I can think at all
And though my lack of education
Hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall

Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

If you took all the girls I knew
When I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match
my sweet imagination
Everything looks worse in black and white

They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away"
Slip Slidin' Away,29,Paul Simon,"Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Delores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away"
Blowin' In The Wind,91,"Peter, Paul & Mary","How many roads
must a man walk down
before you call
him a man?

How many times

fly before
they're forever banned?
The answer my friend
is blowing in the wind
The answer
is blowing in the wind~

How many years
can a mountain exist
before it's washed
to the sea?
How many years
can some people exist
before they're allowed
to be free?
How many times

his head pretending
he just doesn't see?

How many times

That too many people
have died?

Leaving On A Jet Plane,81,"Peter, Paul & Mary","All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go

Already I'm so lonesome I could cry.

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go.

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I think of you
Every song I sing, I sing for you
When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring.

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go.

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say,

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go.

Oh, babe, I hate to go."

And this time it's me
And I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters

That you'll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart
Must take its turn at misery

And this time it's me
And I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone"
Gone,177,Jack Johnson,"Well look at all those fancy clothes
But these could keep us warm
Just like those.
And what about your soul
Is it cold
Is it straight from the mold
And ready to be sold.
And cars and phones and diamond rings
Bling, bling
Those are only removable things
And what about your mind
Does it shine
Or are there things that concern you more
Than your time
Gone going
Gone everything
Gone give a damn
Gone be the birds when they dont want to sing
Gone people
All awkward with their things
Gone
Well look at you out to make a deal
You try to be appealing but you lose youre appeal
And what about those shoes youre in today
Theyll do no good
All the bridges you burnt a long the way
Youre willing to sell anything
Gone with your herd
Leave your footprints
And well shame them with our words
Gone people
All careless and consumed
Gone
Gone going
Gone everything
Gone give a damn
Gone be the birds when they dont want to sing
Gone people
All awkward with their things
Gone"
Crossroads,17,Don McLean,"I've got nothing on my mind: Nothing to remember,
Nothing to forget. And I've got nothing to regret,
But I'm all tied up on the inside,
No one knows quite what I've got;
And I know that on the outside
What I used to be, I'm not anymore.

You know I've heard about people like me,
But I never made the connection.
They walk one road to set them free
And find they've gone the wrong direction.

But there's no need for turning back
`Cause all roads lead to where I stand.
And I believe I'll walk them all
No matter what I may have planned.

Can you remember who I was? Can you still feel it?
Can you find my pain? Can you heal it?
Then lay your hands upon me now
And cast this darkness from my soul.
You alone can light my way.
You alone can make me whole once again.

We've walked both sides of every street
Through all kinds of windy weather.
But that was never our defeat
As long as we could walk together.

So there's no need for turning back
`Cause all roads lead to where we stand.
And I believe we'll walk them all
No matter what we may have planned."
Castles In The Air,31,Don McLean,"And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of Castles in the Air
I've got a dream I want the world to share in castle walls
Just leave me to despair
Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky
A dream come true, I"
Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Old Oak Tree,12,Tony Orlando & Dawn,"I'm coming home

If you received my letter
telling you I'd soon be free
Then you'll know
just what to do if you still want me
If you still want me
Oh tie a yellow ribbon round

It's been three long years
Do you still want me Still want me

Cause I couldn't bear to see
what I might see
I'm really still in prison

A simple yellow ribbon's

Do you still want me Still want me
If I don't see a ribbon round

And I can't believe I see

Somebody Like You,198,Keith Urban,"There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known.

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,
Shinin' down on me and you.
When you put your arms around me,
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do.

I'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back.
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, mmm, mmm.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

Whoa here we go now!

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,
Shinin' down on me and you.
When you put your arms around me,
Well, baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do.

Sometimes it's hard for me to understand,
But you're teachin' me to be a better man.
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

I'm ready to love somebody,
Love somebody like you. Oooh.

An' I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you, yeah.

Oh yeah.
Oh, I wanna be the man in the middle of the night,

I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah..."

A Hazy Shade of Winter,35,Simon & Garfunkel,"Time,
Time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities.

I was so hard to please.
Look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.

Hear the Salvation Army band.
Down by the riverside's
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned.

Carry your cup in your hand.
And look around.
Leaves are brown.
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.

Hang on to your hopes, my friend.
That's an easy thing to say,
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again.
Look around,
The grass is high,
The fields are ripe,
It's the springtime of my life.

Seasons change with the scenery;
Weaving time in a tapestry.
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
Looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme.

Drinking my vodka and lime,
I look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter."
Stardust,31,Willie Nelson,"Sometimes I wounder
Why I spend the lonely night
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my memory
And I am once again you
When our love is new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in star dust of sun
Beside the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tales
Of paradise where roses grow
Though I dream them in my heart
They always will remain
My stardust memory
The memory of loves refrain
And though I dream in vain
In my heart it will always will remain
My stardust memory
The memory of loves refrain"
Before The Next Teardrop Falls (Feat. David Hidalgo),26,Dolly Parton,"If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you


And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls

Alli estare candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls

I'll be there, I'll be there

There goes my act of playin it cool

Well I think you're playin with me darlin

Chattahoochee,12,Alan Jackson,"Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Yeah, that's right."

Would You Go With Me,12,Josh Turner,"Would you go with me
if we rolled down streets of fire
Would you ohold on to me tighter
as the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down

Would you go with me
if we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer
until the trip was over
and would it be okay if i didn't know th way

If i gave you my hand would you take it
and make me the happiest man in the world
If i told you my heart couldn't beat
one more minute without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so, so would you go with me

Would you go with me
if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free would you go with me

If i gave you my hand would you take it
and make me the happiest man in the world
If i told you my heart couldn't beat
one more minute without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me"

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler
the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut 'em down
Well my goodness gracious
let me tell you the news
My head's been wet
with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee
talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice
so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle
of the angel's feet
He called my name
and my heart stood still
When he said
John go do My will
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler
the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut 'em down

Well you may throw your rock
and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark
against your fellow man
But as sure as
God made black and white
What's down in the dark will be
brought to the light
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up

I slip in bed when you're asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up


As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you want to be loved

Cause I'm never, never giving you up

Coconut Skins,275,Damien Rice,"You can hold her hand

Explain to her your weakness

Before you crumble up inside
Spend your time asking everyone else's permission
Then run away and hide

Or you can sit on chimneys
Put some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're doing or waiting for
But if anyone should ask
Tell them I've been licking coconut skins
And we've been hanging out
Tell them God just dropped by to forgive our sins
And relieve us our doubt

Oh you can hold her eggs
But your basket has a hole
You can lie between her legs and go looking for
Tell her you're searching for her soul
You can wait for ages
Watch your compost turn to coal
Time is contagious
Everybody's getting old

So you can sit on chimneys
Put some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're doing or looking for

And we've been hanging out
Tell them God just dropped by to forgive our sins

"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her",22,Simon & Garfunkel,"what a dream I had
Pressed in Organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smocky burgundy
Softer than the rain

I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks fleshed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh,I live you girl
Oh,I love you"

Upward Over The Mountain,109,iron & wine,"Mother don't worry, I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother don't worry, I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Mother remember being so stern with that girl who was with me
Mother remember the blink of an eye when I breathed through your body

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying upwards over the mountain

Mother I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prison
Mother I lost it all of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother forget me now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother forgive me I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons can be birds taken broken up to the mountain

Mother don't worry I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother don't worry she's got a garden we're it planting together
Mother remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry
Blood on the floor and the fleas in their paws
And you cried 'til the morning

So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying always over the mountain"
If You Were Coming In The Fall,52,Carla Bruni,"if you were coming in the fall,
i`d brush the summer by
with half a smile and half a spum,
as housewives do a fly.

if i could see you in a year,
i`d wind the months in balls,
and put them each in separate
drawers,
until their time befalls.

if only centuries delayed,
i`d count them on my hand,
subtracting till my fingers dropped
into Van Diemen`s Iand.

if certain, when this life was out,
that yours and mine should be,
i`d toss it yonder like a rind,
and taste eternity.

but now, all ignorant of the length
of time`s uncertain wing,
it goads me, like the goblin bee,
that will not state its sting."

from the ground i see who you are

I'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me
then you cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover
when you're around
and here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said
last night and i know that you
see what you're doing to me
tell me why

You could write a book on
how to ruin someone's perfect day
well i get so confused
and frustrated
forget what i'm trying to say
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me
then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover
when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said
last night and i know that you
see what you're doing to me
tell me why
why do you have to make me feel
small so you can feel whole inside
why do you have to
put down my dreams so you're
the only thing on my mind
i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me
then cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i've got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love
then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said
last night and i know that you
see what you're doing to me
tell me why why tell me why
i take a step back let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you know"
Worn Me Down,155,Rachael Yamagata,"Gone she`s gone
How do you feel about it?
That`s what I thought
You`re real torn up about it
And I wish you the best
But I could do without it
And I will because you`ve worn me down
Oh, I will because you`ve worn me down

Worn me down like a road
I did everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did everything to please you
But you can’t stop thinking about her
No, you can’t stop thinking about her

And you`re wrong. You`re wrong
I`m not overreacting
Something is off
Why don`t we ever believe ourselves?
And I, oh I, I feel that word for you
And I will because you’ve worn me down
And I will because you have worn me down

Worn me down like a road
I did everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did everything to please
But you can`t stop thinking about her
No, you can`t stop thinking about her

She`s so pretty
She`s so damn right
But I`m so tired of thinking
about her, again, tonight

Worn me down like a road
I did everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did everything to please you

Worn me down like a road
I did everything you told me to do
But you, you can’t stop thinking about her
No, you can`t stop thinking about her
No, you can`t stop thinking about her
No, you can`t stop thinking of her -"
Kantoi (Album Version),85,Zee Avi,"Semalam I call you, you tak answer,
You kata you keluar pergi dinner
You kata you keluar dengan kawan you
But when I called Tommy he said it wasn't true

So I drove my car pergi Damansara
Tommy kata maybe you tengok bola
Tapi bila I sampai, you, you tak ada?
Lagi lah jadi gila

So I called and called sampai you answer
You kata ""Sorry sayang tadi tak dengar""
""My phone was on silent, I was at the gym""
Tapi latar belakang suara perempuan lain

Sudahlah sayang, I, don't believe you,
I've always known that your words were never true
Why am I with you, I pun tak tau!
No wonder lah my friends pun tak suka you

So I guess that's the end of our story,
Akhir kata, she accepted his apology
Tapi last last kita dapat tau
She was cheating too

With her exboyfriend's best friend,
Tommy

Wake Me Up,"1,549",Son Of Caesar,"Yesterday's a haze
I'm drunk and I've been
drinking for days
Slurring all the time
Pouring poison wine
down my spine
Bottles in the hall
Breaking in the fall
From a paper bag
Everything's a mess
I'm tired and depressed
And every single day
is a drag
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says stop
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says
never mind
Wrinkles in my face
I'm older now in
so many ways
In and out of style
Worried and confused
like a child
Shoot me into space
Or take me to the place
I was born into
Heaven has sign
It says Access is denied
When you act like you
Shoot me into space
Or take me to the place
I was born into
Heaven has sign
It says Access is denied
When you act like you
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says stop
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says never mind"

This Is How We Roll (Feat. Luke Bryan),369,Florida Georgia Line,"The mixtape's got
a little Hank little Drake
A little something bumping thump
thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our
drink's a little stronger
than you think
So get a grip

The truck's jacked up
flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out
everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down

at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town

If you roll with me yeah

This life I live

but it's for me though
Let's roll
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out

We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly
I just turn and look at you baby
This is how we roll
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and
we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out

We light it up with our hands up

What You Do To Me,239,Dan + Shay,"I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
I said Girl, you're beautiful, 'n' you already know it
But I'll say it again and a million times after that
You laugh and you shake your head and say Boy, you're crazy
Well, girl, if I'm crazy, I'm only crazy 'bout you
I was lookin' right into your eyes, right then, porch light
Flipped on and I saw your dad lookin' through the window
Hope he ain't mad
Then I helped you outta my truck,through the yard to your front door
Said Girl, am I gonna see you again You answered me back with a kiss
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say I love you out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said She's the one
Said Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name
Like a merry go round, got my head spinnin' round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
I picked you up for our second date, you're sure lookin' pretty
Sweet as an angel, here to save my soul
Mmm, yea, you get me high, you take me to heaven
And I get to shakin' when you put your lips on mine
It could be the best night of my life, least 'til next time
Oh yea, gotta get this right, follow all the rules and be back by 9
Pulled up to drop you off, leanin' in to sneak one more
Said Baby, when can I see you again How 'bout every night after this
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say I love you out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said She's the one
Said Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name
Like a merry go round, got my head spinnin' round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do, do, do, do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out

Windows,199,Lewis Watson,"I'm not here to startle you
Hell, I only came
'cause you asked me to
It's such a shame
that we can't renew
All those feelings
that we shared back
a month or two
You know, I kept everything
that reminds me of us
It sounds weird
but your picture's still hung up
I've tried getting distracted
by other stuff
But that's not enough
I'm sleeping with a pillow,
under lamplight
Freezing cold,
'cause you always
liked the windows
Opened wide
Just so you know, I'll be here
when you make it home
I'll call you up at like 3am,
again
Just to make sure you know
that I don't mind waiting
Although the call will end
with us both saying
That we both hate this
I'm not sleeping too well,
now I'm sleeping alone
And all you have
to do is pick up the phone
And I'll come running
to your aid
but I'm sure you know
This won't help us grow
I'm still sleeping
with a pillow, under lamplight
Freezing cold,
'cause you always
liked the windows opened wide
Just so you know,
I'll be here
when you make it home
I'm sleeping with a pillow,
under lamplight
Freezing cold,
'cause you always
liked the windows
Opened wide

If I Could Hold On to Love,5,Kenny Rogers,"Just once in my life
If I could find someone, if once
The feeling was right
I'd never let her go

I'd always be there
If I could have my chance to be
The only one
It just isn't fair

If I could hold on to love
I'd never let it go
I'd keep it right next to my heart

If I could hold her tonight
She'd never leave my side
If I could only hold on to love

I'm searching my dreams
I'm trying to recognize that face
Oh, who can it be?
She's calling out to me and now I'm

Running to her
But every time I get this close
She vanishes
Into the night

If I could hold on to love
I'd never let it go
I'd keep it right next to my heart

If I could hold her tonight
She'd never leave my side
If I could only hold on to love

Is it ever come to pass
That I find a love that lasts
Or is that too much to ask?

If I could hold her tonight
She'd never leave my side
If I could only hold on to love
If I could only hold on to love"

Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and daddy put their roots right here
'Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust
Pickin' us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A C in the vents
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin' up in little pink houses
Makin' out on living room couches
Blowin' that smoke on Saturday night
A little messed up, but we're all alright
Baptist church parkin' lot, tryin' not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin' it to second base, but sayin' you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
Now he's sittin' out back, 3030 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA

"Jesus, Take The Wheel",109,Carrie Underwood,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, wow, ohhhhh"
Leave The Night On,869,Sam Hunt,"They roll the sidewalks in this town
All up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here
When midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain
I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
Now all the stars are turnin' blue
Just kissed the clock 222
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold
Nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
This DJ's on a roll
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight"
Make It Holy,30,The Staves,"I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy, make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy, make it fine
High ends in the fire moving on, moving on
Torn apart and tired of it all, of it all
Walk, never the same
Feel no glory, feel no pain
I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy, make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy, make you fine
Shaking out the sheets and holding on, holding on
Following my feet until it's done, until it's gone
It's dead and gone
Never the same
Feel no glory, feel no pain
I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy, make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy, make it fine
It's the one I want now
You'll never do wrong
You'll never do wrong
Did I ever, ever
Ever do you wrong
I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy, make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy, make it fine"
Late To The Party,506,Kacey Musgraves,"They're blowing up our phones, asking where we are
Just say we're almost there we ain't even in the car
You're rolling one for two and I'm still picking out my shoes
I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged
We're gonna look real good, but we're gonna look real rude
I'm sorry I'm not sorry that I'm
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
Let's promise when we get in that we'll try to get right out
Fake a couple conversations, make the necessary rounds
These kinda things just turn into who's leaving here with who
But I just want 'em all to see me come in
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

I Do (Cherish You),31,Mark Wills,"All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world, all that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel,all my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I,

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
you don't have to think twice
I will, love you still
From the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

In my world, before you
I lived outside my emotions, didn't know where I was going
'til that day, I found you
how you opened my life to a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart until my dying day

[repeat chorus]

If you're asking do I love you this much
I do, oh, I do"

Someone For Everyone,209,Jamie Lawson,"All my friends and lovers, there's something I'd like to say
If you feel you've lost a little faith along the way
If you ever wondered how you came to be here
I need to tell you that you've got nothing to fear
Cause there are reasons for the way that this world works
There are reasons I know, sometimes it still hurts
Don't worry, don't worry, if you can't find love in a hurry
Don't fret, don't fret, know love hasn't given up yet
It's hard worn, hard worn, and love doesn't care what you've done
There's someone here for everyone
Now all my sisters, brothers, all of my mothers sons
And all my childhood lovers, and others that I've run from
Cause there are reasons for the way that this world spins
There are reasons, and if you can't find your way in
Don't worry, don't worry, if you can't find love in a hurry
Don't fret, don't fret, know love hasn't given up yet
It's hard worn, hard worn, and love doesn't care what you've done
There's someone here for everyone
And if you're still waiting for that chance to come your way
Hold on, hold on, hold Ooonnnn
Everyone
Everyone
Cause there are reasons for the way that this world works
There are reasons I know, sometimes it still hurts
Don't worry, don't worry, if you can't find love in a hurry
Don't fret, don't fret, know love hasn't given up yet
It's hard worn, hard worn, and love doesn't care what you've done
There's someone here for everyone
There's someone here for everyone"
Drown,448,Seafret,"What doesn't kill you
makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul
growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
one more moment of this silence
The loneliness is killing me
And the weight of the world's
getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay
and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake
and bring me home again
Who will fix me now
Dive in when I'm down
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
Who will make me fight
Drag me out alive
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
What doesn't destroy you
leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul
growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
one more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's
getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay
and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake
and bring me home again
Who will fix me now
Dive in when I'm down
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
Who will make me fight
Drag me out alive
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
Who will fix me now
Who will fix me now
Who will fix me now

Save me from myself

Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get

you know you ain't getting younger
Your pain and your hunger are driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
Sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be raining
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
Let somebody love you
Before it's too late"
Let It Go,139,Joshua Hyslop,"Well I've loved, I've lost
But I still can't find
The way to the middle of my heart
And I open my eyes and I don't know why
But I feel so old
You don't know what you've got but you've got to let it go

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, I know
You don't know what you've got but you've got to let it go

Well the sun will set on my sins tonight
But the weight's been lifted off my heart
And is it all that much just for me to ask that the truth be told
You don't know what you've got but you've got to let it go

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, I know
You don't know what you've got but you've got to let it go
You don't know what you've got but you've got to let it go

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, I know
You don't know what you've got but you've got to let it go
You don't know what you've got but you've got to let it go"

How Much You Mean To Me,259,Alvin Ordonez,"It’s sometimes crazy
when you wait away
Like there’s no hope
and nothing matters today
The city’s burning
I must find a way to live
‘Til I can learn to forgive
But I don’t know
I don’t know I don’t know
I don’t know if I can dig so deep
Anticipating the next time
we will meet
I fear to find just
what tomorrow will bring
But I pray it’s a better
version of yesterday
And oh I miss those times
We would fall asleep while
we were still on the line
All those times
when we would talk about
How happy we would be
I still wish it were you and me
Because you got me twisted oh girl
I’m down on my knees
I’m beggin you
Oh I’m beggin you please
Will you stand by me
And I will whisper softly
how much you mean to me
how much you mean to me girl
Her laugh her smile
are the things that light up my day
Memories of her
in my head still not fading away
Wish she’d stay say okay
please don’t go away
Please don’t go away because
I find myself smiling every time
I think of you
There’s risks I have to take
I said this is our fate
This time let’s make things
go our way
And oh I miss those times
We would fall asleep while
we were still on the line
All those times
when we would talk about
How happy we would be
I still wish it were you and me
Because you got me twisted oh girl
I’m down on my knees
I’m beggin you
Oh I’m beggin you please
Will you stand by me
And I will whisper softly
how much you mean to me
You and me
You amaze me
Me without you
oh baby that’s crazy
Won’t you come over
and save me
And oh I miss those times
We would fall asleep
while we were still on the line
All those times
when we would talk about
How happy we would be
I still wish it were you and me
Because you got me twisted oh girl
I’m down on my knees
I’m beggin you
Oh I’m beggin you please
Will you stand by me
And I will whisper softly
how much you mean to me
how much you mean to me girl"
Cleopatra,324,The Lumineers,"I was Cleopatra
I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress
and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it
as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket
I had no plans
And I left the footprints
the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did
when you left town
But I must admit it
that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife
I'd be your mistress
just to have you around
But I was late for this late for that
late for the love of my life
And when I die alone when I die alone
when I die I'll be on time
While the church discouraged
any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh it was my currency
but I held true
So I drive a taxi
and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat
they remind me of you
But I was late for this
late for that
late for the love of my life
And when I die alone
when I die alone
when I die I'll be on time
And the only gifts from my Lord
were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script
and the costume fits
so I'll play my part
I was Cleopatra
I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now
gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes
leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end
I won't be late for this late for that
late for the love of my life
And when I die alone when I die alone
when I die I'll be on time"

How Not To,495,Dan + Shay,"I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to

You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret

But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you

Middle Names,504,Devendra Banhart,"I pretend
when I look in your eyes
Don't know where you're going
Don't come back
please come back tonight
Just about the only thing
left is a lie
I wonder where you are
Then I wonder
But I won't wonder anymore
And I can see you now
Sitting there in front
of the station
Feel the rain fall down again
I'd love to be there now
but I'm heading
in the other direction
Feel the rain fall
Feel the rain fall
Why is the moon so bright
Why are you so nice
See you alone
at the Walgreens at night
I used to think
that you'd always return
to your woman in waiting
My love belongs to no one
And just about the only thing
left is a lie
I wonder where you are
Then I wonder again
And I can see you now
Sitting there in front
of the station
Feel the rain fall down again"
"God, Your Mama, And Me (Feat. Backstreet Boys)",143,Florida Georgia Line,"That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me

Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me

You better believe it, you better believe it
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'm part of you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me

Midnight,138,Liz Lawrence,"It’s been raining all summer
All summer
We’re stuck inside
with a million regrets
Lit by the blue light from your TV set
And I’m walking
And I’m walking home
as the day breaks
Mulling over my mistakes
Head full cocaine
I’m sure as hell ain’t tired yet
I want to change the world
But I ain’t getting out of bed
I gotta step outside but last night
Is ringing in my ears
And running rings around me dear
Get a 9 to 5 and save for a rainy day
But I was stuck inside
When the summer came
And there was happiness
Shining through the window pane
There’s warnings in the street
That the kids ain’t doing alright
Riots in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
It’s in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
Riots in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
It’s in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
Riots in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
It’s in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
Ah ain’t doing alright
Ah ain’t doing alright
Ah ain’t doing alright
Ah ain’t doing alright
Riots in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
It’s in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
Riots in the street
and the kids ain’t doing alright
It’s in the street

I'd Rather Be Sorry,1,Kris Kristofferson,"If you hurt me, you won't be the first or the last
In a lifetime of many mistakes.
But I won't spend tomorrow regretting the past
For the chances that I didn't take.

'Cause I'll never know 'til it's over
If I'm right or I'm wrong loving you,
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done
Than for something that I didn't do.

When you touch me it's easy to make me believe
Tomorrow won't take you away
But I'd gamble whatever tomorrow might bring
For the love that I'm living today.

And I'll never know 'til it's over
If I'm right or I'm wrong loving you,
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done
Than for something that I didn't do.

Yes I'd rather be sorry for something I've done
Than for something that I didn't do."

On a different drink

A World Next Door to Yours,93,Jawn,"Have you ever felt
The corners of your body
Curl up like paper in a fire?
And the bridges that
you never meant to burn
Leave you with nowhere else to hide
You've found you're feeling lost
There's no comfort in the cross
When you're ticked off
With everything around you
Everything around you
And the years are passing
through my fingers
But nothing ever changes
Yeah this world moves fast
but I still linger
Caught in between
You've found you're feeling old,
Lost the laughter in your soul,
And you're ticked off
With everything around you
Everything around you
There are days that I wish I could stand
In someone else's shoes
There are days that I wish
that I could color
In someone else's hues
But there's no use in thinking that;
You are you, and there's a fact
And this world would be a little less
Without you here
So open up those doors
And run into
A world next door to yours"

Forever After All,65,Luke Combs,"Verse 1
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

Pre-Chorus
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

Chorus
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

Verse 2
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

Pre-Chorus
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

Chorus
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

Guitar Solo

Chorus
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

After all"

There's always room for you
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over the same old story now
Is it so much to ask
You to lay in the bed for a moment
Say it isn't a dream
Why can't you stay here with me
Darling when you go
Does he know where you come
And how you let me hold you on
The dark sidе of the sun
Does he smеll my cologne
Mixed with your perfume
And does he know
you're late for work
Whenever I'm with you
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over the same old story now
Is it so much to ask
You to lay in the bed for a moment

Why can't you stay here with me

I Found Home,30,Raechel Whitchurch,"Some people have their bucket list
Some people just have dreams
I'm no exception to the rule it seems
I've watched the sunset at Uluru
Felt the lights on the big big stage
Walked by myself through Hollywood
And I've seen a soul get saved

There is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
First thing that I saw, when I came walking through that door
Once I was alone, but when I found you I found home

I've met some of my heroes
and I've got a few real good friends
I'm getting better at being okay with not knowing how this story ends
I've brought life into this world
and I have watched life go
I always say just what I need to say
So baby just in case you don't know

There is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
First thing that I saw, when I came walking through that door
Once I was alone, but when I found you I found home

There is so much left to do, but it means nothing without you
I just want you always by my side
There is nothing I could see that would make me more happy
than coming home, all alone, remembering you're mine

There is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
First thing that I saw, when I came walking through that door
There is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
Nothing else will do, cause it means nothing without you
Once I was alone, but when I found you I found home

They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face

But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth
Five years from now she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone

She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Skater boy rocking MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they all got tickets to see his show

She tags along, stands in a crowd
Looks at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy
She said, “See you later, boy”

He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth

He wasn't good enough for her
He wasn't good enough for her
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck that she's mine now

'Cause we're more than just good friends
And this is how the story ends
I'm just a boy, she's just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious

We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

She's with the skater boy
Said, “See you later boy”
She's with the skater boy
Said, “See you later boy”"

I was always searching for something to worsen that
Lying for affection, all for you to show you care

Well, I guess you drew me a kinda crazy

Tell me what you're waiting for
'Cause I was always waiting for you
There's some things I can't ignore

It wasn't your intention, I can see it under you
Invite me to your house where you know what we're gonna do

When did life get so complicated

I Went to Your Wedding,1,Patti Page,"I went to your wedding
Although I was dreading
The thought of losing you

The organ was playing
My poor heart kept saying
Your dreams, your dreams are through

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Then whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Oh, your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you"
star-crossed,63,Kacey Musgraves,"Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Let me set the scene
Two lovers ripped right at the seams
They woke up from the perfect dream
And then the darkness came
I signed the papers yesterday
You came and took your things away
I moved out of the home we made
And gave you back your name
What have we done
Did we fly too high
just to get burned by the sun
No one's to blame
'Cause we called
all the angels to save us
Called them by name
But I guess they got lost

Or the face in your locket

I'd be your silver lining
Not a cloud full of rain
And the music would rise up
When I said your name

[Chorus]
If this was a movie I'd be surprised
Hearing your car coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
If this was a movie

[Verse 2]
If this was a movie
Love would be enough
To save us from the darkness that's inside both of us
And we'd get away and we'd be okay

And you'd run up the stairs

I try to learn from my mistakes but I ain't there yet
You never know when it's the last second chance you'll get
Should've have paid more attention all the times you said

Any day now I'm gonna pack this truck up
You left my heart out in the rain to rust
Told me all the things that you had enough of
And I swore I was gonna change
Any day now I'll make up for the heartache
Any day now but you couldn't wait
Judging by the screen door slam two taillights fading outta town
Guess it's any day now

The thing about time is it goes too fast
And the thing about love, it don't always last
And I can't right the wrong when you already left
Going over and over all the times I said

Any day now I'm gonna pack this truck up
You left my heart out in the rain to rust
Told you all the things that I had enough of
And you swore you were gonna change
Any day now I'll make up for the heartache
Any day now but I couldn't wait
Judging by the screen door slam two taillights fading outta town
Guess it's any day now

It's any day now

'Cause I wasn't done loving you
Now there's nothing here left to prove
Have mercy on the man that didn't know then
You were all I had to lose
No I wasn't done loving you
So many things I meant to do
I'm cold as the pillow by your empty nightstand
You're long gone now with my heart in your hand

Any day now I'll make up for the heartache
Any day now but you couldn't wait
Judging by the screen door slam two taillights fading outta town
Guess it's any day now
It's too little, too late for any day now
It's any day now"

Cry,24,Adam Melchor,"Verse 1
I'm not always strong but I got good posture
I stand up tall and push my shoulders back
Maybe we're all just good impostors
And when we're alone that's when we relax
I know I can be kinda rough on the outside
Act like I don't give a fuck when I do
But truth is I'm not really much of a tough guy
You probably already knew

Pre-Chorus
I think it's something that's deep down in me
And I just keep it inside

Chorus
I don't wanna cry in front of you
I don't know what I am tryna prove
The weight of my cards on the table
Makes it unstable and rocks like a cradle
And baby, I don't wanna cry

Verse 2
Sometimes it feels like a shock from a collar
And I'm just a dog roped up to a fence
I'm staying silent when I need to holler
Let down my guard and give up my defense

Pre-Chorus
I think it's something that's deep down in me
And I just keep it inside

Chorus
I don't wanna cry in front of you
I don't know what I am tryna prove
The weight of my cards on the table
Makes it unstable and rocks like a cradle
And baby, I don't wanna cry in front of you
I don't wanna cry in front of you

I don't wanna cry in front of you
I don't know what I am tryna prove

Flowers,1,Aybil,"[Verse 1]
I'm minding the flower
To make sure she blooms
I put water in her vase
And a little loving too
I put water in her vase
And a little loving too
I put water in her vase and
A little loving too

Cause you're not here
But I feel you everywhere

[Verse 2]
I washed all the dishes the pots and the pans
I scrapped and I scrubbed
Till I stopped thinking of you
I scrapped and I scrubbed
Till I stopped thinking of you
I scrapped and I scrubbed
Cause you're not here
But I feel you everywhere

[Outro]
Take you to the train station
Take you to the airport run
Leave my heart past
One clock is when you called my time
Wished you would've called sometime
But you sent Flowers down the line
But you sent Flowers down the line"
River of Tears,17,Eric Clapton,"It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away
And two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today
It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I'm going to hide my face
And about half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace

Chorus
Lord, how long have I got to keep on running
Seven hours, seven days or seven years
All I know is, since you've been gone
Feel like I'm drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river

Verse 2
In three more days, I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace
A year from now, maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face
I wish that I could hold you
One more time to ease the pain
But my time's run out and I got to go
Got to run away again

Chorus
Still I catch myself thinking
One day I'll find my way back here
You'll save me from drowning
Drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river
Lord, how long must it go on

Drowning
Drowning
Drowning in a river of tears"
Cashmere Sweaters,3,Edie Bens,"I've heard you've got a new job

No it's none of my business I know
No it's none of my business

I have grown a victim to
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?
All is fair in love and war
So what the hell are
we even fighting for
I'm on your front porch
begging for my dawns back
Give my goddamn records
and my clothes back
'Cause I'm through
Oh, I am through
And by the time she wakes,
I’ll be halfway to mama's home
It just dawned on me,
life is as fleeting the passing dawn
And it was my mistake
'cause she never said
a thing about Jesus
I miss my mother's southern
drawl and her praying through
the walls in the evening
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies
makes it way back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Give me my dawns back
'Cause everything that dies
makes it way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Wake me up
when the season's gone
'Cause I've wasted
all my dawns on you
So what do I do?
Oh, what I do?
And by the time he wakes
I’ll be half way to
my best friends home
It just dawned on me,
life is as fleeting
as the passing dawn
I should have told him twice
I believe in something
bigger than both of us
I miss going to out to bars
shooting stars not worrying
about whats left of us
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies
makes it way back
I lost her last July
in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Give me my dawns back
'Cause everything that dies
makes it way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory
I get fucked up just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug
I have grown a victim to

Yellow,24,Kina Grannis,"Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called ""Yellow""
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

[Chorus]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

[Verse 2]
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

[Chorus]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I'd bleed myself dry
You know I'd bleed myself dry

[Bridge]
It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

[Outro]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do"

Gold Watch and Chain (Remastered LP Ver.),6,Emmylou Harris,"Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again

Darling, how could I stay here without you
I have nothing to ease my poor heart
This old world would seem sad, love, without you
Tell me now that we never will part

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again

Take back all the gifts you have given
A diamond ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
It's a face that is false but is fair

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again

Oh, the white rose that blooms in the garden
It grows with the love of my heart
It broke through on the day that I met you
It will die on the day that we part

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again"
Every Little Thing,25,Carlene Carter,"""I hear songs on the radio
They might be fast or they might be slow
But every song they play's got me thinkin' 'bout you
I see a fella walkin' down the street
He looks at me and he smiles real sweet
But he don't matter to me
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I want to break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone

My tongue gets tied when I try to talk
My knees get weak when I start to walk
So I might as well stay home and keep thinkin' 'bout you
""""the young and the restless"""" on my tv set
That's just like us when we first met
And when they start to kissin'
Got me thinking bout you

Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I want to break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone

Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I want to break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone

We Ain't Out of Love Yet,5,Randy Travis,"You can throw away my picture, empty out my dresser drawer
Break up all the dishes, change the lock on the door
But you cant erase my memory, no matter how you try
It dont mean its over, just because you said goodbye
I'm sorry that I hurt you, but you made me so mad
If I dont care about you, why do I feel so bad
We're almost out of sugar, and our matches got wet
But we ain't out of love yet

We ain't out of love yet lets not do something hasty,baby,that we'll regret
Our lovin cup aint empty, there's still plenty left
We aint out of love yet

We might run out of gas and be left out in the rain
Could run out of ciggarettes or money again
A little out of touch or just plain out of our heads
But we aint out of love yet

We aint out of love yet
Lets not do something hasty, baby, that we'll regret
Our lovin cup aint empty theres still plenty left
We aint out of love yet

And with just a little mending we can have a happy ending
Lets forgive and forget
We dont need a lawyer now we just need a rest
Then we can ge back into doin' what we do best
Was scarlett ever through with rhett
You cant break up a perfect set
And we aint out of love yet"
50 Ways To Leave Your Lover,127,Paul Simon,"The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

She said it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways

She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free"
Evangeline,2,Emmylou Harris,"She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waitin' for a man, a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight

They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Lovin' the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin'
And bring it on back to you

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Bayou Sam from South Louisian'
Had gamblin' in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly goin' insane

High on the top of a Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin'
She watched that Queen go under

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Lodi,5,Emmylou Harris,"Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
seekin' my fame and fortune
lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

I came in on a Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
It looks like they took my friends
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Well The man from the magazine
He said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection and
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town on a one-night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh, Lord, Stuck in Lodi again
Oh lord stuck in Lodi again"

Happy Girl,4,Beth Nielsen Chapman,"I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone and a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, i was so far gone
Crying all my tears with the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me

Chorus:
Oh watch me go
I'm the happy girl, everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you've ever seen
In the whole wide world is a happy girl

I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside, feeling so left out
Standing in the corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile and my lighted fuse

Now every time i start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat

Chorus

Laugh when i feel like it
Cry when i feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes

Oh watch me go
I'm the happy girl and i've come to know
That the world won't change just 'cause i complain
Let the axis twirl i'm the happy girl
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah i'm the happy girl
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah i'm the happy girl"
Bird On A Wire,27,Johnny Cash,"Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir

Like a knight
in some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
And if I if I have been unkind
I just hope you will let it go by
And if I if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you
Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone
who reached out to me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to be
I saw a young man
leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to me
Don't ask for so much
And a young woman
leaning in her darkened door
She cried out to me
Why not ask for more
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free"

The Sound Of Silence,24,Simon & Garfunkel,"Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk
with you again
Because a vision
softly creeping
left it's seeds while
I was sleeping
And the vision
that was planted in my brain
still remains
within the sound of silence
In restless dreams
I walked alone
narrow streets
of cobblestone
'Neath the halo
of a street lamp
I turned my collar
to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
by the flash of
a neon light
that split the night
and touched the sound
of silence
And in the naked light I saw
ten thousand
people maybe more
People talking
without speaking
people hearing
without listening
people writing songs
that voices never share
And no one dare
disturb the sound of silence
Fools said I You do not know
silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that
I might teach you
Take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words
like silent raindrops fell
and echoed
in the wells of silence
And the people
bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
And the sign
flashed out it's warning
in the words
that it was forming
And the sign said The
words of the prophets are
written on the subway walls
and tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds
of silence"
Chelsea Morning,17,Joni Mitchell,"Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning"
Empty Chairs,40,Don McLean,"I feel the trembling tingle of a sleepless night
Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright

Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
And the fragrance of your flowers rest beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Never thought the words you said were true
Never thought you said just what you meant
Never knew how much I needed you
Never thought you'd leave, until you went

Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would"
Two Sparrows In A Hurricane,15,Tanya Tucker,"She's fifteen and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the keys to her heart
It's just matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly:
two sparrows in a hurri-cane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
and faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will
There's a baby crying and one more on the way
There's a wolf at the door with a big stack of bills
They can't pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other side
go to She's eighty-three and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the key to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly
go to
2 2:
Like two sparrows in a hurri-cane
Trying to find their way

All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go,



짐은 다 쌌어, 갈 준비가 됐어

I'm standing here outside your door,



너의 문 앞에 서 있어

I hate to wake you up to say good-bye.



안녕이란 말을 하기 위해 널 깨우는 건 싫지만

But the dawn is breakin',



이제 동이 트는걸

It's early morn,



이른 아침인걸

The taxi's waitin'



택시가 기다려

He's blowin' his horn,



빵빵거리고 있어

Already I'm so lonesome I could die.



난 벌써부터 너무 외로워서 죽어버릴 것만 같아



So kiss me and smile for me,



그러니 키스해줘, 날 위해 웃어줘



Tell me that you'll wait for me,



날 기다리겠다고 말해줘

Hold me like you'll never let me go.



절대로 놓지 않을 것처럼 안아줘

There's so many times I've let you down



널 실망시킨 적이 너무 많았지

So many times I've played around,



장난친 적도 너무 많고

I tell you now they don't mean a thing.



있잖아, 전부 아무 뜻도 아니었어

Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you,



가는 곳마다 널 생각할게

Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you,



부르는 노래마다 널 위해 부를게

When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.



돌아올 때는 네 결혼반지를 가져올게



So kiss me and smile for me,



그러니 키스하고 날 위해 웃어줘

Tell me that you'll wait for me,



날 기다리겠다고 해줘

Hold me like you'll never let me go.



절대로 놓지 않을 것처럼 안아줘

언제 올지도 모르니까

Oh, babe, I hate to go.



아, (베이비), 가기 싫어



Now the time has come to leave you,



이제 널 떠날 시간이 왔어

One more time let me kiss you,



한 번만 더 키스하게 해줘

Then close your eyes I'll be on my way.



그런 후에 넌 눈을 감아, 난 갈게

Dream about the days to come



앞으로 올 날들을 꿈꿔

When I won't have to leave alone,



내가 혼자 떠나지 않아도 되지 않을 때를

About the times I won't have to say:



이런 말을 하지 않아도 되는 때를



Kiss me and smile for me.



키스해줘, 날 위해 웃어줘

Tell me that you'll wait for me,



날 기다리겠다고 말해줘

Hold me like you'll never let me go.

I'm a thinkin' and a wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told,
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul,
Don't think twice it's all right."
True Lies,98,Kenny Wayne Shepherd,"Where do you go after midnight
When all the doors should be closed
Your alibis just don't sound right
I asked but nobody knows
How can you look me in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With those true lies

Someone's been sleepin' in my bed
This room don't smell like you and me
Who's that been sneakin' out the window
Do you think I'm too blind to see
When you look me in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With those true lies
It was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your true lies

You been doin' this so long now
You're thinkin' it's the truth
I guess it don't seem wrong if it
Ain't bein' done to you
Gotta lot to learn, baby
You can't keep it down
Word gets in the wind
Then it's bound to blow back around

Girl, can you give me a reason
Bet you don't even know why
Can't figure out what you're thinkin'
Or what it is you're tryin' to justify
When you look me in the eyes
Nd make it sound so very nice
With your true lies
It was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your true lies

You can laugh, you can cry
But, girl, I just can't buy
Those true lies"
I'm A Survivor,14,Reba McEntire,"I was born 3 months too early
The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must have had my
mama's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin
Even if this love's to die for
Cuz your bags are packed
And I ain't cryin
Your walkin out and I'm not tryin
To change your mind
Cuz I was born to be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom
Who works 2 jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands
And the heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
I don't believe in self pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I wanna be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom
Who works 2 jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands
And the heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
Oh a single mom
Who works 2 jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands
And the heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
But I must have had my mama's will
And God's amazing grace
I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor"
Don'T Fall In Love With A Dreamer,47,Kenny Rogers,"Just look at you sitting there
You never looked better than tonight
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'd stay
Like I've done so many times

I was so sure this would be the night
You'd close the door and want to stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'll stay
Like I've done so many times

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Oh, put out the light
Just hold on
Before we say goodbye

Now it's mornin' and the phone rings
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before ya change your mind

And if ya knew what I was thinkin', girl
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Oh, put out the light
Just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Before we say goodbye
Goodbye"
Lucille,21,Kenny Rogers,"In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot, on a barstool she took off
her ring.
I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over, I sat down and asked her
the name.
When the drinks fin'lly hit her, she said ""I'm no quitter, but I fin'lly
quit living on dreams.
I'm hungry for laughter, and, here ever after, I'm after whatever the
other life brings.

In the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him, I thought how he
looked out of place.
He came to the women who sat there beside me, he had a strange look on
his face.
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain, for a minute I
thought I was dead.
But he started shakin', his big heart was breakin', he turned to the
woman and said:

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille,
with four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times, but this time
your hurting won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille!

After he left us, I ordered more whiskey, I thought how she'd made him
look small!
From the lights of the barroom to a rented hotel room, we walked without
talking at all.
She was a beauty, but when she came to me, she must have thought I'd
lost my mind.
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her kept coming back
time after time.

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille... (twice"
Wichita Lineman (Remastered 2001),58,Glen Campbell,"I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire, I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
And I need you more than want you,
and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line"
Islands In The Stream,103,Dolly Parton,"Baby, when i met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that i can't explain
Hold me closer and i feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah

Chorus:

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly loosen' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby, i will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah

Repeat chorus

Tag:

Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me

Repeat chorus

Fade:

It's What I Do,0,Billy Dean,"I knew a man
He was a real go getter
What he did to climb
The ladder of success
And how far he went
Was how he measured
The worth of his life
And who he was
But that's all behind me now because

Loving you
It's what I do
It's the only thing I've found I can put my heart into
It's who I am
I'm a lucky man
Living the life I choose
Loving you
It's what I do

I do what I can
To make an honest living
But it's just a job it's not
What I am living for
I want to earn
The love you're giving
That's all that matters now to me
And no matter what I'll always be

Loving you
It's what I do
It's the only thing I've found I can put my heart into
It's who I am
I'm a lucky man
Living the life I choose
Loving you
It's what I do"
You've Got A Friend,0,Carole King,"""When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there yes I will

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, desert you
And take your soul if you let them, don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running running running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Long Haired Country Boy,4,Charlie Daniels,"People say I'm no good
Crazy as a loon
Cause I get stoned in the morning
And get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't no money
But I damn sure got it made

Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone

Preacher man talking on T.V.
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
Cause hes worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water
And I know that its true
But some times I think that preacherman
Would like to do a little walking too

But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Ya just leave this long haired country boy alone

A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants a vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke

But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Ya just leave this long haired country boy alone

Jolene,179,Dolly Parton,"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

A White Sport Coat,11,Marty Robbins,"A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind, it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood

I'm all dressed up for the dance
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood"
Old Friends,89,Simon & Garfunkel,"Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blowin´ through the grass
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends

Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy

Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears"
Bookends Theme (Reprise),45,Simon & Garfunkel,"Time it was and what a time it was.
It was a time of innocence.
A time of confidences.
Long ago it must be,
I have a photograph,
Preserve your memories,
They're all that's left you"

Let It Be Me,40,Willie Nelson,"I bless the day I found you

I want to stay around you

And so I beg you, let it be me



Don't take this Heaven from one

If you must cling to someone

Now and forever, let it be me



Each time we meet love

I find complete love

And without your sweet love what would life be?



So never leave me lonely

Tell me, you love me only

And that you'll always let it be me



Each time we meet love

I find complete love

And without your sweet love what would life be?



So never leave me lonely

Tell me, you love me only

And that you'll always let it be me"
Go Tell It On The Mountain,2,Simon & Garfunkel,"Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Down in a lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watch
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shown a holy light

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Down in a lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born"
Any Day Now (Remastered 2003),18,Ronnie Milsap,"Any day now
I will hear you say
Goodbye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
you will have flown, woah
Any day now, I'll be all alone
whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Any day now
when your restless eyes
meet someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows
will fall all over town, woah

Love will let me down any day now

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay-ay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holdin' on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

when the clock strikes Go?
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then my wild beautiful bird
you will have flown, woah
Any day now any day now
Love will let me down any day now

Then the blue shadows will fall
all over town, woah
Any day now any day now
Love will let me down any day now

My Last Date (With You),29,Skeeter Davis,"One hour and I'll be meeting you
I know you're gonna make me blue
My heart is trembling through and through
'Cause I know very well, I can tell, I can tell
This will be my last date with you

Just can't believe that this could end
I know, I'll never love again
You'll ask me to be just a friend
It's as plain as can be, I can see, I can see
This will be my last date with you

I know we had a quarrel
But all sweethearts do
I gave my heart to prove to you
That I would always love you and be true

I know you've met somebody new
You'll tell me, you and I are through
My plans and dreams cannot come true
And when you say goodby, I know I will cry
'Cause I know it's my last date with you"
Strawberry Wine,62,Deana Carter,"He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine"
Dreams Come True,7,Willie Nelson,"I just thought, that you would like to know
That I would, do anything, just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams come true
Well I just thought, that you would like to know, that I... I would climb the highest tree
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams, come true
I know, that it seems like, I am full of hot air
But my heart is in the right place
I swear, I swear
I just thought that you, would like to know, that I... I would do anything
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams come true
Now I know that it seems like, I'm full of hot air
But my heart
My heart is in the right place
I swear, I swear
And I just thought that you, would like to know
That I...I'd do anything...anything, just to make your dreams
Just to make your dreams come true
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams...
Come true"
Home,3,Joe Diffie,"The only thing I see ahead
Is just the heat rising off the road.
The rainbows I've been chasing keep
On fading 'fore I find my pot of gold.

And more and more I'm thinking that
The only treasures that I'll ever know
Are long ago and far behind
Wrapped up in my memories of home.

Home was a swimming hole
And a fishing pole
And the feel of a muddy road
Between my toes.
Home was a back porch swing
Where I would sit
And mama'd sing 'Amazing Grace'
While she hung out the clothes.
Home was an easy chair
With my daddy there
And the smell of
Sunday supper on the stove.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.

Now the miles I put behind me
Ain't as hard as the miles
That lay ahead.
It's way too late to listen
To the words of wisdom
That my daddy said.

The straight and narrow path
He showed me
Turned into a thousand winding roads.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.

Home was a swimming hole
And a fishing pole
And the feel of a muddy road
Between my toes.
Home was a back porch swing
Where I would sit
And mama'd sing 'Amazing Grace'
While she hung out the clothes.
Home was an easy chair
With my daddy there
And the smell of
Sunday supper on the stove.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.

The straight and narrow path
He showed me
Turned into a thousand winding roads.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home."

All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go,



짐은 다 쌌어, 갈 준비가 됐어

I'm standing here outside your door,



너의 문 앞에 서 있어

I hate to wake you up to say good-bye.



안녕이란 말을 하기 위해 널 깨우는 건 싫지만

But the dawn is breakin',



이제 동이 트는걸

It's early morn,



이른 아침인걸

The taxi's waitin'



택시가 기다려

He's blowin' his horn,



빵빵거리고 있어

Already I'm so lonesome I could die.



난 벌써부터 너무 외로워서 죽어버릴 것만 같아



So kiss me and smile for me,



그러니 키스해줘, 날 위해 웃어줘



Tell me that you'll wait for me,



날 기다리겠다고 말해줘

Hold me like you'll never let me go.

There's so many times I've let you down



널 실망시킨 적이 너무 많았지

So many times I've played around,



장난친 적도 너무 많고

I tell you now they don't mean a thing.



있잖아, 전부 아무 뜻도 아니었어

Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you,



가는 곳마다 널 생각할게

Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you,



부르는 노래마다 널 위해 부를게

When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.



돌아올 때는 네 결혼반지를 가져올게

Hold me like you'll never let me go.

아, (베이비), 가기 싫어



Now the time has come to leave you,



이제 널 떠날 시간이 왔어

One more time let me kiss you,



한 번만 더 키스하게 해줘

Then close your eyes I'll be on my way.



그런 후에 넌 눈을 감아, 난 갈게

Dream about the days to come



앞으로 올 날들을 꿈꿔

When I won't have to leave alone,



내가 혼자 떠나지 않아도 되지 않을 때를

About the times I won't have to say:



이런 말을 하지 않아도 되는 때를



Kiss me and smile for me.

You Won't See Me Go,261,Jesper Munk,"I had shards of a devilish mind

I'm gonna do it for you
I don't want a lie girl
so drop me if you don't
But if you love me
you won't see me go
I don't want a lie
so drop me if you don't
But if you love me
you won't see me go
I don't want a lie

if you love me

What You Gonna Do About Me (Feat. Beth Hart),159,Buddy Guy,"You say it's over
and you're ready to move on
You want to believe
all the fire is gone
But I feel some hesitation
even as you leave
Think it through
what you gonna do about me
It hasn't always been easy
you and I both know
But the easy way out
will be a hot way to go
Do you think you can forget
what we had so easily
Think it through
what you gonna do about me
You may go out
and find another
but what you think you
lookin for
You might think you
found a lover
but you'll still be wanting
something more
When you close your eyes
you might be surprised
at who you're gonna see
Oh baby
what you gonna do about me
So stop and think it over baby
before you leave it all behind
No matter where you go
no matter what you do
I'll still be there
in my back of the line
When you close your eyes
you might be surprised
at who you gonna see
Oh baby
what you gonna do about me
You might spend a lifetime
fighting back my memory
Now oh baby
what you gonna do about me
Oh I want you to think it through
What you gonna do
what you gonna do about me"
Eavesdrop,41,The Civil Wars,"I don't want to talk right now
I just want your arms wrapped
around
Me in this moment
Before it runs out
Oh don't say that it's over
Oh no say it ain't so
Let's let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don't care
For all that we've got don't
let go
Just hold me
I can't pull you closer than this
It's just you and the moon on
my skin
Oh who says it ever has to end
Oh don't say that it's over
Oh no say it ain't so
Let's let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don't care
For all that we've got don't
let go
Let's let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don't care
For all that we've got don't
let go
Just hold
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me"

Slip Slidin' Away,25,Paul Simon,"Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your
destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Dolores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your
destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie
in bed
And think of things that might
have been
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your
destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the
reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay
sleeping
Then he turned around and headed
home again
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your
destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We're working our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the
highway
When in fact we're slip slidin'
away
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your
destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your
destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

a lesson about being

So hard you can barely breath
And maybe you just might

Well the truth is that I never

But it’d be nice to know
that I could
Be strong enough to pull
you under throw you
back a little under thunder
Even though I never would

I wish I could crush your dreams

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,320,Dan + Shay,"Have yourself a
merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a
merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on
our troubles will be miles away
Hear we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years
we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star
upon the highest bough
And have yourself
a merry little Christmas now"
Off Guard,358,Melissa Polinar,"Everybody says you're amazing
Tell me what I don't know and
What I love about you is you're real
Everyday I think that I'm dreaming
Where did all the rain go
And its taking me awhile to see what's real
I had my head down
But when you came around
I knew there was life ahead
Beyond what's in front of me
Hey now
Thought I had it all figured out
But honey, you caught me off guard
And I had all these walls
Ready to push you out
But honey, you caught me
Caught me off guard
I never needed a rescue
Not a dame in distress
'cause all I want is a love I can see-through
Sweet-nothings are nothing
When there's absolutely nothing
For me to hold on to
I had my head down
But when you came around
I knew there was life ahead
Beyond what's in front of me
I'm tired of pretending
I'm slowly comprehending
I want toI want to be with you"

I told my mother
I say one day
I'm gonna make you proud
Now that I'm older
It's so much harder
To say those words out loud
You're growing taller
A little smarter
And one day you're gonna leave
home
Oh will you look like your
mother's father
Oh when you are fully grown
Ooh ooh oh oh oh oho ho
Ooh ooh oh ho
When I was younger
I asked my father
Why are we so human
Now that I'm older
I think I figured it out
We're just doing what we can

Close Your Eyes,106,Dan + Shay,"Monday mornin' here with you
Under this bed sheet parachute
Skin so soft, eyes so blue
The lighting strikes and the rain falls too
So let it fall, let our worries wash away
Let it roll down our windows, all wrapped up we'll stay
Lady, we can lay here and be lazy
Let it all go, I'll be a pillow, slide just a little closer, let me warm you up
Darling, drown in a river that you're caught in
I wanna get lost in your silhouette, and don't forget that red, wet kiss on my lips
we don't have to go outside, baby just close your eyes
Hold your body like a sweet, sweet rose
From your long brown hair to your curled up toes
Pull you in, keep you close
I wanna know the you nobody knows
Baby fall, you're safe here in my arms
we can cover all the windows and hide out in the dark
Lady, we can lay here and be lazy
Let it all go, I'll be a pillow, slide just a little closer, let me warm you up

The Trailer Song,160,Kacey Musgraves,"You say that you’re watching the birds out the window
Well I’ve got a bird you can watch
You ain’t gotta act like you’re borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
What’s it to you if it’s Wednesday at noon
and I’ve traded my iced tea for scotch
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
You ain’t gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwear’s on the line
It ain’t mine
I ain’t gonna ask whose been mowing your grass
So you ain’t gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your many blinds
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
Don’t ask me if I go to church
I won’t ask if your husband’s still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street
So keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
There ain’t nothing to see here

You never know
You've cried you'll cry again

You're not the only one
who seems alone
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning

It hurts it really hurts
It's in your blood
To give yourself away
For nothing much
When no one understand
you're breaking ground
You're not the only one
who can't be found
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me

As sure as the night
will cover your eyes
As sure as the voice
thats telling you lies
Counting the days
that never arrive
Any second now
As sure as the stones
that slow your feet down
As sure as the circles
turning you round
As sure as the peace
that never got found
Any second now
All of the time
you thought you got close
How hard it is to love
those old ghosts
You get the least
but you give up the most
Any second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me

Sleep Tight' Goodnight Man,6,Kenny Rogers,"The sandman told me he's done all he can
The situation calls for more than sand
You've been crying all night long
Tossing and turning and it's almost done.

I am here, I'm gonna help you sleep
Count on me instead of counting sheet
Close your eyes and leave the rest to me.

And you'll have sweet dreams at the last of night
And easy feeling and a morning light
Drift away with a touch of the hand
From the sleep tight, goodnight man.

Soft and sooth and as a lullaby
I'll kiss your tears from those weary eyes
And in the morning you will understand
That you've been touched by the goodnight man.

I'll rock you gently like a rolling wave
Hold you in my arms until you drift away
So just lay back and leave the rest to me.

And you'll have sweet dreams at the last of night
And easy feeling and a morning light
Drift away with a touch of the hand
From the sleep tight, goodnight man."
A Little More Like Me (The Crucifixion),2,Kenny Rogers,"It was an April night and I was driving
Went out on the town
The show was at the palace
So we all went on down

We all had a bomb as I recall
But now it seems absurd
As the madness raged upon the stage
He didn't say a word

He was a little weak and we all fear
It wasn't one of us
He didn't drink, he didn't smoke
And he didn't [Incomprehensible]

You'd see him now and then
With a bunch of men hanging around the sea
And I'm sure I would have liked him more
If he were a little more like me

It was a spring each day
The clouds were gray
Looked like in my dream
Thought about the night before
And I was so ashamed

When I heard what they had done to him
Stranger I had known
But as drunk as we all got last night
It's a wonder we got home

He was a little weak and we all fear
It wasn't one of us
He didn't drink, he didn't smoke
And he didn't [Incomprehensible]

You'd see him now and then
With a bunch of men hanging around the sea
And I'm sure I would have liked him more
If he were a little more like me

And I'm sure I would have liked him more
If he were a little more like me"

There Is Power In The Blood,13,Alan Jackson,"Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood

Chorus
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb

Would you be free from your passion and pride
Theres power in the blood, power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to Calvarys tide
There's wonderful power in the blood

Chorus

(during music) Would you be whiter,
much whiter than snow?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow
There's wonderful power in the blood

Winds Of Change,81,Vance Joy,"I miss you more than you could know
I watch the grass on the back lawn grow
And I will not allow winds of change to blow
And I hope you decide to come back home
Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
Cause I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love
You reach out for me in the night
And an errant finger pokes me in the eye
And I leave your contact lenses on the bedside table
And I'm hoping you decide to come back home
Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
Cause I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love
Oh, you went running with my heart
And it's a long, long, long way back
And this right here, well it just ain't living
Oh, I want you to come back
Well I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
Well I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love

What Child Is This,26,Martina McBride,"What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise the song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary"
Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,29,Sara Evans,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Let your heart be light,
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight, hm.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away.

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow,
Hang a shining star
Up on the highest bough,
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas now

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow, oh
Hang a shining star
Up on the highest bough

And have yourself a merry little Christmas"

Hold up

Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up

Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up

(And I want to...)

Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up

All my fear is running out
And I feel like I survived
'Cause I'm not the Earth and the rain doesn't wanna fall
Back when I thought that I had it all
All my feelings floodin' back for you

Am I gonna make you mine?
Can I really change your mind?
Will I get it right this time?
Will I get it right this time?

'Cause I want to believe
That I would keep fighting 'til the end
And I should have believed
That you were much more than just a friend
A friend

You've been away for far too long
Now I'm knockin' at your door
'Cause you're like the chain pullin' me where I shouldn't go
Back to the place where I'd never grow
Somethin' tells me I have changed for good

Am I gonna make you mine?
Can I really change your mind?
Will I get it right this time?
Will I get it right this time?

'Cause I want to believe
That I would keep fighting 'til the end
And I should have believed

That I was just fighting for a friend
And I should have believed
That we could have made it 'til the end

Fire And The Flood,335,Vance Joy,"I was only walking through your neighborhood
Saw you out loud honey in the cold I stood
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

I been getting used to waking up with you
I been getting used to waking up here
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Since we met I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away but I still feel you
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go there you are
Late at night when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you counting sheep
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)

There you are
There you are

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

Now listen here she said
Boy when you know you'll know
And I know

You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood"
Move,37,Luke Bryan,"Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U Haul cross a one tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you
M O V E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move
It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you
M O V E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move
Let me talk to you
M O V E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C O M E
Come on, I wanna see you
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move"

The Yuletide season's here
May the good Lord bless and keep you
Throughout the coming year
It's the time to be happy
Joyful, merry and gay
Let us all give thanks this Christmas
In our own very special way
The store windows, now,
are all glowing
With presents so shiny and new
And somewhere
there are children not knowing
What Santa, and reindeer, can do
Now the year has ended
It's time to start anew
So count your many blessings
And may all of your dreams come true
The store windows now, are all glowing
With presents so shiny and new
And somewhere
there are children not knowing
What Santa, and reindeer, can do
Now the year has ended
It's time to start anew
So count your many blessings
And may all of your dreams come true"

Cold In Ohio,68,Jamie Lawson,"This city's always moving
Nothing stays still
Somebody's always leaving
Somebody always will
There are airplanes
Taking off and landing
Lovers left behind
Without understanding
It's cold in Ohio
So I'm not going there
It's cold in Vostok station
In the middle of nowhere
It's cold in New York city
With that north wind blowing through
It's cold in Ohio
But it's warm here next to you
I understand you're worrying
I know the feeling
Love is always shifting sand
It's not much to believe in
These are the times we're living in
This is the way of the world now
I'm not giving in and you
You don't know how
It's cold in Ohio
So I'm not going there
It's cold in Vostok station
In the middle of nowhere
It's cold in New York city
With that north wind blowing through
It's cold in Ohio
But it's warm here next to you
Let the snow fall down
Let the wind blow through
It doesn't matter now
It doesn't matter now
It's cold in Ohio
So I'm not going there
It's cold in Vostok station
Out in the middle of nowhere
It's cold in New York city
With that north wind blowing through
It's cold in Ohio
But it's warm here next to you"
Heartbeat,487,Carrie Underwood,"I love it when we're at a party in a down town crowd
Oh but I can hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss, what are we waiting on
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background underneath the hardest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat"
I Wish I Was,261,Maren Morris,"On paper we go together

I know I'm breaking your heart
So go on, say what you want to
I'm not gonna stop you
You can blame it all on me
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
Cause you're looking for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Wish I could feel about you
The way you feel about me
But you can't make a heart say something
That it don't believe
So go on, hate me if you have to
I hate myself too
Cause as much as I want to be
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
Cause you're looking for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Go on, hate me if you have to
I still care about you
As much as I want to be
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
Cause you're looking for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was"

I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
The happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I just want someone to hold me, oh, and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you, yes, and give you what you need
I said, This youthful heart can love you, oh, and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

Give me one reason to stay here
Yes and I'll turn right back around

Just like you used to

And so close, to my lips
The words came, that I almost
I almost called your name

Yes I almost called
I almost called your name
In so many way's
You are both the same
The only difference, in the two
Is that I still love you
Yes I kiss't her, but
I almost called your name

Yes I kiss't her, but
I almost called your name"
Before The Next Teardrop Falls (Single Version),41,Freddy Fender,"If he brings you happiness
Then I wish you all the best

Si te quiere de verdad
Y te da felicidad
Te deseo lo mas bueno pa'los dos
Pero si te hace llorar
A mi me puedes hablar
Y estare contigo cuando triste estas

I'll be there anytime
You need me by your side
To drive away every teardrop that you cried

And if he ever leaves you blue
Just remember, I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls"
Angela,164,The Lumineers,"When you left this town,
with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align
The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind
From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Home at last
Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?
Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming in
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away
Home at last
Home at last
Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knees, I belong, I believe
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last"
Gale Song,53,The Lumineers,"It's a lonely road full of tired men
And you can see it in their faces
You'll be home in spring
I can wait 'til then
I heard you're on the big train
And oh this too shall pass
This loneliness won't last for long
I wasn't there to take his place
I was ten thousand miles away
So when you hear my voice
And when you say my name
May it never give you pain
'Cause I don't wanna go
But it's time to leave
You'll be on my mind and my destiny
And I won't fight in vain
I'll love you just the same, ooh
I couldn't know what's in your mind
But I saw the pictures
You're looking fine
And there was a time when I stood in line
For love, for love, for love
But I let you go, oh, I let you go
And he fell apart with his broken heart
And this blood, this blood, this blood
Oh, it drains from my skin, it does"

I Could Use A Love Song,170,Maren Morris,"Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick
sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye to eye
and heart to heart
But maybe I'm just getting old
Used to work but now it don't
A long gone drive
You know the kind
where you take a turn
and you don't know why
But it clears your mind
a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That'll last a little longer
I could use a love song
That takes me back

When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far
just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use
I could use a love song
I wish I didn't know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn't working
But I haven't lost all hope yet
Yeah it's hurting but it ain't dead
I could use a love song
That takes me back
just like that

To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far
just seems to go so wrong

We can just sway put your head on my shoulder, let the music come and take us over
Let me pull you in a little bit closer, baby close your eyes why don't we just
Stay right here in the moment, I wanna feel ya movin' nice and slow yeah
When there's nothin' words can say, let's dance the night away and we can just sway, yeah

It Don't Matter To The Sun,62,Rosie Thomas,"It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
No, the sun is gonna rise, gonna rise
Shine down on another day
There will be tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
Cuz it don't matter to the sun no, no
It matters to me

It ain't gonna stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world just keeps spinning round, spinning round
Like it did the day before
Cuz to them it makes no difference
It just keeps on keeping time
Cuz it ain't gonna stop the world no
But it'll be the end of mine

So what can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
Why aren't you

Cuz it don't matter to the moon
If your not in my life
No the moon will just keep hanging round, hanging round
Like its just another night
Who find another place to shine
On some other lovers dreams
Cuz it don't matter to the moon no, no
It matters to me

Cuz it don't matter to the moon no, no
But it matters to me"
Night's On Fire,15,David Nail,"Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she’s gonna be late

Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it’s a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day’s gone and the night’s on fire

She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire

She’s a seat laid back, a boy’s dream
Drawin’ hearts in the window steam
She’s a gettin’ you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline

When you know what you’re headed to
What’s a red blooded boy to do

She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire

She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire

You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire"

Just a walking on the water
You're smooth

Girl you're put together perfectly
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
A do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth

Like cat daddy driving
A Caddy from Cali baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an old can bottle by the Moon
Blackberry jam, finger licking
Off your hand flying out the window

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
There ain't nobody
A do me like you
Do me like you
The way you move that body
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth
So smooth
Smooth, smooth

You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody

A do me like you
Do me like you
The way you move that body

If it rises at all
Meet me there across the water
And we'll start an endless storm
Rain falls in love
We fall in love
Together we walk
the English winter
So caught up in one another
Who cares is we're under
thunders showers
The rain us ours
and we are lovers of
Heavy weather
Come out lightning
tries to strike us
We might be frightened
but we won't run
We be so happy
if we were fearless
And in the darkness
we will become
Rain falls in love
We fall in love
Together we walk
the English winter
So caught up in one another
Who cares if we're
under thunders showers
The rain us ours
and we are lovers of
Heavy weather
Heavy weather heavy weather

Heavy weather heavy weather

Together we walk

So caught up in one another
Who if we're under

So caught up in one another
We're crazy for
under thunders over us

Own It,245,Bailey Bryan,"I'm right even when I'm wrong

Don't care but still get jealous
Without GPS, I'm helpless
But I'm not gonna stray

Awkward in conversation

Sweatpants but I'm still a lady
Trip and fall in public, gracefully
Wild, but I'm nerdy
I party hard 'til at least 930

Who cares what they say

Flaming higher here we go

We say the words we take them in
Oh how the hills were laughing
Oh How the creeks they cried
Oh How the grass would cheer on
As we passed them by
Room for many room for few

Oh why do I hear you and believe

Didn't know if you could
Deny the dead
Leaving them in silence
On their mouldy bed
Oh I am numb
And over
Their kingdom come
Lower me down
They are dead they are dead
Oh don't cry for me
Oh don't cry for me
Oh don't cry for me
Oh don't you cry for me

Oh how the birds forget to sing
Do they know where I have been
Oh how I will leave you there again
Deep within my head of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone could I be could I be
You are my only one
You are my only one
You are my lonely one
You are my only one
Oh for the trees did grow there

Oh for they know a lovers sin

But she just can't compare to you and it really ain't her fault
I know that I should fall for her
Believe me girl I've tried

Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
No your memory won't let me

Sometimes when she's close to me I still smell your perfume
And everytime I'm holding her, I'm really holding you
And any man in his right mind would be all hers by now
But your memory won't let me

She's all good, but you're the best I ever had

Is my mind at ease or am I jaded
Has the brightest color in me faded
Have the simplest things been complicated
In a song

I was just nineteen when all this started
I was sun burned skin and open hearted
I was hometown proud, tucked in, and parted
In a song

In my dreams I'm wide awake
And I always have exactly what it takes

Oh, my constant muse
I have pinned my life on you
Chasing words and every mood
Into song

In my dreams I'm wide awake
And I always have exactly what it takes
In my dreams I'm wide awake
And I always know exactly what to say

Oh, my constant muse

And climb on every rung

Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful

"For The Widows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti",267,Sufjan Stevens,"2, 3, 4

I have called you children, I have called you son
What is there to answer if I'm the only one
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Still I must obey, still I must invite
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you

I was dressed embarrassment
I was dressed in wine
If you had a part of me, will you take your time
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life
Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you

I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father or if you haven't one
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you

And my lips won't be coloured
I don't want your diamond necklace
Your disapproval cuts through
I see the way you look at me
You don't have to tell me
I'm growing older each passing day
But my heart still remains
I bet you thought
I'd grow out of these habits
Forgive me for missing
I don't wanna wear

You feed, and you know

How can I write
The need to know
security in your eyes

What's the reason

Always try to find meaning
It gets easier

Na na na na na na na na na

The sky seems clear
Devoured with closed eyes
The end draws near
Your body severs ties

Na na na na na na na na na

Been waiting for
This moment
For too long to regret
You let go
Your spirit flows
Your troubles
Ascend

Na na na na na na na na na"
Lonely World,90,Moses Sumney,"Lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely world
Casts a shadow on the shallow love it hurls
To the feet of swine it need not cast its pearls
Lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely world
And the sound of the void
Flows through your body
Undestroyed
And the sound of your voice
Flows from your body
White as noise

Ahh

And the void speaks to you
In ways nobody
Speaks to you
And that voice fills the air
Fog in the morning
Going nowhere

Ahh

Lonely lonely lonely face under a veil
After all the laughter, emptiness prevails
Born into this world with no consent or choice
Lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely

Ahh"

One Number Away,454,Luke Combs,"Are you sitting at home all alone
trying to fall asleep
Are you staring a hole
through your phone
praying that it rings
Are you watching a movie that
you've seen a thousand times
Or maybe playing some Mayer
getting lost in your favorite lines
Well if you're anything like me
You just might be
doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl I confess
I lied when I said
I'm leaving and not coming back
Might be the whiskey
or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain dial it up
everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light
with a Marlboro Light on your lips
Does the smoke in your mirror
get clearer without my kiss
Are you changing the station
replacing our favorite songs
Well maybe it's a mistake
hit the brakes I'm moving on
Well if you're anything like me
You just might be
doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl I confess
I lied when I said
I'm leaving and not coming back
Might be the whiskey
or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain dial it up
everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick up when I call
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl I confess
I lied when I said
I'm leaving and not coming back
Might be the whiskey
or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain dial it up
everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number
away away away
Yeah I'm still one number away"

New Beginning,"1,616",Astrid Holiday,"Let’s admit
We don’t have much time
One more chance
Until we must stop tryin’
Look at me
See the fear in my eyes
It’s too soon
But I’m afraid this is goodbye
Don’t want us to part
But we’ll just have to
and hope for a new start
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new beginning
I would do anything to be
by your side
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new beginning
I would do anything
to see you again
Don’t let it be goodbye
Time stands still
When I know I can’t reach you
Don’t want us to part
But we’ll just have to
and hope for a new start
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new beginning
I would do anything to be
by your side
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new beginning
I would do anything
to see you again
Don’t let it be goodbye"

Shoe Shopping,92,Old Dominion,"Some don't last the way they should
Some make you feel good for a little while
And then you throw 'em away
Some are up on a shelf for some other day
Some are high dollar, some ain't worth a dime
But you keep 'em anyway

Everybody's looking for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye

If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
Strut down that street tonight
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high heel, high top, pump 'em up, flip flop
Heads up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patten leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size

You're stepping on cracks, you're breaking your back
You're working so damn hard just to make it look easy
Come dance with me 'cause dancings free
Let me sweep you right off your feet
Whatever your style is, girl, that's what mine is
I could go good with your eyes

If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
Strut down that street tonight
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high heel, high top, pump 'em up, flip flop
Heads up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk

Yeah, everybody's looking for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye

If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me

Heartbreaker,18,Brett Eldredge,"[Verse 1]
You're better than the movies
I know how it ends, but I can't stop
Watching you ruin me like this
I heard you slip out the door
Heard you backin' out the drive at 10 out to 4
I bet your kiss on my lips
Knowin' it's the last one that I'll get

[Chorus]
When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You're puttin' up pictures
You know, the ones I'm supposed to be in
You say I'll miss you
Then I never hear from you again
You got it down to an art
You watch me fall and disappear in the dark, yeah
You're a silent assassin, I can't stop it once it happens


[Chorus]
When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Why you gotta run, why you gotta run?
Why you gotta run, why you gotta run?

[Chorus]
When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


[Outro]
Why you gotta be a heartbreaker, heartbreaker?
You're so good at breaking my heart
Yeah it's true, all you
You little heartbreaker
Oh, you little heartbreaker
You gotta be, gotta be, gotta be
So good at breaking my heart
All you, that's what you do"

Shanghai Breezes (Remastered),6,John Denver,"It's funny how you sound as if you're right next door when you're really half a world away
I just can't seem to find the words I'm looking for to say the things that I want to say
I can't remember when I felt so close to you, it's almost more than I can bear
And though I seem a half a million miles from you, you are in my heart and living there
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same old sun up in the sky
And your voice in my ear is like heaven to me like the breezes here in old Shanghai

There are lovers who walk hand in hand in the park and lovers who walk all alone
There are lovers who lie unafraid in the dark and lovers who long for home
Oh, I couldn't leave you even if I wanted to, you're in my dreams and always near
And especially when I sing the songs I wrote for you, you are in my heart and living there
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same old sun up in the sky
And your face in my dreams is like heaven to me just like the breezes here in old Shanghai

Shanghai breezes, cool and clearing, evening's sweet caress
Shanghai breezes, soft and gentle, remind me of your tenderness
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me, like the breezes here in old Shanghai
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me, like the breezes here in old Shanghai
Just like the breezes here in old Shanghai"

Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond Of Each Other,1,Orville Peck,"Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men

And I believe to my soul that inside every man, there's the feminine
And inside every lady, there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out

And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy, don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other

What do you think all them saddles and boots was about?

And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother

And inside every lady, there's a cowboy that wants to come out

And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out"

Funny,0,Searows,"Funny how it disappears
The second you give in
When the world comes to terms with the way that it spins

Funny how you rearrange
How your mind begins to change
Hold yourself a little tighter in the arms of your old age
And when nothing else is working
And the air is getting thin
I will hold on like the first time
Feel the pulse beneath my skin

I can feel it, know it’s true
I can't heal what I hold on to

I wish I could make the promise
I am this and nothing more
But there’s a holiness in finding I was something else before
And I held my head in water
Like I wasn’t scared to drown
Like I knew when it was over
I'd be finished looking down

And am I someone you believe in
Can I trust what I can see
I’m still alive and I am breathing
You won’t take the rest of me
I can feel it I know it's true
I can’t heal what I hold onto

Give me a minute
I need another quiet day
My hands are shaking in the worst way
Give me a minute or two
Maybe a year would be enough
I’m still deciding if it’s worth it for all this stuff

I can feel it, know it’s true
I can't heal what I hold on to"
