while since she brought you down

I can't remember
what I planned tomorrow
I can't remember
when it's time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came_before
I wanted to think there was
endless love
Until I saw the light
dim in your eyes
In the dead of the night
I found out
Sometimes there's love won't survive
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful_disease
Laura kept all her disappointments
Locked up in a box behind her
closet door
She pulled the blinds
and listened to the thunder
With no way out
from the family store
We all told her things
could get better
When you just say_goodbye
I'll lay awake one_more night
Caught in a vision I want to deny
And did I mention
the note that I found
Taped to my locked front_door
It talked about no_regrets
As it slipped from my hand
to the scuffed tile floor
I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie's lullaby
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful_disease
We were full_of the stuff
that every dream rested
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattoed conclusion
That the big one was knocking
on the door
What started as a mass delusion
Would take me far_from the
place I adore
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
You are my beautiful
Such a beautiful_disease
Well you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've_been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
And you let her go
Staring_at the bottom
of your glass
Hoping one day
you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow
and they go so fast
You see her
when you close your eyes
Maybe one day
you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
But you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've_been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Staring_at the ceiling in the dark
Same_old empty
feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow
and it goes so fast
Well you see her
when you fall_asleep
But never to touch
and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too_much
and you dive too deep
Well you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've_been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
And you let her go
Oh_oh oh no
And you let her go
Oh_oh oh no
Well you let her go
'Cause you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've_been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light
when it's burning low
Only miss the sun
when it starts to snow
Only know you love her
when you let her go
Only know you've_been high
when you're feeling low
Only hate the road
when you're missing home
Only know you love her
when you let her go
And you let her go
Almost heaven
West_Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountain
Shenandoah River
Life_is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze
Country road take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country_roads
All my memories
Gather round her
Miners Lady
Stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty
Painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrops in my eyes
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country_roads
I hear her voice
in the morning hours
She calls me
The radio reminds me
of my home far_away
And driving down the road
I get a feeling
That I should have been home
Yesterday yesterday
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country_roads
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia
Mountain Mama
Take me home country_roads
Take me home country_roads
Take me home country_roads
And so it is
just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
most of the time
And so it is yes
the shorter story
No love no glory no hero in her sky
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
And so it is yes
Just like you said it should be
We will both forget the breeze
most of the time
And so it is yes
the colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
Did I say that I loathe you
Did I say that I want to
leave it all behind
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
my mind
my mind
Till I find_somebody new
Oh I woke_up with a headache
I think I might have
slept late last_night
Put my face into my pillow
Saying sorry I will make notes
I will fix my sleep schedule tonight
Oh uh oh I might
Oh uh oh I'll try
But now I just need to
wipe the sleep out of my eyes
Oh uh oh I know
Oh uh oh I won't
Make it out of my bed
if I keep biding my time
I just need some coffee
in the morning
No sugar or tea
'Cause I can feel my eyelids falling
They're trying to sleep
But if I take a sip of caffeine
Then surely I'll be
Awake until the evening
Until we go back to sleep
Now I'm waiting water's boiling
Half asleep
I'm swaying left and right
But suddenly the rich aromas
Drift up to my face and
now I'm thinking
Am I gonna stay awake today
I just need some coffee
in the morning
No sugar or tea
'Cause I can feel my eyelids falling
They're trying to sleep
But if I take a sip of caffeine
Then surely I'll be
Awake until the evening
Until we go back to sleep

Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look_out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy, linen land
Now, I understand what you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now, I think I know what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will
I'm not the kind_of girl
who should be rudely
bargin' in on a white_veil occasion
but you are not the kind_of boy
who should be
marryin' the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
this is surely not
what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say
don't say_yes run_away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single_vow
you need to hear me out
and they said_speak now
fun gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that I was uninvited
by your lovely bride to be
she floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me don't you
don't say_yes run_away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single_vow
you need to hear me out
and they said_speak now
don't say_yes run_away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single_vow
it sounds browing out
and they said_speak now
I hear the preacher say
speak_now or forever
hold your peace
there's a silence
there's my last_chance
i stand up with shaking hands
all eyes on me
horrifed looks from
everyone in the room
but i'm only lookin'_at you
i am not the kind_of girl
who should be rudely
bargin' in on a white_veil occasion
but you are not the kind_of boy
who should be marryin'
the wrong girl
don't say_yes run_away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single_vow
you need to hear me out
said_speak now
and you say
let's run_away now
i'll meet you when i'm
out of my tux at the back door
baby i didn't say my vows
so_glad you were around
when they said_speak now
Hey baby Mrs Cold
Acting so tough
Didn't know you had it
in you to be hurt at all
You waited too long
You should've hook me
Before I put my raincoat on
OK I get it
OK can I see
You were fronting because
You knew you'd find yourself
vulnerable around me
OK I get it
OK I see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey baby
What's going on
You lost control and you
lost your tongue
You lost me
Deaf in my ear
Nothing you can say
is gonna change the way I feel
OK I get it
OK I see
You were fronting because
You knew you find yourself
vulnerable around me
OK I get it
OK I see
I step too close to your boundaries
You wanted nobody around to see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey baby
What is love
It_was just a game
We're both playing
and we can't get_enough of
We're both playing
and we can't get_enough of
We're both playing
and we can't get_enough of
Oh to see without my eyes
The first_time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God deliver me
Oh_oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first_time that you touched me
Oh will wonders ever cease
Blessed be the mystery of love
Lord I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other
Oh_oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder
reminds me
How much sorrow can I take
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath
Oh_oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh will wonders ever cease
Blessed be the mystery of love
One_more time
Let’s say you give me one_more time
One_last chance to speak again
Let’s start from what we left unsaid
and here we go
Brave enough to go climbing a wall
so high that no sunlight
is seen through winter
Brave enough to go traveling
around the world
without money to eat or sleep for
Seeing what you can do
with your hands and feet
I feel there is no question about it:
Almost anything you can imagine
Almost any goal
You will get there
I wish you had been more of a talker
Not the kind that is
just flapping his lips
And not the kind that looks away
But learns through his eyes
when somebody is watching
Maybe you could have told me
There was a world on your shoulders
that needed lifting
Maybe I could have
helped you with that
The weight is not easy I know
But you never know
I thought your shoes were good
I thought they would take you
to the end of any road
I thought your back was strong
I should have carried you
to the top of the rocky I trail
I should have carried you
to the top of the rocky trail
How am I to know about
your problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
How am I to know about
your problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
You are the icing on my cake
You are the smile I can`t replace
You_are, you are,
The way you smile, the way you laugh,
The way I can`t help but catch your joy, your joy
Metaphorically, this song just says one_thing
I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean
I love you, I love you
You are the minutes of my time
You`re inspiration to this rhyme
You_are, you are
You are the apple of my eye,
The sweet sunshine in the sky
You_are, you are
Metaphorically, this song just says one_thing
I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean
I love you, I love you
You_are, you are
You_are, you are
When cloudy days come along,
When you`re not really
Hear this song and know, just know
If sad times steal your joy
Ring me up and hear my voice
"I_love you`s" tend to mute the noise
Metaphorically, this song just says one_thing
I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean
I love you, I love you,
Metaphorically, this song just says one_thing
I love you, that`s what I`m telling you
Oh, and there`s no irony because I say what I mean
I love you, I love you,
You_are, you are
You are every bit of beautiful
You_are, you are
You are every bit of beautiful
You say you'll be down in 5
The smell of your perfume is
floating down the stairs
You're fixing up
your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be_surprised
It happens_every time
It's nothing new
It's always on a night like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
Cause when you look_at me
with those eyes
I'm_speechless
Staring_at you
standing_there in that dress
What it's doing to me
ain't a secret
Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know that
you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've_been in a daze
Ever_since the day that we meet
You take the breath out of my lungs
I can't even fight it
And all of the words
out of my mouth
without even trying
And I'm_speechless
Staring_at you
standing_there in that dress
What it's doing to me
ain't a secret
Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know that
you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
It's always on a night like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
Cause when you look_at me
with those eyes
I'm_speechless
standing_there in that dress
What it's doing to me
ain't a secret
Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know that
you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
Oh you know it baby
Do you love the rain
does it make you dance
When you're drunk
with your friends at a party
What's your favorite_song
does it make you smile
Do you think of me
When you close your eyes
tell me what are you dreamin'
Everything I wanna know it all
I'd spend_ten thousand_hours
and ten_thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes
to learn
that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there
but I'm gonna try
If it's ten_thousand hours
or the rest_of my life
I'm gonna love you
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
Do you miss the road
that you grew_up on
Did you get your middle name
from your grandma
When you think
about your forever now
do you think of me
When you close your eyes
tell me what are you dreamin'
Everything I wanna know it all
I'd spend_ten thousand_hours
and ten_thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes
to learn
that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there
but I'm gonna try
If it's ten_thousand hours
or the rest_of my life
I'm gonna love you
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
I'm gonna love you
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
Ooh want the good and the bad
and everything in between
Ooh gotta cure my curiosity
Ooh yeah
I'd spend_ten thousand_hours
and ten_thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes
to learn
that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there
but I'm gonna try
If it's ten_thousand hours
or the rest_of my life
I'm gonna love you
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
I'm gonna love you
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
And I
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I shoulda_known it
wouldn't happen
'cause it wasn't right
I shoulda_known it
'cause it happens
every God damn time
Almost thought
we could've been something
Almost thought
we could have tried but
It didn't happen
so I need you to get out my life
But the other night
I had you in my head
Called you on the phone
Want you stealing my time
even_though I said
I wanna be alone
Oh and I should know
this could never work
Oh this could never end well
Know it's only human
but I never learn
I want you for myself
I can take the fall the pain
the pleasure
And you can take it all
for worse_or better
But oh what if we're wrong
What if we're not all that we thought
Then we won't make it along
But hey I guess_that's us
We couldn't help it
but you know that
doesn't make it right
You say I'm selfish
but I know you felt the same inside
Everybody says it's all okay
Everybody says we're fine but
Guess someone_else is
what you need to
make you feel alright
But tomorrow night
I'll probably call a cab
Show up at your door
Love you in the night time
leave you in your bed
Cold and wanting_more
Oh and I should know
this could never work
Oh this could never end well
Know it's only human
but I never learn
I need you for myself
I can take the fall
the pain the pleasure
And you can take it all
for worse_or better
But oh what if we're wrong
What if we're not all
that we thought
Then we won't make it along
But hey I guess_that's us
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm
I can take the fall
the pain the pleasure
And you can take it all
for worse_or better
But oh what if we're wrong
What if we're not
all that we thought
Then we won't make it along
But hey I guess_that's love
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong
and carry on
Cause I know
I don't belong
Here in heaven
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven
I'll find my way
through night and day
Cause I know
I just can't stay
Here in heaven
Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please
Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know
there'll_be no more
Tears in heaven
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong
and carry on
Cause I know
I don't belong
Here in heaven
Cause I know
I don't belong
Here in heaven
When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just
can't be found
Like a_bridge over
troubled_water
I will lay me down
Like a_bridge over
troubled_water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness_comes
And pain is all around
Like a_bridge over
troubled_water
I will lay me down
Like a_bridge over
troubled_water
I will lay me down
Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are
on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a_bridge over
troubled_water
I will ease your mind
Like a_bridge over
troubled_water
I will ease your mind
Les reves des amoureux
sont comme le bon vin
Ils donnent de la joie
ou bien du chagrin
Affaibli par la faim je
suis malheureux
Volant en chemin
tout ce que je peux
Car rien n'est gratuit dans la vie
L'espoir est un plat bien
trop vite consomme
A sauter les repas je suis habitue
Un voleur solitaire
est triste a nourrir
A un jeu si amer je n'peux reussir
Car rien n'est gratuit dans
La vie Jamais on ne me dira
Que la course aux etoiles
ca n'est pas pour moi
Laissez-moi vous emerveiller
et prendre mon envol
Nous allons enfin nous regaler
La fete va enfin commencer
Sortez les bouteilles
fini les ennuis
Je dresse la table
de ma nouvelle vie
Je suis heureux a l'idee
de ce nouveau destin
Une vie a me cacher
et puis libre enfin
Le festin est sur mon chemin
Une vie a me cacher
et puis libre enfin
Le festin est sur mon chemin
I know you think I got it
all figured_out 'cause
I walk around like
my head's in the clouds but
I'm just a boy
with his heart pourin' out
Of his head
I wish that you could see the pain
that I've_seen and
All of the times
I spent being not me and
I hope you know
that it's not always happy
In my head
'Cause I don't know
The perfect road to go down
But I know
I'm trying my best
I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard
And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath til' I can say
All of the words I want to say
From my heart
If you really wanted
I could let you inside
It's been so long and
I've got nothing_left to hide
Would you believe me
if I told you that I've
Got flaws
Now it's time to
let the curtains unfold and
Tell all the stories that
I didn't want told yeah
Let it out so I unburden my soul
I won't stop
'Cause I don't know
The perfect road to go down
But I know
I'm trying my best
I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard
And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath til I can say
All of the words I want to say
From my heart
I'm trying my best
I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard
And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath til I can say
All of the words I want to say
From my heart
There I was again tonight
forcing laughter
faking_smiles Same_old tired
lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when I saw your_face
All I can say is it was
enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered
have we met
Across the room your silhouette
starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was
enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
I was_enchanted to meet you
The lingering queestion
kept me up
2AM who do you love
I wonder to I'm right awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It_was enchanting to met you
All I know is I was
enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
This night is flawless
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
I was_enchanted to meet you
This_is me praying that
this was the very_first page
Not where the story line ends
My_thoughts will echo your name
until I see you again
These_are the words
I held back as I was
leaving too_soon
I was_enchanted to meet you
Please_don't be in love
with someone_else
Please_don't have somebody
waiting on you
Please_don't be in love
with someone_else
Please_don't have somebody
waiting on you
This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
This night is flawless
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
I was_enchanted to meet you
Please_don't be in love
with someone_else
Please_don't have somebody
waiting on you
We were both_young
when I first_saw you
I close my eyes and
the flashback starts
I'm standing_there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party
the ball gowns
See you make your way
through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were_Romeo
you were throwing_pebbles
And my daddy_said
Stay away_from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you
Please_don't go and I said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story_baby just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden
to see you
We keep quiet
'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town
for a little while oh_oh
'Cause you were_Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy_said
Stay away_from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you
Please_don't go and I said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story_baby just say Yes
Romeo_save me
they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid
we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story_baby just say Yes
Oh_oh
And I got tired_of waiting
Wondering if you were
ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you
on the outskirts of town
And I said Romeo_save me
I've_been feeling so alone
I keep waiting_for you
but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet
you'll_never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
go pick out a white_dress
It's a love story_baby just say Yes
Oh_oh oh
Oh_oh oh
'Cause we were both_young
when I first_saw you
Loving_him is like
driving a new_Maserati
down a dead-end_street
Faster than the wind
passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
Loving_him is like
trying to change your mind
once you're already flying
through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright
just before they lose it all
Losing_him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark_grey
all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving_him was red
Loving_him was red
Touching him_was like realizing
all you ever wanted was right
there in front_of you
Memorizing him_was as
easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite_song
Fighting with him_was like
trying to solve a crossword and
realizing there's_no right answer
Regretting him_was like
wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
Losing_him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark_grey
all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving_him was red
Oh red
Burning red
Remembering him comes
in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now
gotta let go
But moving on
from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning_red
Burning it was red
Oh losing him_was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark_grey
all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving_him was red
Yeah_yeah red
We're burning_red
And that's why he's spinnin'
'round in my head
Comes back to me burning_red
Yeah_yeah
His love was like
driving a new_Maserati
down a dead-end_street
Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone_else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part_of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk_with everyone_else
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone_else
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone_else
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone_else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part_of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk_with everyone_else
Once_upon a time
a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
you got me alone
You found me you found me
you found me
I guess you didn't care
and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
you took a step back
Without me without me without me
And he's long gone
when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been
'Til you put me down oh
I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been
Now I'm lying
on the cold hard ground
Oh oh-oh
Trouble_trouble trouble
Oh oh-oh
Trouble_trouble trouble
No apologies
he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason_why
You're drowning you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all
I'll ever be
And now I see now I see
Now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
hey
I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in oh
So shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been
'Til you put me down oh
I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places
I'd never been yeah
Now I'm lying
on the cold hard ground
Oh oh-oh yeah
Trouble_trouble trouble
Oh oh-oh
Trouble_trouble trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her or anyone
or anything yeah
I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places
I'd never been never been
'Til you put me down oh
I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in
Knew it right there
So shame on me now
knew it right there
Flew me to places
I'd never been ooh
Now I'm lying
on the cold hard ground
Oh oh-oh
Trouble_trouble trouble oh
Oh oh-oh
Trouble_trouble trouble
I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in
Trouble_trouble trouble
I knew you were_trouble
when you walked in
Trouble_trouble trouble
When it_rains it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe
when all you know is
The struggle of stayin'
above the risin' water line
Well the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out
in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well darlin' I'm just
tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
hangin' over your head
If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow red and orange and green
And at_least a million others
So tie up the bow
take off your coat
and take a look around
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out
in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well darlin' I'm just
tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
hangin' over your head
Oh tie up the bow take off your coat
and take a look around
Everything is alright now
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out
in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause darlin' I'm just
tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
hangin' over your head
Yeah there's always been a rainbow
hangin' over your head
It'll all be alright
White lips pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Light's gone day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since_18
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly_sinking wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
And they scream
The_worst things in life
come free to us
'Cause we're just
under the upper-hand
And go mad for a_couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside
tonight
And in a pipe
she_flies to the Motherland
Or_sells love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary-eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since_18
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly_sinking wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
And they scream
The_worst things in life
come free to us
'Cause we're just
under the upper_hand
And go mad for a_couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside
tonight
And in a pipe
she_flies to the Motherland
Or_sells love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes
and hopin' for a better life
This time we'll fade_out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since_18
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly_sinking wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
They scream
The_worst things in life
come free to us
And we're all under the upper-hand
And go mad for a_couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside
tonight
And in a pipe
we fly to the Motherland
Or_sells love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly_fly
For_angels to fly
To fly to fly
For_angels to die
Give me the keys
I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so called friends
they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no no
There's a chain 'round your throat
piece_of paper where I wrote
I'll wait for you
There's a key on the chain
there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you
And run
like you'd run from the law
Darling let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no_one else is run
Ooh_we'll run
Ooh_we'll run
Ooh_we'll run
So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no_one cares
No one to be no_one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue_sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no no
And the note from the locket
you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you
And run
like you'd run from the law
Darling let's run
Run from it all
We can go like
they're trying to chase us
Go where no_one else is run
Ooh_we'll run
Ooh_we'll run
Ooh_we'll run
There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll_never let_'em tear us apart
And I'll hold_onto you while we run
And we run and we run and we run
Like you'd run from the law
And we run and we run and we run
Darling let's run
And we run and we run and we run
Run from it all
And we run and we run and we run
We can go where our eyes can take us
And we run and we run and we run
Go where no_one else is run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh_we'll run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh_we'll run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh_we'll run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh and we'll_run
I'm so_glad
you made time to see me
How's life
tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've_been good
busier then ever
Small talk
Work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time
you saw me Still
burns in the back of your mind
You gave me roses
and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front_of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
Turns out freedom aint
nothing but missing you
Wishing that I realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and make it alright
I go back to December
all the time
These day's
I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back
myself pleading
When your birthday passed
and I didn't call
And I think_about summer
all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing
from the Passenger side
Realized that I loved you
in the fall
Then the cold came
the dark days when
fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
and all I gave you was
goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front_of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
Turns out freedom aint
nothing but missing you
Wishing that I realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December
all the time
I miss your tan skin
and your sweet smile
so good to me so right
And how you held me
in your arms that September night
The first_time
you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably my less dreaming
If we loved again
I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time
and change it
but I can't
So if the chain is on your door
I understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front_of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
Turns out freedom aint
nothing but missing you
Wishing that I realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December
turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December
all the time
All the time
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't_help
falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't_help
falling in love with you?
Like a river_flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some_things are meant to be
So take my hand
Take my whole_life too
For I can't_help
falling in love with you
For I can't_help
falling in love with you
Loving_him is like driving
a new_Maserati down
a dead-end_street
Faster than the wind
passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
Loving_him is like trying
to change your mind once
you're already flying
through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright
just before they lose it all
Losing_him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark gray
all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
But loving_him was red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Red_red red
But loving_him was red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Touching him_was like
Realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front_of you
Memorizing him_was as
Easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite_song
Fighting with him_was like
Trying to solve a crossword
and realizing
there's_no right answer
Regretting him_was like
Wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
Losing_him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark gray
all alone Woah
Forgetting_him was like
Trying to know somebody
you never met
But loving_him was red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Oh red Red_red red
Red_red red
Burning red Red_red red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Red_red red
Remembering him comes
in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now
gotta let go
But moving on
from him is impossible
And I still see it all in my head
In burning_red
Burning it was red
Oh losing him_was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark gray
all alone Woah
Forgetting_him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving_him was red
Red_red red_red red_red
Yeah_yeah red
Red_red red_red red_red
Burning red
Red_red red_red red_red
Red_red red_red red_red
And that's why he's spinning
'round in my head
Red_red red_red red_red
Comes back to me
Red_red red_red red_red
burning_red
Red_red red_red red_red
Yeah_yeah
Red_red red_red red_red
His love was like driving
a new_Maserati down
a dead-end_street
I remember when we broke up
the first_time
Saying This_is it
I've had enough 'cause like
We hadn't seen each_other
in a month
When you said you
needed space What
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear
I'm gonna change trust me
Remember how that
lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up

you picking fights
And me falling for it
screaming that I'm right

and find your peace of mind
With some indie record

Getting_back together
through the alleyways
to cool off in the shadows
then into the street
following the water
there's a bearded man
paddling in his canoe
looks as if he has
come all the way from
the cayman islands
these canals it seems
they all go in circles
places look the same
and we're the only difference
wind is in your hair
it's covering my view I'm
holding on to you
on a bike we've hired
until tomorrow
if only they could see
if only they had been here
they would understand
how someone could have chosen
to go the length I've gone
to spend just one day riding
holding on to you
I never thought it
would be this clear
Last night we let the liquor_talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish
I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby_somethin's
tellin' me this ain't over_yet
No way it was our_last night
I kiss your_lips
Make you grip the sheets
with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' about life
goin' sip for sip, yeah
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake_up
wantin' you and me
I know that last_night
we let the liquor_talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish
I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby_somethin's
tellin' me this ain't over_yet
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
No way it was the last_night
that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You called your momma,
I call your bluff
In the middle_of the night,
pull her right back up
Yeah my, my friends say "Let her go"
Your friends say "What the hell?"
I wouldn't_trade your kind_of love
for nothin' else
Oh baby, last_night
we let the liquor_talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish
I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby_somethin's
tellin' me this ain't over_yet
No way it was our_last night,
we said we'd had enough
I can’t remember everything
we said but we said too_much
I know you packed your shit and
slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin’s
tellin’ me this ain’t over_yet
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
I know you said this time you
really weren’t comin' back again
But baby, baby somethin’s
tellin’ me this ain’t over_yet
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
It's late in the evening
she's wondering
what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up
and brushes her long_blonde hair
And then she_asks me
Do I look all right
And I say
Yes you look wonderful_tonight
We go to a party
and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
that's walking around with me
And then she_asks me
Do you feel all right
And I say
Yes I feel wonderful_tonight
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
how_much I love you
It's time to go home now
and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car_keys
and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her
as I turn out the light
I say My darling
you were wonderful_tonight
Oh my darling
you were wonderful_tonight
It_was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't_expecting that
Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed
I wasn't_expecting that
Did I misread the sign
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't_expecting that
You spent the night in my bed
You woke_up and you said
Well I wasn't_expecting that
I thought love wasn't_meant to last
I thought you were
just passing_through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right
to deserve somebody like you
I wasn't_expecting that
It_was only a word
It_was almost misheard
I wasn't_expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't_expecting that
I thought love wasn't_meant to last
Honey I thought you
were just passing_through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right
to deserve somebody like you
I wasn't_expecting that
Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed
If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't_expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
I wasn't_expecting that
When the nurses they came
Said It's come_back again
I wasn't_expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by_surprise
I wasn't_expecting that
You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
Do yo remember when
we used_to live things separate
we hadn't met or thought
that could be possible
I'm glad you had your life
so good to listen to your past
all of those things brought you
with me and now we're two
You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before
But if I try to think
of something better_than this
heaven comes down
and reminds the luck we live
You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake_up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then
Don't you just wanna wake_up
Dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire
Lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe
I think it's great
But while in this world
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee_black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee_black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me
I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest_of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong
You know you're bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel
Maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd_rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee_black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee_black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee_black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I'm gonna pick_up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong
we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one_thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold_December
but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend you
and I'll keep you sheltered
from the storm that's_raging on now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up when
you're getting down
And out of all these_things
I've_done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things
I've_done I think I love
you better now now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame
it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
but I've_been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up
when you're getting down
And out of all these_things
I've_done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things
I've_done I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
and it's more_than I can take
And it's dark in a cold_December
but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend you
and I'll keep you sheltered
from the storm that's_raging on now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up
when you're getting down
And out of all these_things
I've_done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things
I've_done I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up when
you're getting down
And out of all these_things I've_done
I will love you better now
We're in the homestretch
of the hard times
We took a hard left
but we're alright
Yeah life sure can try
to put love through it but
We built this right
so nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good
the rest don't matter
Yeah the paint could peel
the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you
and I remain the same
When there_ain't a crack
in the foundation
Baby I know any_storm
we're facing
Will blow right over
while we stay put
The house don't fall
when the bones are good
Call it dumb luck but baby
you and I
Can't even mess it up
although we_both try
No it don't always go the way
we planned it
But the wolves came
and went and we're still standing
When the bones are good
the rest don't matter
Yeah the paint could peel
the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you
and I remain the same
When there_ain't a crack
in the foundation
Baby I know any_storm
we're facing
Will blow right over
while we stay put
The house don't fall
when the bones are good
When the bones are good
Bones are good the rest
the rest don't matter
baby it don't really matter
Paint could peel
the glass could shatte
oh the glass oh

Bones are good the rest

Paint could peel the glass

When the bones are good
the rest don't matter
Yeah the paint could peel

Let it rain let it rain let it

'Cause you
and I remain the same woo
When there_ain't a crack
in the foundation woo
Baby I know any_storm
we're facing
Will blow right over
while we stay put
The house don't fall
when the bones are good
Yeah ooh
We were both_young
when I first_saw you
I close my eyes and the
flashback starts
I'm standing_there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party
the ball gowns
See you make your way
through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were_Romeo
you were throwing_pebbles
And my daddy_said
Stay away_from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you
Please_don't go and I said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story_baby
just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden
to see you
We keep quiet
'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town
for a little while oh_oh
'Cause you were_Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy_said
Stay away_from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you
Please_don't go and I said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story
baby just say Yes
Romeo_save me
they're trying to tell me
how to feel
This love is difficult
but it's real
Don't be afraid
we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story
baby just say Yes
Oh_oh
And I got tired_of waiting
Wondering if you were ever
coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you
on the outskirts of town
And I said Romeo_save me
I've_been feeling so alone
I keep waiting_for you
but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and
pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet
you'll_never have to be alone
I love you and
that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
go pick out a white_dress
It's a love story
baby just say 'Yes'
Oh_oh oh
Oh_oh oh
'Cause we were both_young
when I first_saw you
Walking to work at 5 am
Cause some bastard
stole my car
Moved to L A to live the dream
But minimum wage is
all I got so far
Twelve hours later
walking home in the rain
I'm so tired I could cry
But after my shift I got an_hour
in the studio
I wrote an awesome song
and that's why
I'm gonna celebrate
my day with top ramen tonight
oh yeah
My future's lookin'
so damn bright
I'm super duper fancy
got my wine in a box oh yeah
I know my life fuckin' rocks
it fuckin' rocks
I got one penny-a_two penny-a
three_penny four
Can't believe I worked
this hard to be this poor
One penny-a_two penny-a
three_penny four
I can hear my landlord
knockin' at my door
All I need is a hunderd
thousand pennies mo-o-ore
Work all day and
dream all night
I'm topping charts
with my guitar
Manager called me
said I got a gig
It_doesn't pay but it's good PR
So I'm gonna celebrate my day
with top ramen tonight
oh yeah
My future's lookin'
so damn bright
I'm super duper fancy
got my wine in a box oh yeah
I know my life fuckin' rocks

Are you really here
or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams
from truth
for it's been so long
since I have seen you
I can_hardly remember
your_face anymore
When I get really lonely
and the distance
causes our silence
I think of you smiling
with pride in your eyes
a lover that sighs
If you want me satisfy me
if you want me satisfy me
Are you really sure
that you'd believe me
when others say I lie
I wonder_if you could
ever despise me
when you know I really try
to be a better
one to satisfy you
For your everything to me
and I'll do what you ask me
if you'll let me be free
If you want me satisfy me
if you want me satisfy me
If you want me satisfy me
if you want me satisfy me
Do you remember when we were
two beautiful birds
We would light up the sky
when we'd fly
You were orange and red like
the sun when it sets
I was green as an apple's eye
You said you loved all the songs
that I'd sing
But nothing like you'd ever heard
And I said I loved you
with all of my heart when
we were two beautiful birds
Do you remember when we were
two beautiful birds
We would sing when the morning
would come
You were silver and blue like
the moon when it's new
I was gold as a summer sun
But one day you asked for
a different song
One that I just couldn't sing
I got the melody sharp
and the words all wrong
Those_were the last days of spring
To build a nest we pecked
feathers from our chests
Like a book tearing out every page
We weren't to know that these
feathers would grow
Into a beautiful cage
White lips pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Light's gone day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since_18
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly_sinking wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
And they scream
The_worst things in life
come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a_couple of grams
And she don't want to
go outside tonight
And in a pipe she_flies to the
Motherland
Or_sells love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since_18
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly_sinking wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
And they scream
The_worst things in life come
free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a_couple of grams
But she don't want to
go outside tonight
And in a pipe she_flies to the
Motherland
Or_sells love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time we'll fade_out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since_18
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly_sinking wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
They scream
The_worst things in
life come
free to us
And we're all under the upperhand
Go mad for a_couple of grams
And we don't want to
go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the
Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly_fly
Angels to fly to fly to fly
Angels to die
Breakfast at noon
You bought me fake flowers
I water them too
Laughing for hours
The TV is on
We’re not watching a thing
Your new guitar
Your old worn_out sweater
Said we could go far
If you could do better
I know, there’s nowhere left to go
So we just go back to bed
Waiting_for something
to change you
Breakfast at noon
The milk has gone sour
A waste of a muse
Logging the hours
The TV is on
Acting like nothing is wrong
Breakfast at noon
I cry in the shower
We call it a truce
Give all my power to you
Do you regret
what I put you through?
Waiting_for something
to change you
Let’s go back to the start
Cuz you might just break this heart

We let the waters rise
We drifted to survive
I needed you to stay
But I let you drift away
My love where are you
My love where are you
Whenever you're_ready
whenever_you're ready
Whenever you're_ready
whenever_you're ready
Can we can we surrender
Can we can we surrender
I surrender
No one will win this time
I just want you back
I'm running to your side
Flying my white flag
my white flag
My love where are you
My love where are you
Whenever you're_ready
whenever_you're ready
Whenever you're_ready
whenever_you're ready
Can we can we surrender
Can we can we surrender
I surrender
I surrender
Uh-uh, uh, uh
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve_been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
Uh-uh, uh, uh
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh,_oh, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
Uh-uh, uh, uh
I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note saying, "Meet me tonight"
Then we kissed and you know I won’t ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself
Uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh,_oh
I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you, oh, I can see you
Oh, I see you, I see you, baby
I see you
(Uh-uh, uh, uh) I see you, I see you, baby
Oh, baby
She always said if something ever
Happened to me she would never
Fall in love again
oh what a waste
We always said we go together
But if I'm just half
of her forever
This goes out
to whoever takes my place
She don't give two sips
'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she_wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home
if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth
and your grammar
She_loves babies hates glitter
You better shave
'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please_don't let her
She's insecure
about her legs right
Something wrong
with her hair right
Just tell her she's crazy Crazy
Even_though
she won't believe you nah
Best advice I can give you
brother
Don't ever say
she's acting just like her mother
Even_though she_does
sometimes Sometimes
It's gon' be our little secret
She don't give two sips
'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she_wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home
if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth
and your grammar
She_loves babies hates glitter
You better shave
'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please_don't let her
Make her feel better
Say something funny

And if she's thinking
she can love again

Orchids

Don't ever watch
The Office without her
After church After church

Made some breakfast
Made some love
This_is what dreams are made of
On a cloudy Monday morning
Summers gone and you're still here
For both of us it's been a year
A tidal wave without a warning
Please_don't make me regret
Opening up that part_of myself
And I've_been scared to give again
Be good to me and I'll be good to you
But please don't be too good to be true
In my mind we're in New_York
You had never been before
But baby now it's our town
I'll admit that I'm in deep
That I don't know how else to be
And I don't wanna slow down
Please_don't make me regret
Opening up that part_of myself
And I've_been scared to give again
Be good to me and I'll be good to you
But please don't be too good to be true
Made some breakfast
Made some love
If this is what dreams are made of
Please_don't wake me
It's late in the evening
She's wondering what
clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long
blond hair
And then she_asks me
Do I look alright
And I say_yes
you look wonderful_tonight
We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking
around with me
And then she_asks me
Do you feel alright
And I say_yes
I feel wonderful_tonight
I feel wonderful
Because I see
the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just
don't realize
How much I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car_keys
She helps me to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn out the light
I say my darling
you were wonderful_tonight
Oh my darling
you were wonderful_tonight
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt
like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there
at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car
getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down
like pieces into place
And I can picture it
after all these_days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
but I'm not fine at all
Oh_oh oh
'Cause there we are again
on that little town street
You almost ran the red
'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too_well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used_to be a little_kid
with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories
'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past
thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing_else I could do
And I forget_about you long_enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again
in the middle_of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too_well yeah
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too_much
But maybe this thing
was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too_well
And you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name
of being_honest
I'm a crumpled up piece
of paper lying_here
'Cause I remember it all all all
Too well
Time won't fly
it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very_first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid_of it
'Cause you remember it
all too_well yeah
'Cause there we are again
when I loved you so
Back before you lost
the one real thing
you've ever known
It_was rare I was there
I remember it all too_well
Wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
It_was rare I was there
I remember it all too_well
If you're going to San_Francisco
Be sure to wear
Some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San_Francisco
You're gonna meet
Some gentle people there
For those_who come to San_Francisco
Summer time will be a lovin' there
In the streets of San_Francisco
Gentle people with
flowers in their hair
All across the nation
Such a strange vibration
People in motion
There's a whole generation
With a new explanation
People in motion
People in motion
For those_who come to San_Francisco
Be sure to wear
Some flowers in your hair
If you come to San_Francisco
Summer time will be a lovin' there
If you come to San_Francisco
Summer time will be a lovin' there
To every girl I ever loved
I tried my best
but it wasn't enough
You know I was just growing up
and what I was going through
To every girl who took my hand
and listened to my wild plans
Hope by now you understand
how_much I learned from you
I wish I knew where you are today
'Cause if I did
I'd get to say
Thank you for sharing
the best years of my life
All of the good_times
and tears that we cried
Ooh_ooh
And if I become
half the man I want to
I hope you know I know
It's all_because of you
Ooh_ooh
Yeah it's all_because of you
Ooh_ooh
To every girl I've ever kissed
For all the nights I won't forget
Lost in all our innocence
I'd do it all again
To every girl that
gave me her heart
Wherever you go
wherever you are
I swear you'll always
be a part_of who I am
So thank you for sharing
the best years of my life
Ooh yeah
All of the good_times and
tears that we cried
Ooh_ooh
And if I become
half the man I want to
I hope you know I know

This has got to die
This has got to stop
This has got to lie down
Someone else on top
You can keep me pinned
It's easier to tease
But you can't paint an elephant
Quite as good as she
And she may cry like a baby
And she may drive me Crazy
'Cause I am lately lonely
So why d'you have to lie?
I take it I'm your crutch
The pillow in your pillow case
It's easier to touch
And when you think you've sinned
Do you fall upon your knees?
And do you sit within your picture?
Do you still forget the breeze?
And she may rise, if I sing you down
And she may wisely cling to the ground
Cause I'm lately horny
So why would she take me horny?
What's the point of this song? Or even singing?
You've already gone, why am I clinging?
Well I could throw it out, and I could live_without
And I could do it all for you
I could be strong
Tell me if you want me to lie
'Cause this has got to die
This has got to stop
This has got to lie down, down
With someone_else on top
You can both keep me pinned
'Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't make me happy
Quite as good as me
Well you know that's a lie
Don't know where you at, don't know where you've_been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie
[Chorus]
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin'_'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every_time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're_tastin' what he's_drinkin', are you thinkin'_'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin'_'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin'_'bout
When you're_tastin' what he's_drinkin', are you thinkin'_'bout me?
[Verse_2]
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't
[Chorus]
When you're_tastin' what he's_drinkin', are you thinkin'_'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every_time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're_tastin' what he's_drinkin', are you thinkin'_'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin'_'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin'_'bout
When you're_tastin' what he's_drinkin', are you thinkin'_'bout me?
[Bridge]
Don't know where you at
But girl, I know where you oughta be
[Chorus]
When you're_tastin' what he's_drinkin', are you thinkin'_'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?
Every_time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're_tastin' what he's_drinkin', are you thinkin'_'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin'_'bout me?
Yeah, are you thinkin'_'bout me?
Are you thinkin'_'bout me?
I used_to all night Friday chase it
Wake_up still whiskey wasted
Hair of the dog and do it all again
It_was a Coke can Copenhagen
That smoke it never faded
And up till now it's where it's always been
I used_to take straight shots to get a buzz
But ever since those blue eyes messed me up
I take the girl out rollin' down a back road
Underneath the moon glow
We burnin' all night
I take the girl out, hit a little uptown
Watch her body slow down
Like Makers on ice
When I want my head_spinnin'
A fix that never misses
To get the highest high in the world
I take the girl, I take the girl
I take the girl back home to mamma
Cut up at Sunday supper
Still ain't a saint but she's getting me closer
When I raise hell we're together
I swear the rush is better
And I ain't ever hungover
When I take the girl out rollin' down a back road
Underneath the moon glow
We burnin' all night
I take the girl out, hit a little uptown
Watch her body slow down
Like Makers on ice
When I want my head_spinnin'
A fix that never misses
To get the highest high in the world
I take the girl, I take the girl
Call me lost cause addicted
No way I can quit it
I'd give up everything else in the world
To take the girl out, rollin' down a back road
Underneath the moon glow
We burnin' all night
I take the girl out, hit a little uptown
Watch her body slow down
Like Makers on ice
When I want my head_spinnin'
A fix that never misses
To get the highest high in the world
I take the girl, I take the girl
The saddest thing
And the saddest thing under the sun above,
Is to say_goodbye to the ones you love.
All the things that I have known
became my life my very own.
But before you know you say goodbye.
O----h, good time, goodbye
It's time to cry
but I will not weep nor make a scene
just say 'Thank you, life, for having been'
And the hardest thing under the sun above.
Is to say_goodbye to the ones you love.
No I will not weep nor make a scene
I'm gonna say 'Thank you, life for having been.'
And the loudest cry under the sun above
Is to silent goodbye from the ones you love.
A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music
used_to make me
smile
And I knew if I had my chance
that I could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me
shiver with every paper I'd
daliver
Bad news on the doorstap
I couldn't take one_more step
I can't remember if I cried
when I read about his
widowed bride
Something touched me
deep_inside the day the music
died.So bye_bye Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee
but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys
were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love and
do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rook and roll
can Music save your mortal soul and
can you teach me
how to dance real slow?
Well I know that
you're in love with him
cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shose
Man, I dig those rhythm and bluses
I was a lonely teenage
broncin's buck
with a pink_carnation
and a pickup_truck
But I knew I was out of luck
the day the music_died.
I started singing bye_bye
Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee
but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys
were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
Now for ten_years
we've_been on our own
and moss grows
fat on a rollin's stone
But that's not how it used_to be
When the Jester sang for the king
and Queen in a coat
He Borrowned from James Dean
and a voice that came
from you and me
Oh, and while the king
was looking down the Jester
stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned,
no verdict was returned
And while Lennin read a book on Marx
the coart took practice
in the park and we SONG
dirties in the dark
the day the music_died.
We were singin's_bye bye
Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee
but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys
were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
Helter-skelter in the summer
sweiter
the birds flew off
with a fall-out shelter
Eight miles high and fallin's fast,
it landed foul on
the gress
the players tried
for a forware pass,
with the Jester on the sidelines
in a coat
Now the half-time air
was sweet paerfume
While the sergeants
played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
but we never got the chance
Cause the players tried to
take the field,
the marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
the day the music_died
We started singin's_bye bye
Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee
but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys
were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
In there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space
with no time left to start
again
So come on, Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick
Jack sat on a candlestick
cause fire is the devils
only friend
(Oh) as I watched him on the stage,
my hands were clenched
in festive rage
No angel born in heaven
could break that stan's spell
And as the flames climbed
high into the night
the sacrificial rite I saw satan
Laughing with delight the day
the music_died.
He was singin's_bye bye
Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee
but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys
were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
I met girl
who sang the blues
and I asked her for
some happy news
but the just smiled and turned away
I went down to
the sacred store
where I heard the music years before
But the man there
said the music wouldn't play
The lovers cried
and the posts dreamed
(But) Not a word was spoken,
the church_bells all
were broken
And he three man
I admire most the Father,
Son an the holy Ghost
They caught the last train
for the coast
The day the music_died.
And they were singin' bye_bye
Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee
but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys
were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
they were singin' bye_bye
Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee
but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys
were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
I know that it might sound dumb
To say that you’re my number one
But I can’t seem to find a way
No other way for me to say
That you transcend my space and time
There really is no reason or rhyme
I just can’t seem to stay away
You light up my naïveté
Who_knows how many_times we’ll go around the sun
But all I know is that you’ll always be the one
Even_if you happen to leave me behind
I will always be yours and you will always be mine
‘Cause you are the love of my life
Even_though we sometimes fight
And I want you out of my sight
It only takes a sorry glance
To give each_other another chance
And one day we won’t be so young
We’ll try to remember how it once was
And I will trace the lines on your_face
And call you by your name
Who_knows how many_times we’ll go around the sun
But all I know is that you’ll always be the one
Even_if you happen to leave me behind
I will always be yours and you will always be mine
‘Cause you are the love of my life
We might kiss
we are alone
nobody's watching
might take it home
We might make out
when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate
So why do you fill
my sorrow
With the words
you've borrowed
From the only
place you've known
And why do sing Hallelujah
If it means
nothing to you
Why do you sing
with me at all
We might live
like never before
there's_nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more
We might make love
in some sacred place
The look on your_face
is delicate
So why do you fill
my sorrow
With the words
you've borrowed
From the only
place you've known
And why do sing Hallelujah
If it means
nothing to you
Why do you sing
with me at all
So why do you fill
my sorrow
With the words
you've borrowed
From the only
place you've known
why do sing Hallelujah
If it means
nothing to you
Why do you sing
with me at all
Last night we let the liquor_talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you
wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby_somethin's
tellin' me this ain't over_yet
No way it was our_last night
I kiss your_lips
Make you grip the sheets
with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' about life
goin' sip for sip, yeah
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake_up
wantin' you and me
I know that last_night
we let the liquor_talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish
I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby_somethin's tellin' me
this ain't over_yet
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
No way it was our_last night
(Last_night)
No way it was the last_night
that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You called your momma,
I call your bluff
In the middle_of the night,
pull her right back up
Yeah my, my friends say "Let her go"
Your friends say "What the hell?"
I wouldn't_trade your kind
of love for nothin' else
Oh baby,
last_night we let the liquor_talk
I can't remember everything
we said but we said it all
You told me that you
wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby_somethin's tellin' me
this ain't over_yet
No way it was our_last night,
we said we'd had enough
I can’t remember everything
we said but we said too_much
I know you packed your shit and
slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me
this ain’t over_yet
No way it was our_last night (Last_night)
No way it was our_last night (Last_night)
I know you said this time
you really weren’t comin' back again
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me
this ain’t over_yet
No way it was our_last night (Last_night)
No way it was our_last night (Last_night)
You may_not be home when I called
Maybe I was stoned when I called
Were you not alone when I called
Guess I hated that
I was just asleep when you called
Saw you in my dreams when you called
Should’ve left a note when you called
Would’ve called you back
I’m feeling underwhelmed with the heat of it
Should I stick_around try to reason with
How long’s it gonna last if we commit to work it out
[Chorus]
Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How_long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How_long do I keep photographs?
[Vеrse 2]
I’ve_been chasing both of our tails
No one did you wrong, I mеant well
So long_ago
Feel like giving in just for the hell of it
Keep you by my side cause you’re so relevant
I know you gave it all but we’ve got more to spend
Let’s stick it out
C’mon let me in cause I fix you up
While you’re looking outside I’ve got so_much love
Who’s to say what feels good now will still end up wrong
[Chorus]
Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How_long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How_long do I keep photographs?
Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How_long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How_long do I keep photographs?
Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How_long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How_long do I keep photographs?
Hold on
I’m over the moon about it
How_long till you break me in half?
Hold on
Was it over before it started?
How_long do I keep photographs?
Here's to all the late night
drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions
that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate
you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us
There's a_couple billion_people
in the world
And a million other_places
we could be but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and
every low led to this
I'm just so_glad you exist
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
Hey look what a hello
from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like
it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em
'cause you know me
better_than anyone else
We don't need anyone else
There's a_couple billion_people
in the world
And a million other_places
we could be but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and
every low led to this
I'm just so_glad you exist
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
Don't you ever go
don't you ever go
don't you ever go changing
Never let me go
never let me go
never let me go baby
Don't you ever go
don't you ever go
don't you ever go changing
Never let me go
never ever let me go
never let me go baby
There's a_couple billion_people
in the world
And a million other_places we could be
but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and
every low led to this
I'm just so_glad you exist
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
Ooh_ooh ooh_ooh ooh
Ooh I'm just so_glad you exist
They telephoned me just to say
That nobody had the time for yesterday
And all at once, I felt so small
Started feelin' like nobody cared at all
[Chorus]
But then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody_else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
Mm-mm, mm-mm
[Verse_2]
The people talk, it's background noise
I don't wanna hear nobody else's voice
There's somethin' sweet about your scent
It's like lavender came and never left
[Chorus]
And then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody_else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
Mm-mm
[Bridge]
Nothin' ever seemed to go right
All my days, they just fell into nights
Until I got a little_bit of you in my life
And then, suddenly, everything's bright
[Outro]
I know that there's a million different ways I could say
How you're always the best part_of my day
And when you feel the need to forget the world
You can call anytime you want, call anytime you want
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Hm
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder_if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter_after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't_call
but I lost all control
and I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin'_at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did_before
And I wonder_if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter_after one
I'm a little drunk
and I need you now
Said I wouldn't_call
but I lost all control
and I need you now
And I don't know
how I can do without
I just need you now
Yes I'd_rather hurt
than feel nothin' at all
It's a quarter_after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't_call
but I'm a little drunk
and I need you now
And I don't know
how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh baby I need you now
My addictive personality
Always gets the best of me
But like a train
that never stops
Falls off track with
the wheels still
spinning fast
Freedom of relationships
Are you really are
you all alone
I guess I’ll never know
Watch me go crazy
Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go
but don’t make me
My_ego won’t_save me
The city is crawling
with creeps
You’re loving men
much older than me
Why must you roll
your eyes
Subway games
will never die
Freedom of relationships
Are you really
are you all alone
I guess I’ll never know
Watch me go crazy
Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go
but don’t make me
My_ego won’t_save me
Watch me go crazy
Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go
but don’t make me
My_ego won’t_save me
Freedom of relationships
Are you really
are you all alone
I guess I’ll never know
Watch me go crazy
Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go
but don’t make me
My_ego won’t_save me
Watch me go crazy
Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go
but don’t make me
My_ego won’t_save me
Watch me go crazy
Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go
but don’t make me
My_ego won’t_save me
Watch me go crazy
Try to make you my lady
Gonna let go
but don’t make me
My_ego won’t_save me
Some_things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leavin'
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go
Like a runaway_Southbound train
Like an_Arizona desert_rain
Like_lightning in the sky
Like_fireworks in July
Like a left_field homerun_ball
Like a whiskey_shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going,_going, gone
I can say it wasn't_meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting_go
Change the way the river_flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind
Like a runaway_Southbound train
Like an_Arizona desert_rain
Like_lightning in the sky
Like_fireworks in July
Like a left_field homerun_ball
Like a whiskey_shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going,_going, gone
She ain't got one bit of stick_around
There's_no sense in tryin' to slow her down
Like a runaway_Southbound train
Like an_Arizona desert_rain
Like_lightning in the sky
Like_fireworks in July
Like a left_field homerun_ball
Like a whiskey_shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going,_going, gone
Going, going,_gone
Going, going,_gone
If i find him
If i just follow
Would he hold me and
never let me go
Woulf he let me borrow
his wool winter coat
I don't know I don't know
If i see her standing_there alone
At the tain station
three stops from home
I have half a mind to say
what i'm thinking anyway
But i don't know I don't know
There's an airpane in the sky
With a banner right behind
Loneliness is just a crime
Look each_other in the eye
And say hello-o-o-o-o
And say hello-o-o-o-o
hey there How you doing
Hi my name is Mary
Hi
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side
You've_been running and
hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride
Layla_you've got me on my knees
Layla I'm begging_darling please
Layla_darling won't you
ease my worried_mind
I tried to give you consolation
When your old_man had let you down
Like a fool I fell in love with you
Turned my whole_world upside_down
Layla_you've got me on my knees
Layla I'm begging_darling please
Layla_darling won't you
ease my worried_mind
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please_don't say
we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain
Layla_you've got me on my knees
Layla I'm begging_darling please
Layla_darling won't you
ease my worried_mind
Layla_you've got me on my knees
Layla I'm begging_darling please
Layla_darling won't you
ease my worried_mind
Layla_you've got me on my knees
Layla I'm begging_darling please
Layla_darling won't you
ease my worried_mind
Layla_you've got me on my knees
Layla I'm begging_darling please
Layla_darling won't you
ease my worried_mind

Ain't_nobody gonna_steal my love
If you want a lover
I'll do_anything you ask me to
And if you want another
kind_of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner
take my hand or
if you want to strike me
down in anger
here I stand
I'm your man
If you want a boxer
I will step
into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver
climb inside
Or if you want to
take me for a ride
you know you can
I'm your man
Ah the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've_been running through
these promises to you
that I made and I could not keep
I But a man never got a woman back
not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
and I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please please
I'm your man
And if you've_got to
sleep a moment on the road
I'll steer for you
And if you want to
work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father
for your child
or only want a
walk with me a while
across the sand
I'm your man
If you want a lover
I'll do_anything
that you ask me to
And If you want another
kind_of love
It's late in the evening
She's wondering what
clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
and brushed
her long_blonde hair
And then she_asks me
Do I look all right
And I say
Yes you look
Wonderful tonight
We go to a party
and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
who's walking
around with me
And then she_asks me
Do you feel all right
And I say
Yes I feel
Wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful
because I see the love
light In your eyes
And the wonder
of it all is that you
just don't realize
How much I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
so I give her the car_keys
She helps me to bed
and then I tell her
as I turn out the light
I say My darling
You are wonderful_tonight
Oh my darling you are
wonderful_tonight
I am not the kind_of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white_veil occasion
But you are not the kind_of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
This_is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run_away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single_vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Spеak now"
Fond gestures are еxchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It_seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?
Don't say yes, run_away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single_vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run_away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single_vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last_chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin'_at you
I am not the kind_of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white_veil occasion
But you are not the kind_of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha
So, don't say yes, run_away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single_vow
You need to hear me out
They said, "Speak now"
And you say
Let's run_away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now"
Especially for you
I wanna let you know
what I was going through
All the time we were apart
I thought of you
You were in my heart
My love never changed
I still feel the same
Especially for you
I wanna tell you
I was feeling that way too
And if dreams were wings you know
I would have flown to you
To be where you are
No_matter how far
And now that I'm next to you
No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow
I've got to say
It's all_because of you
And now we're back_together together
I wanna show you my heart is
oh so true
And all the love I have is
especailly for you
Especially for you
I wanna tell you you mean
all the world to me
How I'm certain that
our love was meant to be
You changed my life
You showed me the way
And now that I'm next to you
I've waited long_enough to find you
I wanna put all the hurt behind you
And i wanna bring out all the
love inside you oh
And now we're back_together together
I wanna show you my heart is
oh so true
And all the love I have is
especailly for you
You were in my heart
My love naver changed
And now that I'm next to you
No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow
I've got to say
It's all_because of you
And now we're back_together together
I wanna show you my heart is
oh so true
And all the love I have is
especailly for you
together together
I wanna show you my heart is
oh so true
And all the love I have is
especailly for you
You shake me up
and turn me upside_down
Just like a snow globe
And every_time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight
on a Christmas tree
Every_single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
Outside it's coming down
But here inside it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on
and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like
starlight on a Christmas tree
Every_single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
The winter is so gray
feels_like the ice is here to stay
But when you look_at me
you know you melt it all away
Every_single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way
you decorate my heart
Oh so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart
if you want to be my friend
you want us to get along
please do not expect me to
wrap it up and keep it there
the observation
I am doing could
easily be understood
as cynical demeanour
but one of us misread
what do you know
it happened again
a friend is not a means
you utilize to get somewhere
somehow didn't notice
friendship is an end
what do you know
it happened again
how come no_one told me
all throughout history
the loneliest people
were the ones who always
spoke their truth
the ones who made a
difference with standing
in difference
I guess it's up to me now
should I take that
risk or just smile
what do you know
it happened again
what do you know
I'd_rather dance with you
than talk with you
so why don't we just move into
the other room
There's space for us to shake
and hey I like this tune
Even_if I could hear what you said
I doubt my reply would be interesting
for you to hear
Because I haven't read a
single book all year
and the only film I saw
I didn't like it at all
I'd_rather dance I'd_rather dance
talk with you
I'd_rather dance I'd_rather dance
talk with you
I'd_rather dance I'd_rather dance
talk with you
The music's too loud
and the noise from the crowd
increases the chance
of misinterpretation
So let your hips do the talking
I'll make you laugh by acting
like the guy who sings
and you'll make me smile by really
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
getting into the swing
I'd_rather dance I'd_rather dance
talk with you
I'd_rather dance I'd_rather dance
talk with you
I'd_rather dance I'd_rather dance
talk with you
I'd_rather dance I'd_rather dance
talk with you
I'd_rather dance with you
I'd_rather dance with you
You can drink my liquor

I didn't wanna drop you off
I didn't wanna call it a night
I hope I didn't come across
Like I didn't wanna drink inside
I knew we had chemistry
And I knew it'd hit me sometime
But girl I didn't think the minute
That I pulled out of your drive
You'd make me wanna
U-turn this F150 right around
Whip a one-eighty on
back to your house
Be there in five, I'm betting
No way in hell I'm letting
You turn into the girl that got away
We said goodnight,
but I wanted to stay
I'm halfway home, girl,
it ain't too_late
Baby, hit me up and make me
make a U-turn,_U-turn, U-turn
A U-turn,_U-turn, U-turn
It's hard to keep it
'tween the lines
'Cause I keep picking up
my phone
And I hope there
ain't_no blue lights
Waiting_for me down the road
I keep on reaching across
the passenger seat
To see if you lost your lip
gloss or an earring
Anything I could_use
as a little excuse
To point the headlights
at what's in the rearview
And U-turn this F150
right around
Whip a one-eighty
on back to your house
Be there in five, I'm betting
No way in hell I'm letting
You turn into the girl
that got away
We said goodnight,
but I wanted to stay
I'm halfway home, girl,
it ain't too_late
Baby, hit me up and make me
make a U-turn,_U-turn, U-turn
A U-turn,_U-turn, U-turn
And baby ever since
I got to leaving
(ever since I got to leaving)
You know I been looking
for a reason, any reason
And U-turn this F150
right around
Whip a one-eighty
on back to your house
Be there in five, I'm betting
No way in hell I'm letting
You turn into the girl
that got away
We said goodnight,
but I wanted to stay
I'm halfway home, girl,
it ain't too_late
Baby, hit me up and make me
make a U-turn,_U-turn, U-turn
(Make me make a U-turn,
U-turn,_U-turn, baby)
A U-turn,_U-turn, U-turn
I didn't wanna drop you off
(U-turn, U-turn)
I didn't wanna call it a night
(U-turn, U-turn)
I wouldn't mind being alone
I wouldn't keep checking my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losing sleep
Remembering everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doing lately
You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go
If I didn't love you, I'd be good by now
I'd be better_than barely getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
I'd try to find someone_new (someone new)
It should be something I can do (I could do)
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go
If I didn't love you, I'd be good by now
I'd be better_than barely getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
Oh, if I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
There'll_be no strings
to bind your hands
Not if my love can't
bind your heart
And there's_no need to
take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Then slowly turn away_from me
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says
we've sinned
Well it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day
Of the years baby baby baby
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling
LYRICS:
Paradise is a swing on a porch
Summertime is a little too_short
The best things in life are free
And they’re always gonna be
Hometown is a heaven on earth
Sundays are for football and church
The world_turns but I believe
There’s always gonna be
Beer drinking kids on a backroad
Good_country songs on the radio
Tailgates falling down on a Friday
Long_goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long_as the sun keeps coming up
Long_as the Mississippi_River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
Girl your eyes are my favorite blue
I double-take when I wake_up with you
I’m so in love with you loving on me
And I’m always gonna be
Holding you close for the rest_of my life
Forever and ever baby just like
Beer drinking kids on a backroad
Good_country songs on the radio
Tailgates falling down on a Friday
Long_goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long_as the sun keeps coming up
Long_as the Mississippi_River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
Always gonna hold your hand
Always gonna ask you to dance
Even when we’re pushing 80
You’re still gonna drive me crazy
always gonna be
Beer drinking kids on a backroad
Good_country songs on the radio
Tailgates falling down on a Friday
Long_goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long_as the sun keeps coming up
Long_as the Mississippi_River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
Baby when I met you
there was peace unknown
I set out to get you
with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me
that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
needs no conversation
We ride it together huhn huh
Making love with each_other huhn_hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely_on each_other huhn_hah
From one lover to another huhn_hah
I can't live_without you
if the love was gone
Everything is nothing
if you got no_one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us
and we got no_doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together huhn_hah
Making love with each_other huhn_hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely_on each_other huhn_hah
From one lover to another huhn_hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely_on each_other huhn_hah
From one lover to another huhn_hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely_on each_other huhn_hah
From one lover to another huhn_hah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between

It’s hard to put a finger on exactly what you do
But you got me in my feelings, and that ain’t something I’m used_to
I don’t mind, I kinda like it, don’t need nothin’ new
You can just keep doin’ what you do
There’s_something ’bout the way that you’re lookin’ at me
There’s_something ’bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it’s the way I get lost in your eyes
But I can see forever when you give me that smile
There’s_something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)
There’s_something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)
You being you, babe
It sure gets me in the mood, babe
Why you gotta be so smooth, babe?
It’s so rude, babe
And I just can’t get me enough
There’s_something ’bout the way that you’re lookin’ at me
There’s_something ’bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it’s the way I get lost in your eyes
But I can see forever when you give me that smile
There’s_something ’bout you, there’s_something ’bout me
There’s_something ’bout us, boy, it’s something_’bout we
There’s_something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)
Ooh, there’s_something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)
Ain’t nothing I would change
Nobody could take your place
There’s_something ’bout the way that you’re lookin’ at me
There’s_something ’bout the way that you look in that t-shirt (Ooh)
Maybe it’s the way I get lost in your eyes
Yeah, I can see forever when you give me that smile
There’s_something ’bout you, there’s_something ’bout me
There’s_something ’bout us, boy, it’s something_’bout we (Boy, it’s something_’bout we)
There’s_something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, yeah, there’s_something ’bout you (Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, boy, there’s_something ’bout you
There’s just something_’bout you
Yeah, boy, there’s_something ’bout you
I was falling into a hole
I knew_it, I had fallen in before
I didn't have the tools or understand the rules to be more
[Pre-Chorus]
I allow myself to see
The truth of how it came to be
Fists uncurl, anger leaves
From the dirt, come_back free
[Chorus]
Oh you can come_back free, you can come_back free
Yeah you can come_back free, you can come_back free
[Verse_2]
I was lost inside a dream
I knew_it, I had been in there before
I'm twisting and I'm turning
Taking my time, welcoming my fears through the door
[Pre-Chorus]
I know that now I can see
The truth of how it came to be
Fists uncurl, anger leaves
From the dirt, come_back free
[Chorus]
Oh you can come_back free, you can come_back free
Yeah you can come_back free, you can come_back free
[Bridge]
Made it high in a backward glance
In the moving rain on my way to see clearer
Staring_at my fears in the back
In the rear vision mirror
Down the road I pull over
Jump into the river
Close my eyes on the bank I see all that I need to
I'm alive I know that and I'm thanking the teacher
I'm alive I know that and I'm thanking the teacher
[Chorus]
Oh you can come_back free, you can come_back free
Yeah you can come_back free, you can come_back free
[Outro]
All of the strength of the fire I've come to borrow
I am holding the weight in the night
Who_knows tomorrow
It would be so easy, babe
To come and say I love you and
Pretend that this was
all just a bad dream
We would dance a waltz around
Make a big smile right at the camera
Pretend that things are
easy as they seem
But there's a crack
that's running through my heart
I never knew that it was crystal
That our love could be so brittle
But it's looking
Like it's gonna fall_apart
And it was so nice baby
But I'm afraid, I'm taking back my heart
We never wanted this to end
And it's so hard to understand
When something
that you love just disappears
We've been grasping at a shadow
Filled the void by talking louder
Pretended the voice inside was
just a fear
But I feel like
the curtain is coming down
And I think there's_no surprise
Cause we've_been knowing it for a while
And I’d wish
we could go back to the start
And it was so nice baby
But I'm afraid, I'm taking back my heart
But there's a crack
that's running through my heart
I never knew that it was crystal
That our love could be so brittle
But it's looking
Like it's gonna fall_apart
And it was so nice baby
But I'm afraid, I'm taking back my heart
There's traffic in the sky
and it doesn't seem to be getting much better
there's kids playing games on the pavement
drawing waves on the pavement
shadows of the planes on the pavement
it's enough to make me cry
but that don't seem like it would
make it feel better
maybe it's a dream and if I scream
it will burst at the seams
this whole_place will fall_into pieces
and then they'd say...
Well how could I have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
if you keep adding stones
soon the water will be lost in the well
Puzzle pieces in the ground
But no_one ever seems to be digging
instead they're looking up
towards the heavens
it's enough to make me cry
but that don't seem like it would
make it feel better
the answers could be found
we could learn from digging down
but no_one ever seems to be digging
instead they'll say...
Well how could I have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
if you keep adding stones
soon the water will be lost in the well
Words of wisdom all around
but no_one ever seems to listen
they're talking about their plans on the paper
building up frm the pabement
there are shadows from the skyscrapers
on the pavement
it's enough to make me sigh
but that don't seem like it would
make it feel better
the words are all around
but the words are only sounds
and no on ever seems to listen
instead they'll say...
Well how could I have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
if you keep adding stones
soon the water will be lost in the well
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very_first night
And so it goes
Every weekend the same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know
about the night in the hotel
We were riding
in the car when we_both fell
Didn't leave a note
in the Polaroid picture
They don't know how_much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very_first night
And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back_then we didn't know
We were built to fall_apart
We broke the status quo
And we broke each_other's hearts
But don't forget
about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen
chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about
the words that we whisper
No one knows how_much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very_first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
I remember
the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car
when we_both fell
whisper
Do you know how_much I miss you
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
I miss like you it was the first_time
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up
and we'd go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it
was the very_first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
It's not time to make a change
Just relax take it easy
You're_still young that's your fault
There's so_much you have to know
Find a girl settle_down
If you want you can marry
Look_at me I am old
But I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on
But take your time think a lot
Think of everything you've_got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may_not
How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same_old story
From the moment
I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away
I know I have to go
It's not time to make a change
Just sit down and take it slowly
You're_still young that's your fault
There's so_much
you have to go through
Find a girl settle_down
If you want you can marry
Look_at me I am old
But I'm happy
All the times that I've cried
Keeping all the things I know inside
And it's hard but it's harder
To ignore it
If they were right I'd agree
But it's them they know not me
Now there's a way and I know
I have to go away
I know I have to go
I wake_up with the biggest smile
I take the longest and deepest breath
I watch the dusts dance in the sun ray
Peeking through my slightly open curtain
I open my window and smell the morning
While listening to the neighbors birds sing
I let the godly light touch my face
I let myself fall for its embrace
You’re on my right
Then you hold me tight
I am thereupon sent to the heavens
So this is what it feels_like
To love and then be loved back
I keep believing it’s gonna happen
Replaying it over and over again
I keep it dearly, close to my chest
Though sometimes it feels_like I need a rest
‘Cause you’re not by my side
You’re not holding me tight
I don’t have my favorite sight
And this is what it feels_like
To love and not be loved back
I’m just daydreaming
I’m sitting in bed believing it’s early morning
Not 11 AM as I am
Dreading to get up
Finding reasons to keep going
I'd_rather be a sparrow than a snail.
나는 달팽이가 되기보다는 차라리 참새가 될래요
Yes I would.If I could,
그래 그럴거야 만약 가능하다면,
I surely would. Hm hm..
꼭 그럴거야 흠 흠..
I'd_rather be a hammer than a nail.

If I only could,
만약 가능하다면,
I surely would.
꼭 그럴거야
Away, I'd_rather sail_away
멀리 나는 멀리 떠나고 싶다
Like a swan that's here and gone
백조처럼 여기에 있다 가버린...
A man gets tied up to the ground
사람은 땅에 얽매여
He gives the world
세상에서
Its saddest sound,
가장 슬픈 소리를 낸다네
Its saddest sound.
가장 슬픈 소리를 낸다네
I'd_rather be a forest than a street.
나는 길이 되기 보다는 차라리 숲이 되고 싶다.
Yes I would.
응 그럴거야.
If I could,
만약 가능하다면,
I surely would.
꼭 그럴거야.
I'd_rather feel the earth beneath my feet,
나의 발의 바로 밑에 있는 땅을 느끼고 싶다,
Yes I would.
응 그럴거야.
If I only could,
만약 가능하다면,
I surely would.
꼭 그럴거야.
Away, I'd_rather sail_away

A man gets tied up to the ground

Its saddest sound.
가장 슬픈 소리를 낸다네
Hm hm..
흠 흠...
April come she will
When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June she'll change her tune
In_restless walks
she'll prowl the night
July she will fly
And give no warning
to her flight
August die she must
The autumn winds blow
chilly and cold
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old
And the city's eyes just wonder
Where you're headed to
I'll find my way to you
Oh you look_at me
while I look in your eyes
I'll try my best to make you crack a smile
And we can get away_from here
Yeah we can get away_from here girl
I want to tell you
but I can't seem to get it to you
I want to love you
but I just can't give it to you
Baby tell me what can I do
When I can't_help
but fall in love with you doorudoonu
I know it's you
And the city's eyes just wonder
If we were meant to be
If you were meant for me
Just close your eyes and
live like you're free then you'll see
That time is just a remedy for
Nothing but sweet love
For nothing but our love girl
I want to tell you
but I can't seem to get it to you
I want to love you
but I just can't give it to you
Baby tell me what can I do
When I can't_help
but fall in love with you doorudoonu
I know it's you
I want to tell you
but it might lead to disaster
I want to love you
but I'm scared of what will happen after
Baby tell me what's left to do
when I can't_help but fall in love with you
I want to tell you
but I can't seem to get it to you
I want to love you
but I just can't give it to you
Baby tell me what can I do
When I can't_help
but fall in love with you doorudoonu woo
I know it's you
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've_been running and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.
Layla, you've_got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling_won't you ease my worried mind.
I tried to give you consolation
When your old_man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
Turned my whole_world upside down.
Chorus
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane.
Please_don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain.
Chorus
Chorus
Don't you worry_about me
Time is over let me free
Flying in to the sky
Maybe I should know why
Dreams are not so far behind
Don't you worry_about me
I will go where life leads me
I will be so strong
The autumn wind has gone
And still the days go on and on
Don't you worry_about me
You will never find a girl like me
There_is no_one else
No_matter what you search
What you'll get will be a mess
do I do I do I do
do I do I do I
baby don't you think it's true
Don't you worry_about me
Time is over let me free
Flying in to the sky
Maybe I should know why
Dreams are not so far behind
Don't you worry_about me
I can run in NY's streets
Singing in to the sun
Laughts and smile enough
Drink something like a superstar
do I do I do I do
do I do I do I
baby don't you think it's true
If there is a way
I'll find it someday
I start to play a a a a
If there is a way
To make me sway
do I do I do I do
do I do I do I baby
don't you think it's true
Try to remember the kind_of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind_of September
When grass was green
and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind_of September
When you were a tender
and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow,_follow
Try to remember
when life was so_tender
That no_one wept except the willow
Try to remember the time of September
When love was an ember
about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow,_follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
The fire of September
that made us mellow
Deep in December our hearts
should remember
And follow, follow,_follow
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is
floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair
like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be_surprised
It happens_every time
It's nothin' new
It's always on a night
like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
'Cause when you look_at me
with those eyes
I'm_speechless
Starin'_at you standin'_there
in that dress
What it's doin' to me
ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know
that you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've_been in a daze
Ever_since the day that we met
You take the breath out
of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words
out of my mouth
without even tryin'
And I'm_speechless
Starin'_at you standin'_there
in that dress
What it's doin' to me
ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know
that you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
Yeah baby mmm
It's always on a night
like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
'Cause when you look_at me
with those eyes
I'm_speechless
You standin'_there in that dress
Girl it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is
all that I can do
Oh I'm_speechless
You already_know
that you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
Oh you know it baby
Tell me why would the dark
put a smile on your_face
Guess I know how
Cause you do love to keep
all your secrets
Maybe that’s odd
but your demons will chase you
I cannot say so but oh
I don’t know why they should though
You possibly can’t use it
But you know that
Cowboys like quite shows
And the maker of that show
you know you know you know
In a way you did know
There was no luck involved
But still you think so
You have no idea
what you wish for
Maybe we’re all gonna
miss what you gave us
Maybe you’ll hate us
But how should we know
who is to be trusted
You possibly can’t use it
But you know that
Cowboys like quite shows
And the maker of that show
you know you know you know

I'm so bored of being sick
But it helps me breathe
when I'm alone like a tree
Doctors run come help me quick
I don't know what it is
But there is something wrong with me
Give me more
I'm sorry now about it
Give me more
I'm more_than that
I've got blood and I've got love
I'm so damn happy to be awake
Shape me up with pills to take
Tell me why the bellyache
Give me more
I'm sorry now about it
Give me more
I'm brokеn down forget it
I'd like to be morе and
I want an orange tree
If in ten days I'm not dead
I will get on out and use my legs
Run myself a clear green bath
Keep the good_times rolling
And that my friends is that
All of my friends
Finally convinced
Me to get out of the house
To help me forget
To help me move on
Then I heard you're back in town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me
that you were coming
So
I should_probably go to bed
I should_probably
turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should_probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning
I'll be calling
Saying sorry for the things I said
So I should_probably go to bed
So I don't undo
The got over you
That it took so long to find
'Cause all it would take
Is seeing your_face
And I'd forget
I should_probably go to bed
I should_probably
turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should_probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning
I'll be calling
Saying sorry for the things I said
So I should_probably go to bed
Before I question my decision
Is it love I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know I don't
Have the self control
To walk_away if you walk in
I know I should_probably go to bed
I'm all up in my head
I should go to bed
I'm all up in my head
I should go to bed
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me
that you were comin'
So I should_probably go to bed
Said some things I ain't proud of
I wish I could take back
Never meant to make you
hurt like that no
For a while it was perfect
You made my world standstill
Oh and something
about you always will
So when it's late at night
and you're still wide_awake
If you're with your friends
or you're lonely
When you hear somebody
start to say my name
Oh when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you
Picture that night in Portland
We drank three bottles of wine
I said I love you
'bout a million_times
And then we drove to Seattle
And just to kiss in the rain
Now when it's pourin'
do you see my face
So when it's late at night
and you're still wide_awake
If you're with your friends
or you're lonely You're lonely
When you hear somebody start
to say my name
Oh when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you think
think good things
I hope you
Think of the way
that I started to shake
when I held you
for the first_time
And every kiss that our lips
made feel like New Year's Eve
at midnight
Think of the 3AM conversations
all of the big dreams
that we were chasin' down
And if I ever cross
your mind somehow
When it's late at night
and you're still wide_awake
If you're with your friends
or you're lonely
When you hear somebody
start to say my name
Oh when you think of me
I hope you think good things
Some days her shape in the
doorway
Will speak to me
A bird's wing on the window
Sometimes I'll hear her when
she's sleeping
Her fever dream
A language on her face
I want your flowers like babies
want God's love
Or_maybe as sure as tomorrow
will come
Some days like rain on the
doorstep
She'll cover me
With grace in all she offers
Sometimes I'd like to just to
ask her
What honest words
She can't afford to say like
I want your flowers like babies
want God's love
Or_maybe as sure as tomorrow
will come
I'm gonna pick_up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong
we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one_thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold_December
but I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken
I'll mend you and keep
you sheltered from the storm
that's_raging on now
I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up
when you're getting down
And out of all these_things
I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things
I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it
and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
but I've_been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up
when you're getting down
And out of all these_things
I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things
I've_done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and
it's more_than I can take
And it's dark in a cold_December
but I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken
I'll mend you and keep
you sheltered from the storm
that's_raging on now
I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up
when you're getting down
And out of all these_things
I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things
I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up
when you're getting down
And out of all these_things
I've_done
I will love you better now
open your eyes
and tell me what's on your mind
have you been feeling alright
or are you in need of time
some days are hard
but with time we can find ourselves
I'll be here if you need my help
just free the words from your mouth
and this time I'm not that scared
to face life when you're not there
oh
I know you're tired
of being alone again
just know you're desired
even if you don't feel it now and then
change is hard
with a broken_heart in your way
you didn't deal your cards
so don't let_them decide your fate
love
my love
my love
my love
last_night I had a dream you
moved on from me
I cried to my fears and
begged them
for the mercy you won't leave
for the days I knew
I couldn't breathe on my own
you held onto my hands and
pulled down my sleeves
just to keep me warm
and this time I'm not that scared
to face life when you're not there
oh
I know you're tired
of being alone again
just know you're desired
even if you don't
feel it now and then
change is hard
with a broken_heart in your way
you didn't deal your cards
so don't let_them decide your fate
you're_doing great
we'll brave the day
I need you to say
you're going to stay
love
my love
my love
my love
I followed you into traffic
I never thought about asking
What we were going to do
When we got
where we wanted to get to
I'm slipping into an accent
it's almost more_than a habit
What are we gonna do
When I can't talk
can't talk straight at you
I remember everything you said
All about how it is
just the way that it is
But I think that what you
really meant to say is
Baby I don't know if I can
Stop this oh I can't stop this
High times that's right red
white black and blue
Nobody_has it better_than you
Winning in a landslide
a high tide running out of room
Nobody got there faster_than you
Nobody_has it better_than you
better_than you bettеr than you
Nobody_has it better_than you
bettеr than you better_than you
I can't deny that I've had it
It's just a sweet little sadness
And yeah I've felt it before
But it's nothing much
compared to yours
So fundamentally toxic
You know it wasn't your fault then
There's so_much we can't hold
Oh you know
you were just a little boy
I remember everything you said
All about how it is just
the way that it is
But I think that what you really
meant to say is
Baby I don't know if I can
Stop this oh I can't stop this
High times that's right red
white black and blue
Nobody_has it better_than you
Winning in a landslide
a high tide running out of room
Nobody got there faster_than you
Nobody_has it better_than you
better_than you better_than you
Nobody_has it better_than you
better_than you better_than you
Well it's easy for you to say
Standing there
with your future all aligned
But it isn't for you to say
When you get off easy every_time
Oh it's easy for you to say
Standing there
with your future all aligned
But it isn't for you to say
When you get off easy every_time
Easy every_time easy every_time
With your high times
that's right red white
black and blue
High times that's right red
white black and blue
Nobody_has it better_than you
Nobody_has it better_than you
better_than you better_than you
Nobody_has it better_than you
better_than you better_than you

Oh, where the time_goes?
La_La La_La
Who Knows where the time_goes?
La_La La_La
Oh, where the time_goes?
La_La La_La
All those days that I knew
Rolling back beyond the schmooze
Of that smoke filled back room
Where I was waiting_for tomorrow
When your eyes lit up green
Atoned for how things should have been
Pulled the wool from my seams
While I was waiting_for tomorrow
Step_back is this the moonlight?
Step_back is this the moonlight?
Or
Is there just something about_you?
Is there just something about_you?
Is there just something about_you?
Is there just something about_you?
Who Knows where the time_goes?
La_La La_La
Oh, where the time_goes?
La_La La_La
Oh those days that I knew
Rolling back beyond the blues
Of that old late night tune
I was waiting_for tomorrow
Step_back is this the moonlight?
Step_back is this the moonlight?
Or
Is there just something about_you?
Is there just something about_you?
Step_back is this the moonlight?
Step_back is this the moonlight?
Or
Is there just something about_you?
Is there just something about_you?
Is there just something about_you?

Tell me somethin' girl
Are you happy
in this modern world
Or do you need more
Is there somethin'
else you're searchin' for
I'm fallin'
In all the good_times
I find myself longin' for change
And in the bad times I fear myself
Tell me something boy
Aren't you tired
tryin' to fill that void
Or do you need more
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore
I'm falling
In all the good_times
I find myself longin' for change
And in the bad times I fear myself
I'm off the deep_end
Watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they can't hurt us
We're_far from the shallow_now
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're_far from the shallow_now
I'm off the deep_end
Watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they can't hurt us
We're_far from the shallow_now
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're_far from the shallow_now
Tell me somethin' boy
Tell me somethin' girl
Yeah
we're far_from the shallow
Yeah
we're far_from the shallow_now
We're_far from the shallow_now
When I’m alone in silence
It ain’t really quiet
‘Cause in my head there’s sirens
When you’re not there
Name it and I’ve tried it
It only amplified it
But with you on Orcas Island
It’s quiet there
The noise it don’t sound
like it use to
I can smell that lavender perfume
Nothing calms me down quite
like you do
And I’m spinning out
When I’m alone in silence
It ain’t really quiet
‘Cause in my head there’s sirens
When you’re not there
Name it and I’ve tried it
It only amplified it
But with you on Orcas Island
It’s quiet there quiet there
Won’t wait around
for another burn out
I’ve_been there before I know
how it turns out
I’ve seen what’s to see here
the air ain’t no sweeter
Hold me ‘cause I’m spinning out
When I’m alone in silence
It ain’t really quiet
‘Cause in my head there’s sirens
When you’re not there
Name it and I’ve tried it
It only amplified it
But with you on Orcas Island
It’s quiet there quiet there
You take it or you leave it
So I guess that I’m leaving
And if you can hear me
Meet me there
You take it or you leave it
So I guess that I’m leaving
And if you can hear me
Meet me there
When I’m alone in silence
It ain’t really quiet
‘Cause in my head there’s sirens
When you’re not there
Name it and I’ve tried it
It only amplified it
But with you on Orcas Island
It’s quiet there quiet there
I've_been oversleeping so_much
that I've_been bored of dreaming
And just wake up, not next to you
In this paper town where I live,
boxes pass along and I wish
That I was sitting in one with you
With you
I will be your friend,
but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way,
just thought_I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour,
if you'll have me, I want you
You've_been overthinking
so much,
the traffic in your head
Oh, they rush at the thought
of someone_new
Laurеn, why can't you accept it?
I love you
and I'm not pretеnding
when I say those words to you
I will be your friend,
but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way,
just thought_I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour,
if you'll have me, I want you Lo
If I learn to love myself,
will it keep you
from loving someone else?
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know
If learning to love
would cost my life,
I'd spend it all on you and I
I will be your friend,
but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way,
just thought_I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour,
if you'll have me, I want you
I learned the truth
at seventeen
That love was ment
for beauty queens
And high school
girls
With clear skinned
smiles
Who married young
and then retired
The valentines
I never knew
The friday night
charades of youth
Were spent on
one_more beautiful
At seventeen
I learned the truth
And those of us
with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social
graces desperately
Remained at home
inventing lovers
On the phone
who called to say
Come dance with me
and murmured
Vague obscenities
it isn't all it seems
At seventeen
a brown eyed_girl
In hand me downs
whose name
I never could
pronounce
Said pity
please the ones
Who serve
they only get
What they deserve
and the rich
Relationed hometown
queen
Marries into
what she needs
With a guarantee
of company
And haven
for the elderly
Remember those
who win the game
Lose the love
they sought to gain
In debentures
of quality
And dubious
integrity
Their small_town eyes
will gape at you
In dull surprise
when payment due
Exceeds accounts
received at seventeen
To those of us
who knew the pain
Of valentines
that never came
And those whose names
were never called
When choosing side
for basketball
It_was long_ago
and far_away
The world was younger
than today
When dreams were
all they gave for free
To ugly duckling
girls like me
We all play the game
and when we dare
We cheat ourselves
at solitaire
Inventing lovers
on the phone
Repenting other
lives unknown
That call and say
come dance with me
And murmur vague
obscenities
At ugly girls like me
at seventeen
Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an_hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first_time ever hangin' out with you tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost_town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
I've_been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every_time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used_to no_one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost_town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost_town up with life (Life)
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
Lady weepinng at the crossroads
Would you meet your love
In the twilight
with his greyhounds
And the hawk upon his glove
Bribe the birds
then on the branches
Bribe them to be dumb
Stare the hot sun out of heaven
That the night may come
Starless are the nights of travel
Bleak the winter wind
Run with terror all before you
And regret behind
Run until you hear the ocean`s
Everlasting cry
Deep though it may be and bitter
You must drink it dry
drink it dry
Wear out patience in the lowest
Dungeons of the sea
Searching through
the stranded shipwrecks
For the golden key
Push on to the world`s end
pay the
Dread guard with a kiss
Cross the rotten bridge
that totters
Over the abyss
There stands the deserted castle
Ready to explore
Enter climb the marble staircase
Open the locked door
Cross the silent empty ballroom
Doubt and anger past
Blow the cobwebs from the mirror
See yourself at last
See yourself at last
Put your hand behind the wainscot
You have done your part
Find the penknife there
and plunge it
Into your false heart
Here we go, come with me
There`s a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
Close with you here, I`m a rocketeer
Let`s_fly Fly_fly fly_fly
Up here we go
Or Let`s_fly Fly_fly fly_fly
Where we go, we don`t_need roads
Where we stop nobody knows
To the stars if you really want
Got a jetpack with name on it
Above the clouds and the atmosphere
Say the words and we outta here
Hold my hand if you feelin scared
flyin` up, flyin` outta here
Here we go, come with me
There`s a world out there that we should see
Up here we go
Take my hand
Here we go
Up take my hand
Close with you here, I`m a rocketeer
Let`s_fly Fly_fly fly_fly
Up here we go
Or Let`s_fly Fly_fly fly_fly
We can stay fly like a G6
Shop the streets of Tokyo
Boy, You, your always on my mind
Got my head up in the sky

On some next level, super mario
Hope this works out, cardio
Until then let`s fly
Geronimo
Here we go, come with me
There`s a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
Close with you here, I`m a rocketeer
Let`s_fly (Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up here we go
Or Let`s_fly Fly_fly fly_fly
Let`s_fly Fly_fly fly_fly
Up here we go
Or Let`s_fly Fly_fly fly_fly
Puff the magic_dragon
lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist
in a land_called Hanalee
Little Jackie_Paper
loved that rascal Puff
and brought him strings
and sealing wax
and other fancy stuff
Oh Puff the magic_dragon
lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist
in a land_called Hanalee
Puff the magic_dragon
lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist
in a land_called Hanalee
together they would travel
on a boat with billowed sails
Jackie kept a lookout perched
on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princess
would bow when there they came
Pirate ships would lower
their flads when Puff
roared out his name
Oh Puff the magic_dragon
lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist
in a land_called Hanalee
Puff the magic_dragon
lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist
in a land_called Hanalee
A dragon lives forever
but not so little boys
Painted wings and giants rings
make way for other toys
One gray night it happened
Jackie_Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon
he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow
Grief scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
along the cherry lane
Without his life long friend
Puff could not be_brave
So Puff that mighty dragon
sadly slipped into his cave
Oh Puff the magic_dragon
lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist
in a land_called Hanalee
Puff the magic_dragon
lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist
in a land_called Hanalee
Sunshine on my shoulders
makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always make me high
If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you a day just like today
If I had a song that
I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to
make you feel this way
Sunshine on my shoulders
makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always make me high
If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that
I could wish for you
I'd make a wish
for sunshine all the while
Sunshine on my shoulders
makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
Sunshine almost all the time
makes me high
Sunshine almost always
When all that you`ve tried
leaves nothing but holes inside
It_seems like you`re wired to stay_here held in time
Cuz nothing seems to change oh no.
No nothing`s gonna change at all.
I can see it in your_face the hope has gone away.
If you hold tight shadows will be lost in the light.
Oh cuz sometimes fate and your dreams will collide.
So don`t walk_away from me
Don`t walk_away from me
Don`t walk_away from me. yeah
Your feet are stuck no they cannot move
Don`t tell me that they`re glued
Sure they`re far from.
At home at ease but give sometime to breathe
Cuz nothing seems to change oh no.
No nothing`s gonna change at all.
I can see it in your_face the hope has gone away.
But if we hold tight
shadows will be lost in the light.
Oh cuz sometimes fate and your dreams will collide.
So don`t walk_away from me
Don`t walk_away from me
Don`t walk_away from me oh
Cuz everthing will be ok
I know that it`s so easy to say
But the pain inside will fade
Please_tell me that you`ll stay.
If we hold tight shadows will be lost in the light.
Cuz sometimes fate and your dreams will collide.
When all that you`ve tried
leaves nothing but holes inside
Verse_1
You said you wanted me forever, never met_someone like you
Said we'd always be together, yeah, you promised me the moon
No, there_ain't much we can say we didn't do
You took almost everything I had to lose
Chorus
You were my first kiss, first love
First drink, first drunk
First pickup_truck where I said that I loved you
First on my skin, well, I almost did
Thank_God I never went with you
Thank_God we never got_tattoos
Verse_2
Yeah, you made me reckless, made me wanna do the things I'd never do
Something stupid, just to prove it, something now we can't undo
Yeah, you even called some shady place downtown
Kind of crazy when I think_about it now
Chorus
You were my first kiss, first love
First drink, first drunk
First pickup_truck where I said that I loved you
First on my skin, well, I almost did
Thank_God I never went with you
Thank_God we never got_tattoos
Mmm, thank_God we never got_tattoos
Mmm
Bridge
Thank_God you broke my heart in
That one-bedroom apartment
Thank_God I never went with you
Thank_God we never got_tattoos
Thank_God I learned my lesson
I wish I never met you
Thank_God the first ain't with you
Thank_God we never got_tattoos
Chorus
You were my first kiss, first love
First drink, first drunk
First pickup_truck where I said that I loved you
First on my skin, well, I almost did
Thank_God I never went with you
Thank_God we never got_tattoos
Mmm, thank_God we never got_tattoos
Mmm, thank_God we never got_tattoos
"You're so pretty"
I say that to a random girl in the bathroom
I forgive my stupid exes like I have to
Text my friends just to say, "I'm checkin' on you"
[Pre-Chorus]
What it must be like to be
On the other_side of me
Always smilin' nice and sweet
Deep down in reality
[Chorus]
I hate the way "self-love" sounds
I hate that I need some right_now
I hate this dumb self-love song
'Cause I'm the only one, I don't let my
Self_love
Self_love
[Verse_2]
I was supposed to write out ten things I like about me, I
Only got to three, what doеs that say about therapy? I
Posted a caption sayin' "treat yoursеlf nice"
For the life of me, I can't seem to take my own advice
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what it must be like to be
Thrivin' in high self-esteem
Confidence is so mainstream
Maybe it's just not for me
[Chorus]
I hate the way "self-love" sounds
I hate that I need some right_now
I hate this dumb self-love song (Self-love song)
'Cause I'm the only one, I don't let my
Self_love
Self_love
Self_love
La-da-da
Self_love
[Bridge]
What it must be like to be
Anybody else but me
[Chorus]
I hate the way "self-love" sounds
I hate that I need some right_now
I hate this dumb self-love song (Self-love song)
'Cause I'm the only one, I don't let my
Self_love
It's so dumb
Self_love
I'm the only one, I don't let my
Self_love
Self_love
I've made up my mind
To get tangled_up with you
Even_though I'm undeserving
More_than the sunshine
Up in the great_big blue
You satisfy my every yearning
You're like an arrow out of nowhere
You hit the center of my heart
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you
Always need you ohhhh yeahh
Now that I'm here
Everyday is new
I'm not going to look any longer
It's all so clear
Everything pales to you
Oh your love just makes me stronger
Like a shadow tied to your heel
I'll follow wherever you go
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you
I wanna climb to the top
of a hill somewhere
And scream at the top of my lungs
The rain may come but I don't_care
I'm gonna keep tellin' everyone that
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you
And I will always need you
Always need you ohhhh yeahh
I love you just the way God_made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call?your?imperfections

Tell em Blanc
The way your hair’s?in a mess
in the morning
when you open your eyes
The way an_hour goes by

of your smile when you're laughing
at a movie that you’ve seen
about a thousand times

Yeah, hey, I can feel your presence
from a mile away (Mile away)
Catch a flight to Carolina
just to get a taste
Getting busy in my pickup
on a sunny_day
Ms. Perfect when you work it,
you don't make mistakes
One time for my baby
in the knee-highs
How you fit all of that ass
in them Levi's?
Two time, but I need it
more_than two times
You don’t even gotta try
I love you just the way God_made you
Girl, He don’t make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it, too
’Cause I was made for loving

Just the way God_made you
So_many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting_for someone
To sing me his song
So_many dreams
I've kept deep_inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, "Hey, I love you,"
Never again
To be all alone
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life
I'd_rather be
a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would
if I could
I surely would
I'd_rather be
a hammer than a nail
Yes I would
if I only could
I surely would
Away I'd_rather sail_away
Like a swan
that's here and gone
A man gets tied up
to the ground
He gives the world
its saddest sound
Its saddest sound
I'd_rather be
a forest than a street
Yes I would
if I could
I surely would
I'd_rather feel
the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would
if I only could
I surely would
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I can't fight it any more
And I wonder_if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter_after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't_call but I lost
all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do
without I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey
can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
in the way you did_before
And I wonder_if I ever
cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter_after one
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't_call but I lost
all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do
without I just need you now
Yes I'd_rather hurt than
feel nothing at all
It's a quarter_after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't_call
but I'm a little drunk
and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do
without I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh baby I need you now
We're walkin' like in the Dolce_Vita
This time we got it right
We're livin' like in the Dolce_Vita
Mmm gonna drink tonight
We're dancin' like in a Dolce_Vita
With the lights and music on
Our love is made in a Dolce_Vita
Nobody_else than you
It's our_last night
Together with our love again
Another light
Before we're thrown in darkness
Say you'll_never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me now
We made it down in the Dolce_Vita
Wipe all your fears away
We live like in Dolce_Vita
Our game of yesterday
I'm so alone in the Dolce_Vita
Oh baby telephone
This magic is gone in the Dolce_Vita
Nobody_else than you
It's our_last night
Together with our love again
Another night
Before we're thrown in darkness
Say you'll_never leave me now
Oh say you're gonna love me now
It's our_last night
Together with our love again
Another light
Before we're thrown in darkness
So say you'll_never leave me now
Oh say you're gonna love me now
Just say you're gonna love me now
Just say it again
Just say it again
When the rain is blowin' in your_face
And the whole_world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening
shadows and the stars appear
And there is no
one there to dry your tears
I could hold you
for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made
your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the
moment that we met
No doubt in my mind
where you belong
I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
No there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging
on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regrets
The winds of change
are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothin' like me yet
I could make you happy
make your dreams come_true
There's_nothing that
I would not do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
Think my heart might just run out my love
If we fight for another day
I used_to be something you wanted
But It's different
We're different because now when
You tell me you need me
I walk_away bleeding and
Now I can see that
I'm on my own
How's this love when
I'm left with nothing
You take what you need and run
Cold and numb when
You up and leave me
You take what you need and run
When your heart is running out my love
Do you always run_away
I know that you used_to feel something
But it's different
We're different because now when
You tell me you need me
I walk_away bleeding and
Now I can see that
I'm on my own
How's this love when
I'm left with nothing
You take what you need and run
Cold and numb when
You up and leave me
You take what you need and run
How's this love when
I'm left with nothing
You take what you need and run
Cold and numb when
You up and leave me
You take what you need and run
She_knows when I am lonesome
She cries when I am sad
She's up in the good_times
She's down in the bad
Whenever I am discouraged
She_knows just what to do
But girl
She doesn't know about you
I can tell her my troubles
She makes them all seem right
I can make up excuses
Not to hold her at night
We can talk of tomorrow
I'll tell her things
that I wanna do
But girl
How can I tell her about you
How can I tell her about you
Girl please tell me what to do
Everything seems right
whenever I'm with you
So girl won't you tell me
How to tell her about you
How can I tell her
I don't miss her
Whenever I am away
How can I say it's you I think of
Every_single night and day
But when is it easy telling
someone the truth
Oh girl
help me tell her about you
How can I tell her about you
Girl please tell me what to do
Everything seems right
whenever I'm with you
So girl won't you tell me
How to tell her about you
Don't hold yourself
like that
You'll hurt your knees
I kissed your mouth
and back
But that's all I need
Don't build your
world around
volcanoes melt you down
What I am to you
is not real
What I am to you
you do not need
What I am to you
is not what you mean to me
You give me miles
and miles of mountains
And I'll
ask for the sea
Don't throw yourself
like that
In front_of me
I kissed your mouth
your back
Is that all you need
Don't drag my love
around that
volcanoes melt me down
What I am to you
is not real
What I am to you
you do not need
What I am to you
is not what you mean to me
give me miles
and miles of mountains
And I'll ask
for what I give to you
Is just what i'm
going through
This_is nothing new
No no just another
phase of finding
what I really need
Is what makes me bleed
And like a new disease
she's still
too_young to treat
Volcanoes melt me down
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's_still too_young
She's
you do not need me
Untouchable like
A distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out
And I just
Can't tell you why
I'm caught_up in you
I'm caught_up in you
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
And when you're close
I feel like coming_undone
In the middle_of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A_million little stars
Spelling_out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on come on
Little taste of heaven
It's half full
And I won't wait here
All day
I know you're saying
That you'd be here
Anyway
But you're
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
I feel like coming_undone
In the middle_of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A_million little stars
Spelling_out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on come on
In the middle_of the night
We could form this dream
I wanna feel you
By my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on come on
Little taste of heaven
I'm caught Up in you
Oh_oh
Oh_oh
Oh_oh
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
And when you're close
I feel like coming_undone
In the middle_of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A_million little stars
Spelling_out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on come on
Oh ohwa oh
In the middle_of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A_million little stars

I could million_little stars
Spelling_out your name
Spelling_out your name
Took the breath from my open mouth
Never known how it broke me down
I went in circles somewhere else
Shook the best
when your love was home
Storing up on your summer glow
You went in search of someone_else
And I hear your ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in
My dear is it all we've ever been
Caught the air in your woven mouth
Leave it all I'll be hearing
how you went
In search of someone_else
They taught the hand
that taut the bride
Both our eyes locked to the tide
We went in circles somewhere else
And I hear your ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in
My dear is it all we've ever been
Anchor up to me love
Anchor up to me love
Anchor up to me love
Oh anchor up to me
My love my love my love
I never thought that I would find you
All the years were passin' on through
Even_though l wanted true love
My happy ending was in doubt
I thought my time had run out
I didn't know how it felt to be loved
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It_was then that I knew
We would be two just me and you
Me and you
Now together like ouu_ouu ouu
Feel the love comin' through
Right out of the blue
Out of the blue
You came out of the blue
And I love you I do
We have a gift a beautiful romance
And I love the way it happened
Eloping in Vegas
me in my white_dress
It is never too_late
for a new chapter
For love ever after
New adventures and laughter
Mmmmmm
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It_was then that I knew
We would be two just me and you
Me and you
Now together like ouu_ouu ouu
Feel the love comin' through
Right out of the blue
Out of the blue
You came out of the blue
And I love you I do
Finally the universe aligned
After all this time
I hope we never have to be apart
But if we do you're in my heart
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It_was then that I knew
We would be two just me and you
Me and you
Now together like ouu_ouu ouu
Feel the love comin' through
Right out of the blue
Ouu ouu_ouu
ou ou ou ou ouu_ouu ouu
Ou ou ou ou ouu_ouu ouu
Ouu ouu_ouu
Then one day
You came out of the blue
It_was then that I knew
It's just me and you
I'm going under and this time
I fear there's_no one to save me
This all or nothing really
got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
somebody to know
Somebody to have
somebody to hold
It's easy to say
but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way
you numbed all the pain
And now the day
bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to
get me through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used_to being
someone you loved
I'm going under and this time
I fear there's_no one to turn to
Ohh-oh-oh
This all or nothing way of loving
got me sleeping without you-u-u
Now I need somebody to know
somebody to heal
Somebody to have
just to know how it feels
It's easy to say
but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way
you help me escape
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
to get me through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used_to being
someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes
when it hurts sometimes
I fall_into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound
till I come_back around
And now the day bleeds
into nightfall
And you're not here to get me
through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used_to being
someone you loved
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
to get me through it all
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used_to being
someone you loved
I let my guard down
and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used_to being
someone you loved
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of
joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could_skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy
scene I wish I had a river
I could_skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could_skate away on
I made my baby cry
He tried hard to help me
You know he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could_skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the
best baby That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could_skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could_skate away on
I made my baby say_goodbye
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of
joy and peace
I wish I had a river
I could_skate away on
Midnight
and I'm a waiting
on the twelve oh five
Hoping it'll take me just a
little farther down the line
Moonlight
you're just a
heartache in disguisel
Won't you keep my heart
from breaking
if it's only for a
very short time
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
who'll do_anything for you
Laying out another lie
thinking 'bout a
life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away_from you
Honey
you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody
telling everybody
what you have done
Baby
I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing
out the heartaches
you know you got to
have you some
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
who'll do_anything for you
Laying out another lie
thinking_about a
life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away_from you
Lovers
I know you've had a few
But hide your heart
beneath the covers
and tell 'em
they're the only one
And others
they know just
what I'm going through
And it's a hard
to be a lover when
you say
you're only in it for fun
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
who'll do_anything for you
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
who'll do_anything for you
Laying out another lie
thinking_about a
life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away_from you
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
Playing_with the
queen of hearts
One_more time
Let's say you give me
one_more time
One_last chance to speak again
Let's start from
what we left unsaid
And here we go
Brave enough to go
climbing a wall
So high that no sunlight
is seen through winter
Brave enough to go
traveling around the world
Without money to eat or sleep for
Seeing what you can do
with your hands and feet
I feel there is no question about it
Almost anything you can imagine
Almost any goal you will get there
I wish you had been
more of a talker
Not the kind that is just
flapping his lips
And not the kind that looks away
But learns through his eyes
when somеbody is watching
Maybe you could have told me
Thеre was a world on
your shoulders that needed lifting
Maybe I could have
helped you with that
The weight is not easy I know
But you never know
I thought your shoes were good
I thought they would take you
to the end of any road
I thought your back was strong
But I should have carried
you to the top of the rocky trail
Carried you to the top
of the rocky trail
I should have carried you
to the top of the rocky trail
How am I to know about your
problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
How am I to know about your
problems and your load
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
Just because you scare me
doesn't mean
I'm scared to be the one you love
It's me or it's another girl
I see you're not exclusive for me
Ayy yeah oh
Just because you're married
doesn't make me
care about your other love
the one's you love
It's true that I'm no Aphrodite
but I think
that i really might be the one
When I hear you're name
oh I feel like I am drawn
Catch myself just staring
yeah all my pride is gone
Just because you scare me
doesn't mean
I'm scared to be the one you love
It's me or it's another girl
But does she call you honeybunch
I am sitting In the morning
At the diner On the corner
I am waiting At the counter
For the man To pour the coffee
And he fills it Only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking Out the window
At somebody Coming in
It is always Nice to see you
Says the man Behind the counter
To the woman Who has come in
She is shaking Her umbrella
And I look The other way
As they are kissing Their hellos
I'm pretending Not to see them
Instead I pour the milk
I open Up the paper
There's a story Of an actor
Who had died While
he was drinking
It_was no_one I had heard of
And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking For the funnies
When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so I raise my head
There's a woman On the outside
Looking inside Does she see me
No she_does not Really see me
Cause she_sees
Her own reflection
And I'm trying Not to notice
That she's hitching Up her skirt
And while she's Straightening
her stockings
Her hair Is getting_wet
Oh this rain It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening
To the bells Of the cathedral
I am thinking Of your voice
We just_tryna catch a good time
Even_if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin'_apple pie_moonshine
Yeah, we_pickin' on them
guitars_just right
Everybody singin'
"Dixieland Delight"
Like a bobber_on a wet_line
We just_tryna catch a good time
Eighty degrees and the sun
ain't even out
We got a spot a_couple miles
outta town
When that moon comes up,
you know what's_goin' down
We got them foldin'
chairs leanin way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
from where we at
We just_tryna catch a good time
Even_if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin'_apple pie_moonshine
Yeah, we_pickin' on them
guitars_just right
Everybody_singing
Dixieland_Delight
Like a bobber_on a wet_line
We just_tryna catch a good time
Way down here,
we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin',
"Hey Y'all"
Yeah, it don't take much for us
to have it all (That's right)
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right_here
and let the world go by
We just_tryna catch a good time
Even_if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin'_apple pie_moonshine
Yeah, we_pickin' on them
guitars_just right
Everybody_singing
Dixieland_Delight
Like a bobber_on a wet_line
We just_tryna catch a good time
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
So we just gonna stay right_here
and let the world go by
We just_tryna catch a good time
Even_if it takes all night, al night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin'_apple pie moonshine,
sippin' apple_pie moonshine
Yeah, we_pickin' on them
guitars_just right
Everybody_singing
Dixieland_Delight
Like a bobber_on a wet_line
We just_tryna catch a good time
Tryna_catch a good time (Good time)
Good time
Tryna_catch a good time
Good time
Yeah, we try to catch a good time
(Good time)
Good time (Good time)
Tryna_catch a good time
(Good time, baby)
Good time
Aw, I think I got a bite
Girl you were looking at him
a little too long for me
to be your friend
And boy you were looking
at her a little too_short
for me to be yours
And I've_been really too nice I know
You probably thought that
we were just a show
But you better listen up
you better listen close
I don't think so
I think I should go
I can feel your eyes look_at me
and the door
Oh I can take a hint
Oh I can take a clue
You're giving me the go sir
You're giving me the boot
And I've_been really too nice I know
You probably thought that
we were just a show
But you left me utterly confused
I am not here for you to use
So you better listen up
You better listen close
I don't think so
no strings just living alone
and free
so happy there's_nothing
i really need
ever since you came around
i can finally be
anyone but me
maybe its crazy
and i'm acting a fool
but i like the way we match
and i'm_perfectly
i'm_perfectly distracted by you
looking back at me like you do
i've_got you distracted too
lost in the wonder
of all things new
attraction covering up the truth
hidden pictures of the messes
that I've_been through
all i see is you
everywhere I go
no matter_what I do
I keep missing you
don't mean to sound too cliche
open up the gates
not even sure
if I can meet halfway
all I know i
just can't think straight 'cause
maybe its crazy
and i'm acting a fool
but i like the way we match
and i'm_perfectly
i'm_perfectly distracted by you
looking back at me like you do
i've_got you distracted too
nothing's gonna get in my way
I'm totally committed
to this disarray
everywhere I go
no matter_what I do
I keep missing you
don't mean to sound too cliche
open up the gates
not even sure
if I can meet halfway
all I know i
just can't think straight 'cause
maybe its crazy
and i'm acting a fool
but i like the way we match
and i'm_perfectly
i'm_perfectly distracted by you
looking back at me like you do
i've_got you distracted
i've_got you distracted
i'm_perfectly distracted by you
I've_been less in my best
and I'm tryna invest
But I'm too tall in my little white_dress
Hands too_short
and I try to express that I'm a tryhard
when the teacher is their
Always say_yes and I don't know why
'Cause the boys want sex
while the girls want time
Life's always greener on the other_side
So I take one drink_cheers to the night
Ohh ohh
I would rather be home in my bed
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink_cheers to the night
Ohh ohh
This new girl
that you know was never me
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink_cheers to the night
I feel weak and I need
This person I perfected
But who cares
I don't wanna be rejected
Look in the mirror
and tell me acceptance
Care don't much about
others perception
I never really wanted to loose my way
But I got caught_up
in what the world might say
Life's always greener on the other_side
So I take one drink_cheers to the night
Ohh ohh
I would rather be home in my bed
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink_cheers to the night
Ohh ohh
This new girl
that you know was never me
But I don't wanna be alone tonight
So I take one drink_cheers to the night
I scrolled down your insta page
Saw a picture that I didn't wanna see
He had his_hand around your waist
And a smile on your_face
like the way you look_at me
Cause only eight_months ago
he was holding your hand
Slow dancing and
kissing the top of your head
And I, don't know
how to compete_with that
'Cause you were friends
since you were kids
And still feels_like we just only met
Yeah, I was so naive
Thinking that you've only
felt this way for me
You always tell me I'm the only one
you wanna be with
So why can't I believe it?
Yeah, old boyfriends kinda scare me
Cause they all gotta' little_bit of
history with you
Even when you try to tell me
I got no real reason to worry, my
Mind starts to imagine things
that never happened
I start to believe that
you’re still in love
With some other has been,
baby I’m just asking
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last_one?
The last_one?
I’ve heard stories about exes
Calling up brides on their wedding day
Professing all the love
from a once upon a time
that that threw away
And the fear that that
I’m fighting is constantly
rising in the back of my mind
Is that you’ll finally
open up your eyes
That you’ll leave me for another guy
Yeah it’s a scary truth
That maybe I don’t know you
in the way they do
You always tell me I’m the only one
you wanna be with
So why can't I believe it?
Yeah, old boyfriends kinda scare me
Cause they all gotta' little_bit of
history with you
Even when you try to tell me
That I got no real reason to worry, my
Mind starts to imagine things
that never happened
I start to believe that
you’re still in love
With some other has been,
baby I’m just asking
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last_one?
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last_one?
Baby the hardest part
Is fighting back this anxious heart
But I have come to realize that
if we don’t have trust then
We might as well have nothing
But old boyfriends still scare me
They all gotta little_bit of
history with you
Even when you try to tell me
I got no real reason to worry, my
Mind keeps on imagining
Things that I know aren’t happening
I start believe that
you’re still in love
With some other has been,
baby I’m just asking
Do you think
I’m gonna be the last_one?
Last one, do you think
I'm gonna be the last_one?

I′ve got the best_thing
in the world
Coz′I got you in my heart
And this screw little world
Let′s hold hand together
We can share forever
Maybe someday the sky will be
coloured with our love
I wake_up in the morning
Feeling emptyness in my heart
This pain is just too real
I dream about you
with someone_else
Please say that you love me that
we′ll never be apart
You have to promise
That you will ne faithfull
And there will be lots
and lots of love
It is the thing that really
matters in this world
I′ve got the best_thing
in the world
Coz′ I got you in my heart
And this screw little world
Let′s hold hand together
We can share forever
Maybe someday the sky will be
coloured with our love
You have to promise
That you will be faithful
And there will be lots
and lots of love
It is the thing that realy
matters in this world
Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right_here waiting_for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart_breaks
I will be right_here waiting_for you
I took for_granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh can't you see it baby
You've_got me going crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right_here waiting_for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart_breaks
I will be right_here waiting_for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance
And oh can't you see it baby
You've_got me going crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right_here waiting_for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart_breaks
I will be right_here waiting_for you
I will be right_here waiting_for you
I will be right_here waiting_for you
I was a quick wet boy
Diving too deep for coins
All of your straight blind eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog eared map
And called for you everywhere
Have I found you
Flightless bird jealous weeping
Or lost you
American mouth
Big bill looming
Now I'm a fat house cat
Cursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide
white fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures thrown
in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream
Have I found you
Flightless bird
brown hair bleeding
Or lost you
American mouth
Big bill stuck going down
Southern nights have you ever felt a
Southern night free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes
that you know and love so
Southern nights
just as good even when
Closed your eyes I apologize
To any one who can truly say
He has found a better way
Southern skies have you ever noticed
Southern skies it's precious beauty
Lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through
your soul like the stories of old
Old man he and his dog
they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy
Feel so good
feel so good it's frightening
Wish I could stop
this world from fighting
La da_da da_da da la da_da da_da da
Da_da da_da da_da da_da da_da da
Mysteries like this and many others
In the trees blow in the night
In the southern skies
Southern nights
They feel so good it's fright'ning
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La da_da da_da da la da_da da_da da
da_da da_da da_da da_da da_da da
Now go stand in the corner
and think_about what you did
Ha
The story starts when it was
hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him
right there where I wanted him
She came along got him along
and let's hear the applause
She took him_faster than
you can say_sabotage
I never saw it coming
nor did I suspected it
I underestimated
just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain
was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just
who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's_an actress
She's better known for the
things that she_does
On the mattress
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing I do
better_than revenge
She lives her life like it's a
party and she's on the list
She_looks at me like
I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present
frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho
Cause I like to rhyme her
name with things
but
Sophistication isn't
what you wear
or who you know
Or pushing people down to
get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that
in prep school
So it's up to me
But no_amount of vintage dresses
gives you dignity
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's_an actress
She's better known for the things
that she_does
On the mattress
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing I do
better_than revenge Ha ha
I'm just another thing for you
to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to
roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but I always get the last word
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's_an actress
She's better known for the things
that she_does
On the mattress
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing
I do better_than revenge
And do you still
feel like you know
what you're_doing
Cause I don't think you do Oh
Do you still feel like
you know what you're_doing
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how_much
better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you're so_much better
She took him_faster than
you can say_sabotage
Sitting in my driveway
Underneath the night scape
Covered by the car shade
Trying to find the words to say
Been planning this for hours
Hiding notes inside your flowers
Was not the time to be a coward
That time was ours
So tell me how to pause that night
I see beauty when I close my eyes
For a moment everything was right
And sometimes
I start to think that
If nothing_lasts forever dear
Lets remember
what we had right_here
Under the stars
where we disappeared
And I said those words to you
Baby thats a bold move
The perfect line
I wrote about a thousand times
You said keep your eyes
inside of mine
And don’t hide
Then your eyes smiled
So we stayed there for a while
Our fears pushed
ten_thousand miles
Just focused on you
So tell me how to pause that night
I see beauty when I close my eyes
For a moment everything was right
And sometimes
I start to think that
If nothing_lasts forever dear
Lets remember
what we had right_here
Under the stars
where we disappeared
And I said those words to you
Baby thats a bold move
Now I know
I know nothing about this
How you came in my life that day
In god's grace we were surrounded
And I heard you say
you felt so safe
So tell me how to pause that night
I see beauty when I close my eyes
For a moment everything was right
And sometimes
I start to think that
If nothing_lasts forever dear
Lets remember
what we had right_here
Under the stars
where we disappeared
And I said those words to you
Baby thats a bold move
Black coffee in our favorite cups
We used_to like the sweeter stuff
Thought I'd say it, but you said it first
We look nothing like the way we were
You wanna go to parties now
We used_to never leave the couch
Thought you'd say it, but I'll say it first
Don't say another word
[Chorus: Ross Copperman & Cam]
We're just, we're just different people
We're not innocent people
A_thousand sorry's from where we started
I guess we're just goin' through phases
Wеarin' different faces
You know еverything changes, darlin'
Don't, don't be sad
'Cause the time that we had wasn't_meant to last
Everything changes, everything changes
[Verse 2: Cam]
You met me at a brighter time
Now you see me in a different light
Hard to see you in a room this dark
It'll never be the way it was
'Cause you wanna go to parties now
We used_to wanna settle_down
Thought you'd say it, but I said it first
Don't say another word
[Chorus: Ross Copperman & Cam]
We're just, we're just different people
We're not innocent people
A_thousand sorry's from where we started
I guess we're just goin' through phases
Wearin' different faces
You know everything changes, darlin'
Don't, don't be sad
'Cause the time that we had wasn't_meant to last
Everything changes, everything changes
[Post-Chorus: Ross Copperman]
Everything changes (Ooh), everything changes (Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus: Ross Copperman & Cam]
Don't, don't be sad
'Cause the time that we had wasn't_meant to last
Everything changes, everything changes
[Outro: Ross Copperman]
Ooh,_ooh, ooh
Ooh,_ooh, ooh
Everything changes (Ooh), everything changes (Ooh, ooh)
It's late in the evening
She's wondering what
clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long
blond hair
And then she_asks me
Do I look alright
And I say_yes
you look wonderful_tonight
We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking
around with me
And then she_asks me
Do you feel alright
And I say_yes
I feel wonderful_tonight
I feel wonderful
Because I see
the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just
don't realize
How much I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car_keys
She helps me to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn out the light
I say my darling
you were wonderful_tonight
Oh my darling
you were wonderful_tonight
You're feeling nervous
aren't you boy
With your quiet voice
and impeccable style
Don't ever let_them
steal your joy
And your gentle ways
to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt
in your_face
Dress you down
and tell you that your place
Is in the middle
when they hate the way
you shine
I see you tugging
on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it
and hide how_much it hurts
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin
let_'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies
I've_seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
You get discouraged
don't you girl
It's your brother's world
for a while longer
We gotta dance
with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream
call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt
in your_face
To call you weak
and then displace you
After carrying your baby
on your back
across the desert
I saw your eyes
behind your hair
And you're looking tired
but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin
let_'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies
I've_seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin
let_'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies
I've_seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
Oh Mary was a maiden
When the birds began to sing
She was sweeter
than the blooming rose
So early in the spring
Her thoughts were gay and happy
And the morning gay and fine
For her lover was a river boy
From the river in the pines
Now Charlie he got married
To his Mary in the spring
When the trees were budding early
And the birds began to sing
But early in the autumn
When the fruit is in the wine
I'll return to you my darling
From the river in the pines
It_was early in the morning
In Wisconsin's dreary clime
When he rode the fatal rapids
For that last and fatal time
They found his body lying
On the rocky shore below
Where the silent water ripples
And the whispering cedars blow
Now every raft of lumber
That comes down the Chippewa
There's a lonely grave that's
Visited by drivers on their way
They plant wild flowers upon it
In the morning fair and fine
'Tis the grave of two young lovers
From the river in the pines
And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know
how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the
evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my believe
And yes I know
how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
but I don't let the
evening bring me down
Now that you're around me
And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them
I don't know
Settle down with me
cover me up cuddle me in
Lie down with me yeah
and hold me in your arms
And your heart’s
against my chest
your_lips pressed to my neck
I’m falling for your eyes
but they don’t know me yet
And with a feeling I’ll forget
I’m in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
This feels_like falling in love
falling in love falling in love
Settle down with me
and I’ll be your safety
you’ll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
but I’m cold as the wind_blows
So hold me in your arms
My heart’s against your chest
your_lips pressed to my neck
I’m falling for your eyes
but they don’t know me yet
And with this feeling
I’ll forget
I’m in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
This feels_like falling in love
falling in love falling in love
Yeah I’ve_been feeling everything
From hate to love
from love to lust from
lust to truth I guess
that’s how I know you
So hold you close
to help you give it up
So kiss me like you
wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
This feels_like falling in love
falling in love falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
This feels_like falling in love
falling in love falling in love
I always miss you but today
it's worse
You'll burn a_bridge or die
from thirst
you've seen your dreams
Homely scenes can crush
you like a bug
I always miss you but today
it's worse
You'll gain a mile just for
a while
I know it's hard to travel
when the rope
Is tied in one end
The sound of the train comin
round isn't there
And I'm scared as a cat it will
all disappear
You can sow your oats
Run a mile ahead
Break your legs or stay
in bed
Hide for months_or lose
yourself
Leave me twice or wake
up for once
Cause if you keep this up
you're gonna lose me
Oh and I don't wanna
be lost
I always miss you even
when you're here
Weve had some fights let's
leave it there
Oh I wish you'd tell me
something
don't leave me here with
nothing right_now
How I wish you'd come home
in the night and prove me wrong
That you'd take away all the
fears that haunt my bones
You can sow your oats
Run a mile ahead
Break your legs or stay
in bed
Hide for months_or lose
yourself
Leave me twice or wake_up
for once
You can sow your oats
Run a mile ahead
Break your legs or stay
in bed
Hide for months_or lose
yourself
Leave me twice or wake_up
for once
Cause if you keep this up
you're gonna lose me
Oh and I don't wanna be lost
I always miss you but today
it's worse
You'll burn a_bridge or die
from thirst
you've seen your dreams
Homely scenes can crush
you like a bug
Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A_million tomorrows
shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy
that is mine Today
I'll be a dandy
and I'll be a rover
You'll know who I am
by the songs that I sing
I'll feast at your table
I'll sleep in your clover
Who_cares what the morrow
shall bring
Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A_million tomorrows
shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy
that is mine Today
I can't be contented
with yesterday's glory
I can't live on promises
winter to spring
Today is my moment
now is my story
I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing
Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A_million tomorrows
shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy
that is mine Today
Today while the blossoms
still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A_million tomorrows
shall all pass away
'Ere I forget all the joy

I walked around for hours
two ten pence pieces in my hand
I was alone and freezing
still trying hard to understand you
I left the others knowing
I had to work this by myself
but now the feeling's growing
I would be better off with their help
so baby what we've got has lately
not been enough
not been enough
I wish I had your scarf still
that once embraced and kept me warm
I wish you could be with me
in these last days when I am still
hopelessly poor
stay out of trouble stay in touch
try not to think_about me too_much
stay out of trouble stay in touch
try not to think_about me too_much
Your little hands wrapped
around my finger And it's
so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter
cause you're dreaming So I
tuck you in and turn on
your favorite night light
To you everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Wont let no_one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow_up
Never grow_up
You're in the car
on the way to the movies And you're
mortified your mama's
dropping you off
At 14 there's just so_much
you can't do
And you can't_wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don't make
her drop you off around the block
Remember she's getting older too
And don't
lose the way that you dance
around in your PJs
getting ready for school
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
No_one's ever burned
Nothing's ever left you scarred
Even_though you want to
just try to never grow_up
Take pictures in your mind of
your childhood room
Memorize what is sounded like
what your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps
remember the words said
And all your little brother's
favorite_songs
I just realized everything
I had is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big_city
they just dropped me off
It's so_much colder than I
thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and
turn my nightlight on
Wish_I'd never_grown up
I wish I'd never_grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow_up
Wish_I'd never_grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow_up
Wish_I'd never_grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no_one break your heat
And even throuhg toyu want to
please try to never grow_up
Don't you ever_grow up
Just never grow_up

When I saw you standing_there
I 'bout fell out my chair
And when you moved
your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet
Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd_only let it be
You told yourself years ago
You'd never let your feelings show
The obligation that you've made
For the title that they gave
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd_only let it be
Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd_only let it be
Oh baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd_only let it be
It's one o'clock in the morning
And we're in an apartment
In the capital city
In a Catholic country
Got my back on the carpet
And my feet to the ceiling
To get the blood flowing
To numb the pain I'm feeling
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
Yesterday she took me
To a wintery garden
Past a forest of consciеnce
On a curvy road
With every_hour of passing
I startеd to believe in
The bubble I've_been dreaming
Had a floor on the ceiling
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I want you
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I want you
Ah-ah
To be with someone so precious
That it makes me anxious
To be there by the target
And know that I could miss it
I never felt so lonely
As when you came and saw me
And the following moment
Took your eyes off me
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've_been running
and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.
Layla, you've_got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling_won't you ease
my worried mind.
I tried to give you consolation
When your old_man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
Turned my whole_world upside down.
Layla, you've_got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling_won't you ease
my worried mind.
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane.
Please_don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain.
Layla, you've_got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling_won't you ease
my worried mind.
Layla, you've_got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling_won't you ease
my worried mind.
Give me love like her
cause lately
I've_been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops
on my shirt
Told you I'd let_them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns
into alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me
or burn this out
We'll play_hide and
seek to turn this around

Of all the money
that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm
that e'er I've_done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've_done for
want of width
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good_night and joy
be with you all
Of all the comrades
that ever I had
They are sorry for
my going away
And all the sweethearts
that ever I had
They would wish me one
more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and
you should not
I'll gently rise and
I'll softly call
Good_night and joy be
with you all
A man may drink
and not be drunk
A man may fight
and not be slain
A man may court
a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed
back again
But since it has
so ordered been
By a time to rise
and a time to fall
Come fill to me
the parting glass
Good_night and
joy be with you all
Good_night and
joy be with you all
Never did believe
In what I couldn't see
Long before I knew
Darling I was made for you
Took a train downtown
Gave us time to talk_about
The things that we could do
Darling I was made for you
Oh I was made for you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Darling I was made for you
Any other guy
That made you say_goodbye
Must've been a fool
But darling I was made for you
There's not much that I know
Been searching high and low
The one_thing that is true
Darling I was made for you
Oh I was made for you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Darling I was made for you
With your smile illuminating
Save my heart that needed saving
No way I could be mistaken
Darling I was made for you
There's not much that I know
Been searching high and low
The one_thing that is true
Darling I was made for you
Oh I was made for you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Darling I was made for you
Oh I was made for you
Darling I was made for you
Oh I was made for you
I heard I heard
In the meadow in the meadow
As I walked as I walked
A lonely road a lonely road
I heard I heard
A little voice
Up in the trees
And she sang a little song
She_said Why don’t you sing_along
Life’s too_short to sing it on your own
I heard I heard
On the subway on the subway
As I hung as I hung
My head down low
my head down low
I heard I heard
Zula say Why you crying
And he sang a little song
He said Why don’t you sing_along
Life’s too_short to sing it on your own
It’s a new year it’s a new day
So we’ll fall in love
with the sun and the stars
And we’ll break away_from the rain
We don’t need anyone to tell us where
We don’t need anyone to be free
So we’ll drive away
with the wind in our hair
And a pocket full_of Do Re Mi
Tweet tweet_twee da_lee deet_dah dee

It’s a new year I heard
Its a new day in the meadow
So we’ll fall in love
with the sun and the stars
As I walked
And we’ll break away_from the rain
A lonely road
We don’t need anyone to tell us where
I heard
We don’t need anyone to be free Oh
So we’ll fly_fly
Yeah we’ll fly_away
Oh we’ll fly_fly
With the wind in our hair
We’ll fly_away with the wind
in our hair and a pocket
full_of Do Re Mi
There'll_be no strings to
bind your hands
Not if my love
can find your heart
there's_no need to
take a stand
For it was
I who chose to start
I see no need to
take me home
I'm old enough
to face the dawn
Just call me
angel of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me
angel of the morning_angel
Then slowly turn away
from me
Maybe the sun's light
will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says
we've sinned
Well it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims
of the night
I won't be blinded
by the night
Just call me
angel of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me
angel of the morning_angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay
with me
through the tears
of the day
of the years baby
Just call me angel
of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me baby
Just call me
angel of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling
Just call me
angel of the morning_angel
Just touch my cheek
before you leave me darling
Red green and indigo

She’s underwater again
Somebody’s daughter a friend
In the night in the dark in the cold
As she walks far_away
Nobody’s watching
Drowning_in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
I don’t mind
Hope is a distance Unreached
Ink on her skin incomplete
And the faint sound of friends
As she neared to the end
she had peace
Nobody’s watching
Drowning_in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
I don’t mind I don’t mind
Where does her start go from here
Lost In the grip
Nobody’s watching
Drowning_in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
Nobody’s watching
Drowning_in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
I don’t mind I don’t mind
I don’t mind I don’t mind
Wherever you are
Well know that I adore you
No_matter how far
Well I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
I know that I am willing
Oh and I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a strangers' eyes
Wherever you go
Well I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If it's a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well I can wait without waiting
And if you want me to let this go
Well I am more_than willing
O 'cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye
O and I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye
I've never been with anyone
In the way I've_been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then it's doomed 'cause
Water races
Water races down the waterfall
The water races
Water races down the waterfall
And I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across a manger
Where there is no danger
Where love has eyes and is not
blind
Yeah, I’ve_been
throwin’ down the whiskey
I oughta get my money back
And someone said
it drowns a memory
Ah, but it ain’t_doing jack
Yeah, I’ve_been sippin’,

Shootin’ doubles like it’s nothin’

Road dogs are built for sleepin' in
I've_been up since 4 am
At your worst, you're better_than my better days
There_ain't been no sun in LA
Since you moved out of Sarah's place
I love your mother's stories 'bout you as a kid
I heard you scored a job in the east village
While working for some folks who don't know your name
Well, ain't you gonna miss all of them wasted days?
We'd sit around, drinkin' out at Sarah's place
Don't come_back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good_times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your_face
Out at Sarah's Place
And you called to talk just last week
I'm still fallin' apart like I'll always be
And your picnic chair is still sittin' there in the yard
And I had to sell my old guitar
But don't come_back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good_times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your_face
Out at Sarah's Place
You'll always be a piece_of mine, a piece_of mine
We drove that road we know at_least a million_times
I'm so damn tired_of seeing that empty drive
Out at Sarah's Place
Don't come_back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good_times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your_face
Out at Sarah's Place
Oh ah, hey
Mmm, mmm
Plane tickets have gotten awfully expensive
But I got mine for the price of a Gibson
Once there were green fields
Kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys
Where rivers used_to run
Once there were blue_skies
With white clouds high above
Once there were part_of
An everlasting love
We were the lovers who strolled
Through green fields
Green fields are gone now
Parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys
Where rivers used_to run
Gone with the cold wind
That swept into my heart
Gone with the lovers
Who let their dreams depart
Where are the green fields
That we used_to roam
I'll never know
What made you run_away
How can I keep searching
When dark_clouds hide the day
I only know
There's_nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world
Left for me to see
But I'll keep on waiting
Till you return
I'll keep on waiting
Until the day you learn
You can't be happy
While your hearts on the roam
You can't be happy
Until you bring it home
Home to the green fields and me
Once again
I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react
And games that never amount
To more_than they're meant
Will play themselves out
Take this sinking boat
and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful
voice you have a choice
You've make it now
Falling slowly
eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me
and erase me
And I'm painted black
You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won
Take this sinking boat
and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful
voice you had a choice
You've made it now
Falling slowly
sing your melody
I'll sing_along
Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy
I've_been walking these streets so long
Singing the same_old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle is the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are_shining on me
후렴 : Like a rhinestone_cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone_cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone
Well I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're_riding a train
That's taking the long way
And I dream of the thing I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are_shining on me
Woah slow down
Take it easy
There's a long line behind you
Lower your voice please
I know it's my job to make it
the way you want it
Like a raspberry mocha
Or a caffe macchiato
Or a non-fat one-pump latte
with two added shots of espresso
Relax and put it in perspective
I mean really
It's just a fucking_cup of coffee_lady
Is it really gonna break your day
If it's not exactly your way
It's just a fucking_cup of coffee_lady
Get another one for free
but don't take it out on me
It's just a fucking_cup of coffee
Hey OK
I get you're really pissed
But you're overreacting
Being ridiculous
Said a little too_much of this
Or not quite enough of that
Is it too hot to sip it
Is it not non-fat
Did your house burn down
Did your dog die
Did you catch your husband in the act
Come on it's not the end of the world
I mean really
It's just a fucking_cup of coffee_lady
Is it really gonna break your day
If it's not exactly your way
It's just a fucking_cup of coffee_lady
Get another one for free
but don't take it out on me
It's just a fucking_cup of coffee
I wish I could punch you in the face
But I can't
I wish I could stand up
on this counter and rant
But I can't
Instead I have to say
Have a nice day
But by the way
It's just a fucking
cup of coffee_lady
Is it really gonna break your day
If it's not exactly your way
It's just a fucking
cup of coffee_lady
Get another one for free
but don't take it out on me
It's just a fucking_cup of coffee
Oh it's just a fucking_cup of coffee

So you are out of a relationship
But no you are not over her yet
And no matter_how
many_times you begged
She moved on
So you lean a little_closer to me
compliment and call me cutie
Yes I know you only want me
to prove your low self esteem wrong
Hey don't be sorry
that you don't_care
That you'll_never love me

We're gonna get down
So you can forget

Stop calling me your girlfriend
Stop Stop Stop

the stars above
Or the perfect girl
you are dreaming of
I know I'm never gonna mean
that much to you
And it's really getting
on my nerves

you enough to see the real truth
That you are not_sorry

That you'll_never love me
Well I'm quite aware
I'm just a rebound
We're gonna get down

since we first met
Sure I'd like to be more_than this
But I am not her
And yeah that hurts
But don't check in or take me out
Don't buy me things
or snuggle after
when you are all after
is still cool with me
I'll be your rebound
We're gonna get down
So you can forget
I'm just a rebound
Stop calling me your girlfriend
I'm just a rebound
I'm just a rebound
I'm just a rebound
Stop calling me your girlfriend
There’s a chill blowin’ in the air
Pretty white lights everywhere
Strip malls and parking
lots are packin’ out
Weatherman sayin’ it might snow
Might as well keep off the road
So whatcha say
we stay_here at the house
Me and you
We’ll_throw a holiday_party
Don’t tell anybody
We’ll pour us a drink and
hang some lights on the tree
We’ll be jingle_bell rockin’
Til the neighbors come knockin’
So turn up the fire playin’ on the TV
Watchin’ for Santa
from the top of the roof
While we’re wrapped up
in a blanket for two
We’ll_throw a holiday_party
Holiday party
For just me and you
We can say that we’re not in town
When our friends say meet us out
We’ll just keep hangin’
like the mistletoe
And we’ll sing karaoke
Slip on somethin’ cozy
Cuz we ain’t got nowhere to go
We’ll_throw a holiday_party
Don’t tell anybody
We’ll pour us a drink and
hang some lights on the tree
We’ll be jingle_bell rockin’
Til the neighbors come knockin’
So turn up the fire playin’ on the TV
Watchin’ for Santa
from the top of the roof
While we’re wrapped up
in a blanket for two
We’ll_throw a holiday_party
Holiday party
For just me and you
And when New Year’s
Eve rolls around
We ain’t gotta shut it down
We’ll_throw a holiday_party
Don’t tell anybody
We’ll pour us a drink
and hang some lights on the tree
We’ll be jingle_bell rockin’
Til the neighbors come knockin’
So turn up the fire playin’ on the TV
Watchin’ for Santa
from the top of the roof
While we’re wrapped up
in a blanket for two
We’ll_throw a holiday_party
Holiday party
For just me and you
Summer love turnin' cold
Packed a bag hit the road
Another town full_of faces
I don't know
Spent a year runnin' circles
Trippin' on every hurdle
Fallin' down learnin'
how to let it go
Got a bottle full_of therapy
Gettin' used_to no company
Wasn't lookin' for anything
Wasn't lookin' for anything ayy
Went out I was drunk and lonely
Told myself it was one night only
Wasn't proud of the way
you found me
Dancin' with my broken_heart
Didn't care
where the time was goin'
'Fore we knew it
the bar was closin'
The hell'd you do to me
last_night
I'm wakin' up in love
at first light
Ooh_ooh-ooh
Ooh_ooh-ooh
Ooh_ooh-ooh
Wakin' up in love at first light
Small town I was feelin' stuck
Same cowboy different truck
I tried 'em on
now I'm all out of luck
We all know how it is
Settle down have some kids
Good for them but for me
it's not enough
Got a bottle full_of therapy
Gettin' used_to no company
Wasn't lookin' for anything
Wasn't lookin' for anything ayy
Went out I was drunk and lonely
Told myself it was one night only
Wasn't proud of the way
you found me
Dancin' with my broken_heart
Didn't care
where the time was goin'
'Fore we knew it
the bar was closin'
The hell you do to me last_night
I'm wakin' up in love

You got a fast_car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
But me myself I got nothing to prove
You got a fast_car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working
at the convenience store
Managed to save just
a little_bit of money
We won't have to drive too_far
Just 'cross the border
and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it
means to be living
You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle
that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too
young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from
life than he could give
I said somebody's
got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's
what I did
You got a fast_car
But is it fast_enough
so we can fly_away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die
this way
I remember we were driving driving
in your car
The speed so fast I felt_like
I was drunk
City_lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
be someone be someone
You got a fast_car
And we go cruising to entertain
ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market
as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house
and live in the suburbs
I remember we were
driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt_like
I was drunk
City_lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling
that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
be someone be someone
You got a fast_car
And I got a job that pays
all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends
than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together
you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast_car and
keep on driving
I remember we were driving driving
in your car
The speed so fast
I felt_like I was drunk
City_lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling
I could be someone
be someone be someone
You got a fast_car
But is it fast_enough
so you can fly_away
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight
or live and die this way
We took it slow
met you one night
and three days later
I called and said hello
And up at 4AM
we were still up talking
on the phone
And on the first_date
you wanted to wait for the first kiss
when I took you home
Yeah we took it slow
But you got over me
fast_girl fast_girl
That ain't that girl that girl
That I thought I knew
no it ain't like you
To just walk_away one day
next day
On to another dude
You're doing things
I thought you'd never do
Like a fast_girl
You got over me fast_girl fast_girl
But I thought you liked
slow dancing to slow jams
And holding hands was romance
enough for you
But when I leaned
in slow to taste your_lips
there was no slowing
down my fingertips
If we were like wine then
that whole night
was just one slow sip
But you got over me
fast_girl fast_girl
That ain't that girl that girl
That I thought I knew
no it ain't like you
To just walk_away one day next day
On to another dude
You're doing things
I thought you'd never do
Like a fast_girl
You got over me fast_girl fast_girl
You're tryna make me jealous
Tryna find a new me
Well that's real cute
But all that it's gonna
do is help get me getting over you
Fast girl fast_girl
That ain't that girl that girl
That I thought I knew
no it ain't like you
To just walk_away one day next day
On to another dude
You're doing things
I thought you'd never do
Like a fast_girl
You got over me fast_girl fast_girl
You got over me fast_girl fast_girl
Don't ask me 'bout tomorrow
Or tell me 'bout my past
My heart is yours to borrow
Ain't nothin' meant to last
I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi
Don't ask too_many questions
You don't want answers to
You don't like my direction
Hell I won't follow you
I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi
I told my dyin' daddy
that I had to run_away
Looked him in the eye
Said there_ain't no other way
So woman if I tell you
that I love you be okay
Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi
I love you in the mornin'
and when the day is done
But if you want my freedom
you know I'm bound to run
I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi
I told my dyin' daddy
that I had to run_away
Looked him in the eye
Said there_ain't no other way
So woman if I tell you
that I love you be okay
Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi
Do you know
how_much it took for me
To tell you that
I think you're fine as hell
And do you wanna
grab a bite to eat
I got this coupon to taco bell
You say you can't right_now and
when I ask you why
You finally let it out
you say I'm not your type
But I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I got more bite
than a California Zoo
And if you ask my momma
she gonna tell you the truth
That I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I got more pop
than a shook up mountain dew
If that's not what you like
There must be something
wrong with you
Cuz I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I see my family every holiday
That's when they love to
wreck my self-esteem
Ask me why I never bring a date
I think the first verse
covered everything
Say I need a real job
I tell them all please
I get to sing my songs
and everybody thinks
I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I got more bite
than a California Zoo
And if you ask my momma
she gonna tell you the truth
That I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I got more pop
than a shook up mountain dew
If that's not what you like
There must be something
wrong with you
Cuz I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
Got the high score on Pacman
at the arcade
I can still get a sunburn
sitting in the shade
I'm pretty much the best
at acting out charades
If anybody asks me I'm gonna say
I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I got more bite
than a California Zoo
And if you ask my momma
she gonna tell you the truth
That I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I got more pop
than a shook up mountain dew
If that's not what you like
There must be
Something wrong with you
Cuz I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
I'm a_freakin' delight
Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's a broken traffic light
Blinking softly
for an audience of one
A boy who takes his comfort
in the shelter of the night
And stays up until the morning
just because
Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's an_empty parking lot
Where he likes to go and
look up at the moon
Ask himself where things went
wrong and why he feels so caught
And hopes that things start
changing someday soon
Oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start
feeling like he should
Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's a table set for two
Where he'd like to find
some company to share
Spends the evening spilling
his whole_life to someone_new
Perfect smile and ribbon
in her hair
Somewhere in Ann Arbor
there's a vacant hotel_room
where he leaves
all of his lovers high and dry
Pretends he's got the thing
they want and
when he has them fooled
He crumbles and
escapes into the night
Oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start
feeling like he should
Oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start
feeling like he should
And oh he's got it all
He's got the life that they all
said that he would want
And oh he's got it good
So why the hell can't he start
feeling like he should
I know that I haven't been who I was

I've_been reckless in my own mind
Staying up night after night
What is the point of sleeping
when you're high
Feeling like royalty
Running like a machine
Oh what is the point of sleeping
I just need a little_bit of love
from you darling
from you darling
But a little_bit ain't ever
been enough
You gotta keep it coming
keep it coming
And I guess I'm a lot fucked up
and it's a problem
I've it the bottom
But you don't need to know

You don't need to know about that
You are so_bad for me
You are so_bad so_bad
And I need you desperately
You are so_bad so_bad
I've_been drinking you
like champagne
Pulling you into my veins
What is the point of sleeping
wide_awake
Losing track of the days
Stumbling through these miles
Oh when I really should be sleeping
I just need a little_bit of help
from you darling
from you darling
Cause I'm faling out than I ever fell
Leaving me with nothing
give me something
And you're fucking on my mental
health and it's a problem
And I've got a lot of 'em
But you don't need to know
you don't need to know
You don't need to know about that
You are so_bad for me
You are so_bad so_bad
And I need you desperately
You are so_bad so_bad

You are so_bad so_bad
I need you desperately
You are so_bad so_bad
Yeah you've_got me so_bad
Oh you make me so_bad
You know you get me so_bad
Every night around about this time
It’s like she knows I’m lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leaning on old memories
And talking ‘bout what used_to be
She’ll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain’t sweet
She’s my pretty_little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah she came with a warning
But I didn’t mind
I’ll go out on that high every_time
She’s my pretty_little poison
My pretty_little poison
Shadows dancin’ down the hall
Whispers that she_wants me
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind_of fix
For me, she’s the one I pick
Nothing else will do the trick
She’s all I need
She’s my pretty_little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah she came with a warning
But I didn’t mind
I’ll go out on that high every_time
She’s my pretty_little poison
My pretty_little poison
For some I guess_it’s alcohol
But I don’t want none at all
I just want you
No, I just want you
My pretty_little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah she came with a warning
But I didn’t mind
I’ll go out on that high every_time
She’s my pretty_little poison
My pretty_little poison
She’s my pretty_little poison
Baby lock the door
and turn the lights down low
Put some music on
that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've_been thinking
'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling
quite this strong
I can't believe
how_much it turns me on
Just to be your man
There's_no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little_closer
Lets go over
What I had in mind
Baby lock the door
and turn the lights down low
Put some music on
that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've_been thinking
'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling
quite this strong
I can't believe
how_much it turns me on
Just to be your man
Ain't_nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how
Long I've wanted to
Lock the door
and turn the lights down low
Put some music on
that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've_been thinking
'bout this all day long
never felt a feeling
that was quite this strong
I can't believe
how_much it turns me on
Just to be your man
I Can't believe
how_much it turns me on
Just to be your man
April come she will
When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June she'll change her tune
In_restless walks
she'll prowl the night
July she will fly
And give no warning
to her flight
August die she must
The autumn winds blow
chilly and cold
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old
You're just a small_bump
unborn in four_months
You're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands
be as gentle as I can
But for now your scan of
my unmade plans
A small_bump in four_months
You're brought to life
I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing
But truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can_wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You're just a small_bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of
a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed
to be soon opened wide
A small_bump in four_months
You'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing
But truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front_of me
For a_couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers
round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You were just a small_bump unborn
for four_months
then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why
I was scared of dentists and
the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and
starting conversations
Oh all my friends are turning
green
You're the magician's assistant
in their dreams
uh ooh_ooh oooh
uh ooh_ooh and they come unstuck
Lady running down to the riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing
that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think
you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job
and heads to New_York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the
highest shelf
uh ooh_ooh oooh
uh ooh_ooh and they come unstuck
Lady running down to the riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing
that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I just wanna I just wanna know
If you're gonna if you're gonna
stay
I just gotta I just gotta know
I can't have it I can't have it
any_other way
I swear she's destined for the
screen
Closest thing to Michelle
Pfeiffer that you've ever seen oh
Lady running down to the riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing
that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady running down to the
riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing
that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady running down to the
riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing
that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat
because you're gonna sing the
words wrong
I don't always wake_up
in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure_as hell can't keep
leanin' on you
Looks_like I'm learnin' the hard
way again
It's all my fault
Yeah I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone
three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've_wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries
I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy
and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent
wasted on you
Wasted on you
Yeah I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head
and these boots on my feet
Looks_like I'm learning
the hard way again
That's why I've_been wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries
I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy
and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Like this pile of your stuff
that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame
of this match
Wasted on you wasted on you
Wasted on you wasted on you
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries
I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy
and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you wasted on you

I said Oh my what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
never would forget
how we_moved
The_whole place
was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk
summer of '45
Picked me up
late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy
running wild wild
Can't remember what song
it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck
into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess
and a prince
And I said
Oh my what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
never would forget
how we_moved
The_whole place
was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
He said Look_at you
Worrying so_much about
things you can't change
You'll spend your whole_life
singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks
on the ocean saying to me
Don't you see the
starlight starlight
Don't you dream
impossible things
Like Oh my what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
never would forget how we_moved
The_whole place
was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Ooh_ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh_ooh dancing with me
Ooh_ooh we could get_married
Have ten kids and
teach 'em how to dream
Oh my what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
never would forget how we_moved
The_whole place was
dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like we dream_impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like we dream_impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight
starlight
Don't you dream
impossible things
Took a deep_breath in the mirror
He didn't like it
when I wore high heels but I do
Turn the lock and
put my headphones on
He always said he
didn't get this song but I do I do
Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early
and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out
and help me in
And you don't know
how nice that is but I do
And you throw your head
back laughing like a little_kid
I think it's strange that you think
I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've_been spending
the last_eight months
Thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin_again
You said you never
met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor
records as you but I do
We tell stories and
you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy but I do
But you throw your head
back laughing like a little_kid
I think it's strange that
you think I'm funny
'cause he never did
I've_been spending
the last_eight months
Thinking all love ever does
is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin_again
And we walked down
the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies
that your family watches
Every_single Christmas
and I will talk_about that
And for the first_time
what's past is past
'Cause you threw your head
back laughing like a little_kid
I think it's strange that
you think I'm funny
'cause he never did
I've_been spending
the last_eight months
Thinking all love ever does is
break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin_again
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin_again
Ships on vigor of the waves are skimming
Barren summits to the verdant plains
Each horizon is a new_beginning
Rise and reign
Far from the fjords and the ice cold currents
Ravens soar over new frontiers
Songs and sagas of a fate determined
Shields and spears
Vows of favour or the thrill of plunder
Pull together for the clan and kin
Clank of hammers and the crash of thunder
Pound within
Oh-ho-oh
The echoes of eternity
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla_calling me
Oh-ho-oh
To pluck the strings of destiny
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla_calling me
Valhalla_calling me
Sails a swaying on the crimson rivers
Blood and glory in the fighting fields
Shields a' shatter into splintered timbers
Iron and steel
Fires are rising and the bells are ringing
Glory, take us into Odin's halls
Golden glimmer and the sound of singing
Asgards call
Oh-ho-oh
The echoes of eternity
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla_calling me
Oh-ho-oh
To pluck the strings of destiny
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla_calling me
Valhalla_calling me
Wind and the waves will carry me
Wind and the waves will set me free
Wind and the waves will carry me
Wind and the waves will set me free
Oh-ho-oh
The echoes of eternity
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla_calling me
Oh-ho-oh
To pluck the strings of destiny
Oh-ho-oh
Valhalla_calling me
Valhalla_calling me
What do you know?
Suddenly you're older now
They call you a grown up, with the dog and the bills
And the garden, and the picturesque house
And the pear tree is budding up a third year
And if your mother were still here
The fallen blossoms on the lawn would all disappear
And you're in love, you pray to God it's forever
But you look around, and think why try altogether?
But he's endless, and on my skin like sand on the shore
And that's enough for me right_now anyway at 24
You travel the world, swim under a waterfall
You have everything you ever wanted
You wonder when your dad will call
And you're in New_York again
With your oldest friend
And the basket of bread's still warm
And that's enough for me right_now anyway at 24
Oh, I know more_than I ever have
And yet I know nothing at all
I'm a floating feather, I'm a constant cannonball
I'm somebody's baby, someone_else's midnight call
I know more_than I ever have
And yet nothing at all
Well, what do you know?
Suddenly you're 24
Riding on this know how
Never been here before
Peculiarly entrusted
Possibly that's all
Is history recorded
Does someone have a tape
Surely I'm no pioneer
Constellations stay the same
Just a little_bit of danger
When intriguingly
Our little secret
Trusts that you trust me
'Cause no_one will ever know
That this was happening
So tell me why you listen
When nobody's talking
Oh_oh oh
What is there to know
All this is what it is
Oh_oh oh
You and me alone
Sheer simplicity
Oh_oh oh
What is there to know
All this is what it is
Oh_oh oh
You and me alone
Sheer simplicity
Oh_oh oh
What is there to know
All this is what it is
Oh_oh oh
You and me alone
Sheer simplicity
Come let me sing into your ear
Those dancing days are gone
All the silk and satin gear
Crouch upon a stone
Wrapping that foul body up
In as foul a rag
I carry the sun in a golden_cup
The moon in a silver_bag
I carry the sun in a golden_cup
The moon in a silver_bag
Curse as you may I sing it through
What matter if the knave
That the most could pleasure you
The children that he gave
Are somewhere sleeping like a top
Under a marble flag
I carry the sun in a golden_cup
The moon in a silver_bag
I carry the sun in a golden_cup
The moon in a silver_bag
Come let me sing into your ear
I thought it out this very day
Noon upon the clock
All that silk and satin gear
A man may put pretense away
Who leans upon a stick
May sing and sing until he drop
Whether to maid or hag
I carry the sun in a golden_cup
The moon in a silver_bag
I carry the sun in a golden_cup
The moon in a silver_bag
Come let me sing into your ear
Those dancing days are gone
All that silk and satin gear
Crouch upon a stone
Wrapping that foul body up
In as foul a rag
I carry the sun in a golden_cup
The moon in a silver_bag
Beautiful you Beautiful you
Beautiful you Beautiful you
Beautiful you
You walk around
in your profound ways
Taking a little more each day
And you’re seeing things
as they are
And they’re not so far_from here
And you’re seeing things
as they’ll be
They’re not so different
from your dreams
But you’re ripping apart
at the seams and leaking out
Realizing all your crimes
and hidden doubts
Were there all along
There all along
There all along
There all along
And how do you get by sometimes
In the night
when you’re all alone
And thinking is suffocating
And just too_much
It’s just too_much
It’s just too_much
It’s just too_much
The days are flying by
And it’s coming down to this
It’s coming down to this
The years are flying by
And it’s coming down to this
It’s coming down to this
No_matter what you do
It’s coming down to this
There’s no need to cry
It’s coming down
to this To this
And all you really need to know
You know it
You know it
So you know what love is
And that it never dies
Even with hate
And all that counts is
you’re still standing
And your heart’s still beating
After all these_years
And you’re finally seeing
What’s been there all along
There all along
There all along
There all along
And don’t you know
it’s up to you
To mend your broken_heart
You’re still finding a way
You’re still finding your way
We’re all just finding our way
Beautiful you Beautiful you
Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful
Beautiful you
There's something on my mind
There's something on my mind
You're miles_away
but your heart feels close by
The sun is in my eyes
The sun is in my eyes
They_say love is blind but with you
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I know I'm meant
To be with you
You
Love is not enough
Why can't love just be enough
Right when it's good
time it messes it up
Please_don't let me go
When we come and go
Distance can help hearts to grow
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I know I'm meant
To be with you
You
Days are getting longer
The nights are feeling colder
When we are not together
I'm falling apart
'Cause all I want is you
And all I need is you
Baby you may be somewhere
else too_far from me
Come home soon
Oh-oh
There's something on my mind
There's something on my mind
You're miles_away
I'm so sick of goodbye
Roses are red
Violets are blue
One_day I'm meant
To be with you
You
Roses are red
Violets are blue
One_day I'm meant
To be with you
You

I don't know if there'll_be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come_true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake_up where the clouds are
far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you will find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Oh why oh why can't I
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And ake up where the clouds are
far behind me yeah
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you will find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I've heard of
once in a lullaby
I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full_of mumbles
such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears
what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more_than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low seeking out
the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking_for the places
Only they would know
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking_for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times
when I was so_lonesome
I took some comfort
there le_le le_le le_le le
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Then I'm laying out
my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New_York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till_he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving
But the fighter still_remains
mmm_mmm
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_lie lie
Lie_la lie_lie la_la la_la lie_la la_lie
I am not the kind_of girl
Who should be rudely barging
in on a white_veil occasion
But you are not the kind_of boy
Who should be marrying
the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she
is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped
like a pastry
This_is surely not
what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
where I stand and say
Don't say_yes run_away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single_vow
You need to hear me out
and they said_speak now
Fun gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to
play a song that sounds
like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It_seems that I was uninvited
by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
you wish it was me
Don't you
Don't say_yes run_away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single_vow
You need to hear me out
and they said_speak now
Don't say_yes run_away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single_vow
You need to hear me out
and they said_speak now
I hear the preacher say
speak_now or forever
hold your peace
There's the silence
there's my last_chance
I stand up with shaking hands
all eyes on me
Horrified looks from
everyone in the room But
I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind_of girl
Who should be rudely barging
in on a white_veil occasion
But you are not the kind_of boy
Who should be marrying
the wrong girl
Don't say_yes run_away now
I'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the backdoor
Don't wait or say a single_vow
You need to hear me out
said_speak now
And you say
lets run_away now
I'll meet when I'm out
of my tux at the backdoor
Baby I didn't say my vows
so_glad you were around
When they said Speak now
Put your hands to my hands
Put your knees to my knees
Put your eyes to my eyes
Come on baby compliment me
'Cause I don't think that we
Should ever feel the need to worry
Ever get ourselves in a hurry
You know I love you
I know you love me
So time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This_is so good
There's_no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
And this love will build
Through flights and streets
In the end I predict
You'll get the very best of me
So put your_lips to my lips
Why not go on and take all of it
And just run as_fast as you can
Just 'cause you can
'Cause time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This_is so good
There's_no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
I am almost 23
Confused with all the lines
in between
They are dying to be read
Softly spoken simply said
Tell me do you believe
In the girl that is me
With her feet to your feet
Well that's all that I need
'Cause time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This_is so good
There's_no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
Jingle_bell jingle_bell

To go glidin'

Feel it heavy in my bones now
Feel like everybody goes out
And smiles for the 'gram
Yeah tried but I can't
Prayer in the shape of Prozac
Try to medicate the lows that
Come and meet me
in the night time
Losing track of my time
Mama said gonna be all right
But mama don't know
what it's like in my mind
Mama said
that the sun gonna shine
But mama don't know
what it's like to want to die
I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt
inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay
Would you like me if I drank that
If you wanted I could take that
I'll do_anything for love
I don't feel like I'm enough
You can probably see
right through me
'Cause I can promise
if you knew me
You would probably walk_away
No you wouldn't want to stay
Oh mama said gonna be all right
But mama don't know
what it's like in my mind
Mama said that the sun gon' shine
But mama don't know
what it's like to want to die
I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt
inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay
I know I'll be fine it's just that
Every_time this comes back
Tell my maker up above that
I have had enough and
I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt
inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay
We ended a while ago
Thought everything was over with
I wanted you for so long
Took me two years to get over it
Your family fell for me
Harder than you did
They told you to treat me right
You always acted like a kid
Now I don't know what to do
I got a call yesterday afternoon
From someone I used_to know
Summer nights and the way
we kissed yeah
Thought I was done
didn't know I missed it
But when I heard her voice
I couldn't breathe
Tell your mom to stop calling me
No disrespеct

But shе reminds me of you and lately
I've_been holding myself up
from falling

But when she_calls my line

I'm getting calls from her

Wish I could hang up but I'm glued
Summer nights and the way
we kissed yeah
Thought I was done
didn't know I missed it
But when I heard her voice
I couldn't breathe
Tell your mom to stop calling me

When you're weary, feeling small
그대 지치고 스스로가 초라하게 느낄때
When tears are in your eyes,
그대 눈에 눈물이 고일때
I will dry them all
내가 눈물을 닦아줄께요
I'm on your side,
난 당신 곁에 있습니다.
Oh, when times get rough
곤경의 순간이 닥쳐오고
And friends just can't be found
친구들을 찾을 수 없을때...
Like a_bridge over_troubled water,
거친 충랑속에서도 버티는 다리처럼
I will lay me down
난 나를 낮추겠습니다.
Like a_bridge over_troubled water,
거친 충랑속에서도 버티는 다리처럼
I will lay me down
난 나를 낮추겠습니다
When you're down and out,
그대가 의기소침해져
When you're on the street
거리위를 방황 할때,
When evening falls so hard,
저녁 어둠이 내려앉아 아주 힘겨워할때
I will comfort you
나는 그대를 위로하며 힘을 줄 것입니다.
I'll take your part,
난 그대편이 될것입니다.
Oh, when darkness_comes
오, 어둠이 오고
And pain is all around
고통이 주위에 가득할 때....
.Like a_bridge over_troubled water,
거친 충랑속에서도 버티는 다리처럼
I will lay me down
난 나를 낮추겠습니다.
Like a_bridge over_troubled water,
거친 충랑속에서도 버티는 다리처럼
I will lay me down
난 나를 낮추겠습니다
Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are
on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a_bridge overtroubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a_bridge overtroubled water
I will ease your mind
Are you going to
Scarborough_Fair
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Remember me
to one who_lives there
She once was
a true love of mine
Tell_her to make me
a cambric shirt
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Without no seams
nor needless work
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell_her to find me
an acre of land
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Between the salt water
and the sea strand
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell_her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
And gather it all
in a bunch of heather
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Are you going to
Scarborough_Fair
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Remember me
to one who_lives there
She once was
a true love of mine
There was a time
when I was in a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day
when I just had to tell
my point of view
I was like you
Now I don't mean
to make you frown
No I just want you to slow down
Have you never been mellow
Have you never tried to find
a comfort from inside you
Have you never been happy
just to hear your song
Have you never
let someone_else be strong
Running around as you do
with your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back
kick your shoes off close your eyes
I was like you
Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone
to hold your hand
Have you never been mellow
Have you never tried to find
a comfort from inside you
Have you never been happy
just to hear your song
Have you never let
someone_else be strong
When I was younger
should have known better
I can't feel no remorse
and you don't feel nothing back
Got a new girlfriend
he feels_like he's on top
I don't feel no remorse
and you can't see past my blinders
Ophelia
you've_been on my mind girl
since the flood
Ophelia
heaven help a fool who falls in love
Got a little paycheck
you got big plans and
you gotta move
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small
Honey I love you
that's all she wrote
Ophelia
you've_been on my mind girl
like a drug
Ophelia
heaven help a fool who falls in love
Ophelia
you've_been on my mind girl
since the flood
Ophelia
heaven help a fool who falls in love
Ophelia
you've_been on my mind girl
like a drug
Ophelia

Someday we're gonna look back
on a night like tonight
The car I pulled up in
the necklace you're wearing won't
even cross our minds
Someday we're gonna blink twice
say it happens like that
How much money we saved up
for the time that we gave up
Well it'll all just be math
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many
sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering
what comes next
I just want to love you
like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close
enjoy you more
And spend a little_less time
keeping score
If we're rich to somebody
we're poor to somebody_else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take it with you
when you go
Life_is only getting faster
life is only getting faster
So baby
I'd_rather take tonight
nice and slow
'Cause I know I'm only human
Don't know how many
sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering
what comes next
I just want to love you
like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close
enjoy you more
And spend a little_less time
keeping score
Be with me now
Be with me right_now
Be with me right_here
right_now
Be with me now
Be with me right_now
Be with me right_here
right_now
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many
sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering
what comes next
I just want to love you
like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close
enjoy you more
And spend a little_less time
keeping score
Oh yeah
Keeping score

I don't mind

I'll take you there
I can go if you wanna go_anywhere

We can go to the Chateau_Marmont
And dance in the hotel_room
We can run with dead lights on
'til we got nothing to lose
We have lifting from the ground
We go ever coming down
I don't mind
if you wanna go_anywhere
I'll take you there
Everyday the weekend
I'm tryna be your best_friend
Trying just to figure it out
Go on and let your gun burst
Living on the outskirts
Trying just to figure it out
Talking like a deadbeat
I just wanted you to see
Everything that I could see
Walking in the night sky
I'm always on your side
You were really saving me
We can go to the Chateau_Marmont
And dance in the hotel_room
We can go to the Chateau_Marmont
And dance like
we got nothing to lose

A cold beer's got 12 ounces
A good truck's got maybe
three hundred thousand
You only get so_much
until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a 45
Are the kinda things that
only last so long
When the new wears off
and they get to getting old
Sooner_or later
time's gonna take its toll
They_say nothing_lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight
dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that
I could look_at my whole_life
A love like that makes a man
have second thoughts
Maybe some things
last forever after all
FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like
I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna
break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off
and they get to getting old
Yeah sooner or_later
time's gonna take its toll
They_say nothing_lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight
dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that
I could look_at my whole_life
A love like that makes a man
have second thoughts
Maybe some things
last forever after all
They_say nothing_lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight
dances in your eyes
And I know there'll_be that moment
The good Lord
calls one of us home and
One won't have the other
by their side
But heaven knows that
that won't last too long
Maybe some things
last forever after all
After all
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often
as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good
as I should have
If I made you feel
second best Girl
I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely
lonely times
I guess I never told you
I'm so happy
that you're mine
Little things
I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me Tell me
that your sweet love
hasn't died
Give me give me
One_more chance to keep you
satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things
I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Mama take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel I'm knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock_knock knockin'_on heaven's_door
I want to hold your eyes
Keep my heart on the tables
Sometimes what’s in my mind
doesn’t show on my face though
I want to fortify
without fossilizing
Redefine all the people I’ve_been
Breathe inside each moment I’m in
And walk_into a new horizon
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
Wish that I could feel the sun
without casting a shadow
Does sleeping in a soft bed
dampen my halo
I’ve made plans
takes time to change though
Or is that just words to say
Don’t heroes stand
outside the fables
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I just want to stay in the now
In the now
Never want to stray from the now
From the now
I just want to stay in the now
Never want to stray from the now
Screen to a page in the now
I lost my way from the now
Then I saw your_face in the now
And you’ve got a way with the now
So take my hand
and take me to the now
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I’m_trying to find my freedom
Freedom
I'm walking fast
through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone
with our changing minds
We fall in love
'til it hurts or bleeds
or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
You come around
and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room
and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken_hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never never
saw you coming
And I’ll never never
be the same
This_is a state of grace
This_is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These_are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This_is the golden age
of something good
And right and real
And I never never saw you coming
And I’ll never never
be the same
And I never never saw you coming
And I’ll never
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
Be the same
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken_hearts
But this love is brave and wild
This_is a state of grace
This_is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Take it easy my friend
Grab the chance will you can
It's time for us to move on
Let the world sing you a song
Take it easy my friend
Wipe the tears from your eyes
There's a magic in the air tonight
High in the light of your sky
You've_got to do
what you wanna do
Do what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
And don't be afraid
As_long as everybody's happy
everybody's happy
And everybody's feeling okay
You've_got to do
what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say
now Make it easy my friend
Cause the sour will come down
Just be true to yourself
Everything_will be alright
Take it easy my friend
Wipe the tears from your eyes
There's a magic
in the air tonight
High in the light of your sky
Do what you wanna do
Do what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say
Say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
And don't be afraid
As_long as everybody's happy
everybody's happy
And everybody's feeling okay
You've_got to do
what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say now
You've_got to do
what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say now
You've_got to do
what you wanna do
Say what you wanna say now
Oh Mary was a maiden
When the birds began to sing
She was sweeter
than the blooming rose
So early in the spring
Her thoughts were gay and happy
And the morning gay and fine
For her lover was a river boy
From the river in the pines
Now Charlie he got married
To his Mary in the spring
When the trees were budding early
And the birds began to sing
But early in the autumn
When the fruit is in the wine
I'll return to you my darling
From the river in the pines
It_was early in the morning
In Wisconsin''s dreary clime
When he rode the fatal rapids
For that last and fatal time
They found his body lying
On the Rocky shore below
Where the silent water ripples
And the whispering cedars blow
Now every raft of lumber
that comes down the cheerful way
There's a lonely grave that's
visited by drivers on their way
They plant the wild flowers upon it
In the morning fair and fine
'Tis the grave of two young lovers
From the river in the pines
All that I know is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time with you
[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour, the color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
[Verse_2]
I used_to get sad and lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found in you
[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour, the color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
[Bridge]
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought_I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes, it looks like paradise
[Chorus]
You've set my world on_fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour, the color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour

Aw I think I got a bite
Love is an obsession that lives in my phone
When I let it die I know I'm alone
My real_life begins like a crack giving off some light
That feeling when you both dress up as monks
Orange and red, so we might burn the sun
I say "Georgia O'Keeffe" and you show me your teeth, all white
And they we walk through everybody's videos
And when we finally stop we're underneath a window
And someone's playing music
Someone's watching over us
And something 'bout this music reminds me of what has just gone past
That was today
Art is the way that we frame what we see
But these_days I crave anonymity
If you get that fame, don't you give it to me
Just give me what you say
And in these dying days of summertime
I think I know exactly what I
'Cause someone's playing music
Someone's watching over us
And something 'bout this music reminds me of what has just gone past
That was today
'Cause someone's playing music
Someone's watching over us
And something 'bout this music reminds me of what has just gone past
That was today
The sun is in your eyes
The sun is in your eyes
Throw me the cold
Throw me the cold
cold water of your smile again
To take me by_surprise
You take me by_surprise
Throw me the bold
Throw me the bold
bold treasure of your_lips again
And where I go
You lead me in the right direction
And with your love as my protection
I'll be a world of your projection
And where I go
Singing songs of your affection
With rhymes to your perfection
In my eyes see a reflection
Of you
I see you clearly now
I hold you dearly now
The sun is in my eyes
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like
they’re not shinin’
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She’s so beautiful and
I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her
she won’t believe me
And it’s so, it’s so
Sad to think that
she don’t see what I see
But every_time she_asks me,
“Do I look okay?”
I say
When I see your_face
There’s not a thing that
I would change
‘Cause you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The_whole world stops
and stares for a while
‘Cause girl you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Her lips, her lips,
I could kiss them all day
if she’d let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it’s so sexy
She’s so beautiful,
and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know
You know I’d never ask you to change
If perfect’s what you’re
searching for then just stay the same
So don’t even bother asking
if you look okay
You know I’ll say
When I see your_face
There’s not a thing that
I would change
‘Cause you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The_whole world stops
and stares for a while
‘Cause, girl, you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your_face
There’s not a thing that
I would change
‘Cause you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The_whole world stops and
stares for a while
‘Cause, girl, you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Just the way you are
Just the way you are
Yeah
Girl, you’re_amazing
Just the way you are
I said
oh my what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The_whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk
summer of '45
Picked me up late one night
Out the window we were seventeen
And crazy running wild wild
Can't remembеr what song
it was playing when we walked in
Thе night we snuck into a
Yacht club party pretending to
Be a duchess and a prince
And I said oh my
what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The_whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
He said Look_at you
Worrying too_much about things
you can't change
You'll spend your whole_life
singing the blues
if you keep thinking that way
He was trying
to skip rocks on the ocean
saying to me
Don't you see the starlight
starlight
Don't you dream_impossible
things
Like oh my what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The_whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Ooh_ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh_ooh dancing with me
Ooh_ooh we could get_married
Have ten kids and teach them
how to dream
Oh my what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The_whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing_dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
starlight
Like we dream_impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like we dream_impossible dreams
Don’t you see the starlight
starlight
Don't you dream_impossible things
I smell that salty breeze
blowing through the fjord
I hear those creaky ships
as old board meets old board
I breathe in the place
I live and wonder what else
can I give this home
My home
Wandering through the town
with everyone doing
all of their stuff
Somewhere in my heart
I feel I've not yet done enough
For these people I know
this place that I love so
My home
My home
I whistle as I walk
a lovely smell of kransekake
Wafting out of the baker’s door
The merchants haggling
over fish remind me
I have what I wish
'Cause I'm not alone anymore
I’m grateful for this castle
And for everything we've got
Especially my family
We've all been through a lot
I know how fragile things can be
If I lost them I'd lose me
They're my ocean they're my shore
I wanna give them more
They're my home
My home
Bless this happiness we found
Bless this good and solid ground
Our_home
Our_home
Our_home
Our_home
Our_home
Our_home
Our_home
Our_home
Our_home

What about your promises promises
What about your promises
promises promises No
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one
that got away yeah
Big mistake
you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call but I won't hear it
You said No one_else
How could you do this babe
What about your promises promises
You really blew this babe
We ain't getting
through this one babe
This_is the last time
I'll ever call you babe
This_is the last time
this is the last time
This_is the last time
I'll ever call you babe
What about your promises
promises promises
What a waste
Takin' down the pictures
and the plans we made yeah
And it's strange how your_face
doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence
and that's on you babe
I break down every_time you call
We're a wreck you're the wrecking ball
We said No one_else
How could you do this babe
What about your promises promises
You really blew this babe
We ain't getting through this one babe
This_is the last time
I'll ever call you babe
This_is the last time
this is the last time
This_is the last time I'll ever call you
Since you admitted it
I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck
I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you
I can't love you babe
What a shame didn't want
to be the one that got away
How could you do this babe
You really blew this babe
We ain't getting
through this one babe
This_is the last time
I'll ever call you babe
This_is the last time

I break down every_time you call
We're a wreck
you're the wrecking ball
You said No one_else
This_is the last time
I'll ever call you babe
I said remember this_moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our
shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced
like you knew our_lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It_was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long_live the walls
we crashed_through
How the kingdom_lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming_long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One_day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that
we stood there
On the side lines
wishing for right_now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your
baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we help them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming this is absurd
Cause for a moment a
band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to
rule the world
Long_live the walls
we crashed_through
How the kingdom_lights
shined just for me and you
I was screaming_long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long_live all the
mountains we_moved
I had the time of
my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming_long
live the look on your_face
And bring on all the pretenders
One_day we will be remembered
Hold on
Just spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Can you take a moment
promise me this
That you'll stand_by me forever
But if God forbid fate
should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please_tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds
went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long_live the walls
we crashed_through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we
crashed_through
How the kingdom_lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming_long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing long live all
the mountains we_moved
I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
Long long live the
look on your_face
And bring on all the pretenders
One_day we will be remembered
You have never been in love
Until you've seen the stars
reflect in the resevoirs
And you have never been in love
Until you've seen the dawn rise
behind the home for the blind
We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our street
where Hector
was the first of the gang
with a gun in his_hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die Oh my
Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his_hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die Oh my
You have never been in love
Until you've seen
the sunlight thrown
over smashed human bones
We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our street
where Hector
was the first of the gang
with a gun in his_hand
and the first to do time
the first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy
Hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his_hand
and a bullet in his gullet
and the first lost lad to go
under the sod
And he_stole from
the rich and the poor
and the not-very-rich
and the very poor
and he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
he_stole all hearts away
I don't know where to start
I don't want to say it
Cause I know
I'll break your heart
You know I can't love you
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be
I searched near and far
Got my waist in too deep
Did I have to try so hard
Just to find out what it means
I didn't want to hurt you
But it isn't what it seems
You deserve better_than me
You're a kind kind soul
For being patient with my
Cold cold heart
But in time I know
You'll find a good good heart
I don't know where to start
I don't want to say it and
I don't want to break your heart
I just can't love you
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be
The way that you deserve to be
The way you move is like a
full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the
kind_of reckless that should
send me running
But I kinda know that I
won't get far
And you stood there
in front_of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you
couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop_everything now
Meet me in the pouring_rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause' I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something_that'll
haunt me
when you're not around
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me
you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's
really something
You find I'm even better
than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the
rest_of the world
But with you
I know it's no good
And I could wait
patiently but
I really wish you would
Drop_everything now
Meet me in the pouring_rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something_that'll haunt
me when you're not around
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
I run my fingers through
your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your
eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make it
feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show
Drop_everything now
Meet me in the pouring_rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something_that'll haunt me
when you're
not around
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
When I was_born
I saw a rainbow
up in the sky
When I was_born
I saw a scarecrow
alone in the light
When I was_born
I was just child
When I was_born
I heard my mother cry
When I was_born
She was my friend
She was my friend
She was my friend
When I was young
I saw a rainbow
up in the sky
When I was young
I was a scapegoat
coat in the light
When I was young
I was afraid to die
When I was young
I heard my mother cry
When I was young
She was my friend
She was my friend
She was my friend
Winter came and went
She was still my friend
Even_though she have to go
in the end
Now that I'm here
She is a rainbow
up in the sky
Now that i'm here
she is a raincoat
keepin' me dry
Now that I'm here
I don't want to die
Now that I'm here
You never see me cry
Now that I'm here
She is my friend
She is my friend
She is my friend
I guess I'll take my time yeah
I'll take it slow
Don't want to lose
track of my steps
I think I made it too
far to lose control
And as her voice replays
inside my head
I heard my heartbeat
scream her name
We could try to recreate the art
but it'll never ever be the same
Why are these rain clouds
over my head
Can someone call the weatherman
tell him make it sunny
instead 'cause
I've_been thinking
I've_been wishing
I've_been wondering
Oh I've_been waiting_for you
to come home it's about that time
So I could reintroduce
your pretty eyes to mine
'Cause baby I've_been missing
your beautiful eyes
beautiful eyes
I don't understand love
baby I don't know
I try to sound it out
but the words don't go
And the lines just stay behind
'Til we press rewind and we
play it back again
So I made amends
so I can just pretend
That maybe someday
someday in the end
I will find my hands
wrapped in yours
But for now I'll ask myself
I'll ask myself
Why are these rain clouds
over my head
Can someone call the
weatherman tell him make it
sunny instead 'cause
I've_been thinking
I've_been wishing
I've_been wondering
Oh I've_been waiting_for you
to come home it's about that time
So I could reintroduce
your pretty eyes to mine
'Cause baby I've_been
missing your beautiful eyes
Baby I know this feeling
a little more_than I intend
Can I see you just one_more time
before you tell me
we're just friends
'Cause I was told
there were better things
But why were you in my dreams
Picture perfect as it seems
Why are these rain clouds
over my head
Can someone call the
weatherman tell him make it
sunny instead 'cause
I've_been thinking
I've_been wishing
I've_been wondering
Oh I've_been waiting_for you
to come home it's about that time
So I could reintroduce
your pretty eyes to mine
'Cause baby I've_been
missing your beautiful
beautiful eyes
Why are these rain clouds
over my head
Can someone call the
weatherman tell him make it
sunny instead 'cause
I've_been thinking
I've_been wishing
I've_been wondering
Oh I've_been waiting_for you
to come home it's about that time
So I could reintroduce
your pretty eyes to mine
'Cause baby I've_been
missing your beautiful eyes
Behind their smiles
Are tiny little crocodiles
Waiting to do do do me in
Beware of those
Who only can speak so sweet
Their words are like honey true
Dripping with bees
Your words are like
Windows without any screens
I will fall fall fall to my death
No one will ever hear me scream
Your kindness is obscene
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
Everything can't always be
As nice as you'd like to believe
We're not all actors here
And this is not your TV screen
So why am I forced to stand
Behind this green screen
And pretend that I do not see
The monster coming for me
I know that sounds so silly
so silly so crazy of me
But my imagination can't_help
But make you a little more scary
Than you ought to be
than you ought to be to me
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
I have known lots of people
like you in my life
I say good grief to you all I
don't like any sugar with my spice
Oh I'm so gracious
more_than I really should be
More gracious than any body's
ever been to me
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
Never_trust the nice_ones ohhhhh
The birds fly south
as the light leaves your eyes
Hold on to your dream
Oh, I know you wanna scream
Since the day you're born,
you're just a flower on your own
Waiting_for the sun to blossom
Hoping to break through the storm
Winter winds slightly
touching your soft skin
There's gotta be a brighter day
A summer breeze,
some silk and honey
A big white_horse is running
through the golden doors
You know you gotta take the ride
It's now or never by my side
Little Daisy, don't be shy
Nobody changes, they just lie
Take your own fate by the hand
It's time to conquer your own land
Little Daisy, don't be shy
Nobody changes, they just lie
Take your own fate by the hand
It's time to conquer your own land
I know I'm probably better off
on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know
what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage
you did to me
Never again I just wish I could forget
when it was magic
I wish it wasn't 4AM
standing in the mirror
Saying to myself
you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing
I ever did was run
Sometimes in the middle_of the night
I can feel you again
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say_goodbye
like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man
who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy
oh I can hear it now
Talking down to me like
I'd always be around
Push my love away like
it was some kind_of loaded gun
Oh you never thought_I'd run
Sometimes in the middle_of the night
I can feel you again
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say_goodbye
like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I hold_onto this pride
because these_days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and
we_both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've_been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah_yeah
Sometimes in the middle_of the night
I can feel you again
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say_goodbye
like the back of my hand
But I just miss you
and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Sometimes in the middle_of the night
I can feel you again
We might still be in love
if you were a better man
But I just miss you and I just wish you
were a better man
Yeah_yeah
I know why we had to say_goodbye
like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you
were a better man
A better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've_been the one
If you were a better man
Shorty trying to have a nice time
Slow down
Shorty looking_for a nice time
I was faded hella faded
Got me wobbled like a baby feeling wavy
I was headed to the party
Barely made it but I made it and when I made it
I was lifted second winded
They already_know the kid is like the pistons
I'm a bad boy hair looking like Malfoy leviosa osa
Put a spell on your girl like it's voodoo
So when you see her next time she be like who you
I'm not_sorry just came for the party
And I don't want to leave
I'm just looking_for a nice time
Love it or hate me
I'm just looking_for a good time
All faded
I'm so faded
But I love it love it yeah
I'm so faded
But I love it love it yeah
Like a politician kissing babies
Marmalade is what the name is
Like a politician kissing babies
I know I'm crazy hella crazy
I was out there getting flagrant and abrasive
Cause you know I got a loud mouth
And they know that I'm from down south
I was wasted and impatient
Took a little for the train to leave the station
It_was headed for a good time
Just looking_for a nice time
Put a spell on your girl like it's voodoo
So when you see her next time she be like who you
I'm not_sorry just came for the party
And I don't want to leave
I'm just looking_for a nice time
Love it or hate me
I'm just looking_for a good time
All faded

But I love it love it yeah
I'm so faded
But I love it love it yeah
I'm so faded
But I love it love it yeah
I'm so faded
But I love it love it yeah
It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It_feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost on your own
you're not alone
I will stand_by you
I will help you through
When you've_done all you can do
If you can't_cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part_of life
Oh it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh but when it_rains
I will stand_by you
I will help you through
When you've_done all you can do
And you can't_cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let you fall
Don't be afraid to fall

Yeah I know you can make it
Cause I will stand_by you
I will help you through
When you've_done all you can do
And you can't_cope
And I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
Oh I'm gonna hold you
And I won't let go
Won't let you go
No I won't
Hey, I wish you could see yourself, just sitting there on my chair
I'm staring_at you, you don't even notice
Should've told you straight away, you don't have to be afraid anymore
I know you would've noticed
You'll know
You'll know
That I won't let you go
Put your arms_around me and I'll let you know how it feels when time goes slow
And I won't let it rush when I see you dance and the moment comes when I fall and time goes slow
I fall_into you
I fall_into you
Hey, I wish I could show you more, 'cause baby you deserve some more, but still you're here and that's what I adore
Should've told you straight away, everything I had to say
But I'm afraid and I know you would've noticed
You'll know
You'll know
That I won't let you go
Put your arms_around me and I'll let you know how it feels when time goes slow
And I won't let it rush when I see you dance and the moment comes when I fall and time goes slow
I fall_into you
I fall_into you
I fall_into you
Couple in the next room
bound to win a prize
they've been going at it
all night long
Well I'm tryin' to get some sleep
but these motel walls are cheap
Lincoln Duncan is my name
and here's my song
here's my song
My_father was a fisherman
my mama was a fisherman's friend
and I was_born
in the boredom and the chowder
So when I reached my prime
I left my home in the Maritimes
headed down the turnpike for
New England
sweet New England
Holes in my confidence
holes in the knees of my jeans
I was left without a penny
in my pocket
Oooowee I was about
as destituted as a kid could be
and I wished I wore a ring
so I could hock it
I'd like to hock it
A young girl in a parkin' lot
was preaching to a crowd
singing sacred songs
and reading from the Bible
Well I told her I was lost
and she told all about the Pentecost
and I seen that girl
as the road to my survival
Just later on the very same night
when I crept to her
tent with a flashlight
and my long years
of innocence ended
well she took me to the woods
sayin' Here comes something
and it feels so good
and just like a dog
I was befriended
I was befriended
Oh_oh what a night
oh what a garden of delight
Even now that sweet memory lingers
I was playing my guitar
lyin' underneath the stars
just thankin' the Lord
for my fingers
for my fingers
Without giving anything away
I can say it's by the sea
It's a house that used_to be
the home of a friend of mine
Without giving anything away
you'll_find ships
inside of bottles
and the garden's over grown
the house is white
but the paint is coming of
I didn't know if you wanted to
when I came to pick you up
you didn't even hesitate
and now you and me are on our way
I think I've brought
everything we need
don't look back
don't think of the
other_places you should have been
it's a good thing
that you came along with me
Gold in the air of summer
you'll shine like gold
in the air of summer
you'll shine like gold
in the air of summer
you'll shine like gold
in the air of summer
Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose let it fall
Layin' soft up on my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning_light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't_care who's right or wrong
And i won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I remember tears
streaming down your_face
When I said
Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said
Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning_light
You and Ill be safe and sound
Dont you dare look out your window darling
Everythings on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the musics gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning_light
You and Ill be safe and sound
Just close your eyes
Youll be alright
Come morning_light
You and Ill be safe and sound
We've been to both Carolina's
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down
the coast a few times
London Paris paradise
But I ain't got much memory
of the scenes come to think
I miss them all every damn time
It's all your fault
No_matter where we go
No_matter what we do
If you're there girl
I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter_where we've_been
No there_ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Speaking of the coast
remember Pfeiffer beach
You and me that sunset
cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk_about
that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw
All I needed too
Might as well have stayed
in the room
No_matter where we go
No_matter what we do
If you're there girl
I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter_where we've_been
No there_ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Don't you remember Times Square
And people counting down
everywhere
2000 whatever no I didn't care
Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare
No_matter where we go
No_matter what we do
If you're there girl
I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter_where we've_been
No there_ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party any room
I'll be there all night
with my eyes on you
Don't matter_where we've_been
No there_ain't no better view
Than you in my arms
with my eyes on you
Where are you going? Where have you been?
When will I see your_face again?
I need to see those eyes once more
Come here and I'll unlock my door
[Verse_2]
I've never been perfect, I'm sure you can see
There's probably so_much wrong with me
Sometimes I think I'll disappear
But I keep on waiting till you're here
[Chorus]
Most my days I've wandered alone
Told myself I'd never find home
But I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you
I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you
[Verse_3]
I'll light a fire if you are cold
I'll keep you laughing when we're old
I know you've heard these_things before
But this time I hope you can't ignore that
[Chorus]
You and I have waited so long
Here with me is where you belong
'Cause I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you
I got this light inside and I'm saving it for you
[Bridge]
Remember the night I saw you
On the staircase dressed in white
Demanding the light as if I was called to you
Then you ran_off into the night
[Chorus]
So I kept your light inside and I'm saving it for you
I kept your light inside and I'm saving it for you
Come get your light, I've_been saving it for you
Come in love
This ain’t just common love
The stories they wrote for us
Are a thousand years old
Pick it up
The pen other lovers dropped
And color a page for us
Sincere as stone
Blur the edges
of the world you know
Fall into me let the spaces close
Whole
Tie them up
All of your broken chords
Cut by another’s words
It’s time to let it go
Fill your cup
Don’t give away too_much
It’s give and take with us
And here is home
Once a silhouette of all you are
Now the vacancy
inside my heart is whole
Take the time you
need to change and heal
Let me show you
you are made to feel whole
Whole
Taking in the motions
You were moving like a poet
I was falling I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
You were wading in the water
Dancing through your karma
I was falling I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
I was taking in the motions
You were moving like a poet
I was falling I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
Falling in we’re falling into chorus
Falling in we’re falling in
Falling in we’re falling in
Fever
You've_got fever
'Cause you had too_much fun
With someone who now is gone
and can't take care of you
Fever
You've_got fever
Driving around on your scooter
In Christmastime
with funky clothes
that don't take care of you
Now you feel warm and cold and
warm and cold warm
Warm and cold and
warm and cold warm
Fever
You've_got fever
A new time for taking care
Of that same one
who now is gone and
can´t take care of you
Fever
I've got fever too
Of a different kind
it makes me warm
It makes me crave
to be with you almost every
second of the day
And I feel warm and cold and
warm and cold warm
Warm and cold and
warm and cold warm
Come back now
even if you call me out
You might be angry now
of course you are
I'm scared to didn't_mean
to take it out on you
I know I always do
you're the strongest person
in the room
Turn back time
help me to rewind and we can
Find ourselves again
It's not too_late
Either way
I lose you in these silent days
It_wasn't right
But it was right on time
Don't look down
I can feel it
when your heart starts pounding
It's beyond your control
you know it is
It's getting to the point
where I can't carry on
I never held my breath
for quite this long
And I don't take it back
I did what I had to do
It's not too_late
Either way
I lose you in these silent days
It_wasn't right
But it was right on time
It's not too_late
Either way
I lose you in these silent days
It_wasn't right
But it was right on time
Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"
Black and white, saw a '30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each_other
In another life, you still_would've turned my head even if wе'd met
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still_would've been mine
We would have been_timeless
I would've read your love letters every_single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've_been fine
We would have been_timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still_would've been mine
We would've_been timeless
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first_time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first_saw your_face
In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still_would've been mine
We would have been_timeless
I would've read your love letters every_single night
And run_away and left it all behind
You still_would've been mine
We would've_been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still_would've been mine
We would've_been timeless
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It_was like an age-old classic
The first_time that you saw me
The story started when you said, "Hello"
In a crowded_room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's_no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' grey
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still_would've been mine
We would've_been
Even_if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still_would've been mine
We would've_been
Down the block, there's an antique shop
And somethin' in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
I used_to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"
I used_to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an_empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So_many things that I wish you knew
So_many walls up I can't break through
Now I'm standing_alone In a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's_killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist_of fate
When it all broke_down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy_now next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're_doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing_alone in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's_killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist_of fate
When it all broke_down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy_now
This_is looking like a contest
Of who can act_like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So_many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing_alone in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's_killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist_of fate
When it all broke_down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end
Breaking my back
in the heart of this land
Feet above water
and softened in sand
I could have wanted any part_of this
But I find the heat is too
harsh on the skin
Drowning_in light need
the cold to sink into my soul
My soul
Ignore signs of change no more
I come_back again I am flawed
Swallow me whole
with the moon on my back
One side is pink
and the other is black
I'm good at hiding
in the dead and grey
But time after time
I've_been people I'm not
Places we go to
are all that we've got
So why don't we go
So why don't we go
I'll never know
Ignore signs of change no more
I come_back again I am flawed
Torn down full_of aching
Somehow our youth would
take the blame
Worn out the way we let it stay
Taught how to celebrate it
All out I'd replicate your pain
Climb down if only for a taste
Hallowed but hesitated
Shallow
but full in all your veins
Shadowed by every other weight
Hollow a doubt can make it
Borrowed a love that never came
Followed in every other shade
Let it lead your love away
I never strayed
Let it bury you away
In all your blame
in all your pain
I will carry you always
Let it lead your love away
I never strayed
Let it bury you away
Fade me away
I won't ever be the same
Fade me away
I won't ever be the same
Fade me away
I won't ever be the same
Oh you were my hurricane
'Cause in your eyes I felt so safe
And in them
I found shelter_from the storm
The rain would pour
the waves would break
And in my lowest
coldest place
You were always
there to keep me warm
And even when the wind
would roar
You were such a perfect storm
And even when you left me
broke and cold
There_is nothing I want more
Oh you were my hurricane
'Cause somehow the more
time you stayed
The damage just kept getting
worse and worse
While power lines
were breaking free
The maelstrom started shaking me
The scars that you would
leave began to hurt
And even when the wind would roar
You were such a perfect storm
And even when you left me
broke and cold
There_is nothing I want more
Oh you were my hurricane
'Cause when you finally dissipated
There was nothing_left of both of us
The sea was still the sky was grey
But now with no more hurricane
There was nothing_left
for me to run from
And even when the wind would roar
You were such a perfect storm
And even when you left me
broke and cold
There_is nothing I want more
Yeah even when you left me
broke and cold
There_is nothing I want more
I’ve got scars on my wrist
from where I used_to cut
I didn’t wanna live
but I still wanted love
Oh, she kept me around
for a little while longer
Just a man in his head to
afraid to commit
But a little drop of blood helped
him not to forget that he might
wanna stay for a little while longer
And all these streams down your cheeks
I can see that your insides dying,
less time smiling more time crying
I know you want this to be over
I can see that your heartbeats shaking,
I know it’s hard if I’m not mistaken
I know you want to try,
to try to love life
Again
Oh, the fuel that keeps me driving
are my flesh and my bones
But now those are growing scarce
since I used up my soul
Oh, she kept me around
for a little while longer
I ran around with strangers
and I tried to be fun
But, even when surrounded I still
feel numb all the time
I can see that your insides dying,
less time smiling more time crying
I know you want this to be over
I can see that your heartbeats shaking,
I know it’s hard if I’m not mistaken
I know you want to try,
to try to love life
Oh, I just need someone to
hear me when I call
Though I am screaming next to-
You don’t hear me at all
Are you listening at all?
Are you listening at all?
I can see that your insides dying,
less time smiling more time crying
I know you want this to be over
I can see that your heartbeats shaking,
I know it’s hard if I’m not mistaken
I know you want to try,
to try to love life
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol
I line ‘em up and I drink ‘em all,
I lost the one I need something strong
Just to get me thru the pain that i’m feeling,
I'm goin’ in like a wrecking ball,
Don't hit me up, I'll be missing calls,
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol,
Baby it’s gon be one hell of a weekend
I had a hundred one-nights none like you and me,
And I drink but that don’t bring back a summer I can’t repeat,
Lately I can’t even smoke something,
Gives me anxiety,
It'll turn on all the floodlights hanging over memories
Back when we almost had it all but you ain’t reminiscing If there’s someone_else you’re kissin
All we had is gone
Like I’m about to be, bout to be
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol
I line ‘em up and I drink ‘em all,
I lost the one I need something strong
Just to get me thru the pain that i’m feeling,
I'm goin’ in like a wrecking ball,
Don't hit me up, I'll be missing calls,
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol,
Baby it’s gon be one hell of a weekend
I'm gettin some advice I know I shouldn’t listen to,
Cause I wanna make you miss me more_than I’m missin you,
Got trouble on my arm, I ain’t even tryna hide it,
So it gets back to you and then you’ll be reminded,
Of when we almost had it all
But you ain’t reminiscing
If there’s someone_else you’re kissin
All we had is gone like I’m about to be, bout to be
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol
I line ‘em up and I drink ‘em all,
I lost the one I need something strong
Just to get me thru the pain that i’m feeling,
I'm goin’ in like a wrecking ball,
Don't hit me up, I'll be missing calls,
I'm on that heartbreak and alcohol,
Baby it’s gon be one hell of a weekend
Sunny_came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny_came home with a mission
She says days
go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly
out of my mind
Into the fire
Sunny_came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few
small repairs she said
Sunny_came home with a vengeance
She says days
go by I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly
out of my mind
Into the fire
Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years you always knew it
Strike a match go on and do it
Days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly
out of my mind
Into the fire
Light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own
and she's alright
Sunny_came home
Sunny_came home
Well I'll be damned
Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall
As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what
memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed
Now I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there
Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of
that vagueness now
It's all come_back too clearly
Yes I loved you dearly
And if you're offering me
diamonds and rust
I've already paid
Summerchild that sits
by the water
weaving sunlight threads in
his hands
The golden river that
day a shelter
a stream where he could
make pebbles dance
You looked around you
nobody had taken
any notice of what you saw
Against the evening
sky a formation
a million black birds
looking like one
Live long save ten_years
to remember
live long hold it in front_of
your eyes once more
Live long save ten_years
to remember
live long hold it in front_of
your eyes
Don't worry 'bout me, it's all over now
Though I may be blue, I'll manage somehow.
Love can't be explained, can't be controlled
One_day it's warm, next day it's cold.
Don't pity me 'cause I'm feelin' blue;
Don't be ashamed, it might have been you.
Oh-oh-oh, oh, love,
Kiss me one time, then go, love,
I understand, don't worry 'bout me.
Sweet, sweet, sweet love, I want you to be
As happy as I when you loved me.
I'll never forget you, your sweet memory
It's all over now, don't worry 'bout me.
When one heart tells one heart, one heart good-bye,
One heart is free; one heart will cry.
Oh-oh-oh, oh, sweet, sweet baby, sweet baby, sweet,
It's all right, don't worry 'bout me.
God stood me up
And I don't know why
Lights are on
But nobody's home
There_ain't no love like our love
There_ain't no love like our love
Like our love
love love love love
Let the last ones go
And roll in tonight
Don't wake us up
We got nothing for you
There_ain't no love like our love
There_ain't no love like our love
Like our love
love love love love
Build us a dome
And rest here with me
Lights are on
But nobody's home
There_ain't no love like our love
There_ain't no love like our love
Nothing ever felt as good
Or as easy, as when we were young oh
Though I felt misunderstood
It_was a pleasure
Running away with you
We were just children, acting like adults, crazy_naive bold and carefree
We were kids having kids, crazy_naive it amazes me
That we didn't fall apart, harder than we did
Now they keep us on speaking terms
We grow and we learn, I have no_regrets only forgets
A big thank you to life, for giving us sand
When the timing's right there's_no wasteland
We were just children, acting like adults, crazy_naive bold and carefree
We were kids having kids, crazy_naive it amazes me
That we didn't fall apart, harder than we did
Life keeps on moving
Life goes on changing
We were just children, acting like adults, crazy_naive bold and carefree
We were kids having kids, crazy_naive it amazes me
That we didn't fall apart, harder than we did
Now go stand in the corner and think_about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him_faster than you could say_sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's_an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she_does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing I do better_than revenge, ha
She_looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She_looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no_amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's_an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she_does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing I do better_than revenge, ha
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's_an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she_does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing I do better_than revenge, ha
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do,_oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're_doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how_much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so_much better
She took him_faster than you could say_sabotage
Walking Scott Street
feeling like a stranger
With an open heart
open container
I've got a stack
of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer
it's a payment plan
There's helicopters
over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely
that's when I'll burn it
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name
I asked you
How is your sister I heard
she got her degree
And I said
That makes me feel old
He said What does that make me
I asked you
How is playing drums
You said it's too
much shit to carry
And what about the band
You said they're
all getting married
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name
Anyway don't leave a stranger
Anyway don't leave a stranger
Don't be a stranger
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me
wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about
their vacant stares
But right_now my time is theirs
Seems_like there's always
someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like
they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from
those with nothing_else to do
The jury's out
but my choice is you
So don't you worry your
pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at
things that shine
and life makes love look hard
The_stakes are high
the water's_rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people
have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna
jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with
their lipgloss smiles
But I don't_care
Cause right_now you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your
pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at
things that shine
and life makes love look hard
The_stakes are high
the water's_rough
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate
if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough but
they are where mine belong in
I'll fight their doubt
and give you faith
with this song for you
Cause I love the gap
between your teeth
and I love the riddles
that you speak
And any snide remarks
from my father about your
tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours
So don't your worry your
pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at
things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your
pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at
things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The_stakes are high
the water's_rough
But this love is ours
I don’t remember
much about last_night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living_room
through these bloodshot
eyes of my mine
cold sober
You didn’t like
that I come home late
4am but it’s a Friday babe
And I’ve_been working hard
Can’t you give me some space
steada shoutin out
Oh my God
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me
miss you more
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
And I keep second_guessing
Where_did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve_had one too_many
Come take me home
Now I’m the one that’s crying
I didn’t wanna call
cos I didn’t wanna fight
I swear that I was trying
But everybody falls
when their head’s a little high
And I never meant to get
so out my mind
With you playing cool
just pretending it’s fine
Oh we’ve been ‘round ‘round
‘round this
Too_many times before
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me
miss you more more
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
And I keep second_guessing
Where_did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve_had one too_many
Come take me home
I don’t know how_lucky
how_lucky I am I am I am no
I guess sometimes
I should give more
of a damn a damn a damn
about you
I don’t know how_lucky
how_lucky I am I am I am no
I know we’re_both stubborn
Push each other’s buttons
I’d rather do it with you but
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
And I keep second_guessing
Where_did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve_had one too_many
Come take me home
Come take me home
Yeah I’ve_had one too_many
Ayy
My girl is bangin'
She's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne
poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's
Can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries
in her Frosty
But every now
and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby
with an upgrade ayy Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, we fancy_like Applebee's
on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak
with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream
on the top too
Two straws, one check, girl,
I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeak-squeakin'
in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama-jamma,
she my Dixieland delight
Ayy, that's how we do,
how we do,_fancy like, oh
Fancy like, oh
Fancy like, oh
Fancy like, oh
Uh, don't need no Tesla

My girl is happy rollin'
on a Vespa there she go
Don't need no mansion

She's super fine, double wide,
slow dancin' slow dancin'
But every now
and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby
with an upgrade
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, we fancy_like Applebee's

Got that Bourbon Street steak

Get some whipped cream

My new, clean blue jeans
without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips
without Skoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be

Maybe a little Maybelline

In the kitchen light radio

Boxed wine and her up-do goes down
Ayy

on a date night that's right
Got that Bourbon Street steak
with the Oreo shake ayy
Get some whipped cream

Some Alabama-jamma,
she my Dixieland delight
Ayy, that's how we do,
how we do,_fancy like
I've got nothing to say to you
I've got to look ahead
That love that I once felt for you
Is by now as good as dead
No I'm not fooling anyone
And least of all myself
I still believe that you will come
And take me back again
What good is it to comb my hair
It won't be touched by you
Why wake_up when you won't be there
Why go outside It's lonely there
The sky is full_of stars tonight
The air is warm and clear
That silence that I longed to find
Is cold and senseless now
Almost Heaven, West_Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains,
Shenandoah River
Life_is old there,
older than the trees
Younger than the mountains,
growing like a breeze
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain_mama
Take me home,_country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine,
teardrop in my eye
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain_mama
Take me home,_country roads
Oh, take me home
I hear her voice in the morning hour,
she_calls me
The radio reminds me
of my home far_away
Driving down the road,
I get a feeling
That I should have been
home yesterday, yesterday
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain_mama
Take me home,_country roads
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain_mama
Take me home
Take me home,_country roads
Oh, country roads,_take me home
Oh, country roads,_take me home
Met him at a party,
accidentally brushed his body
On the way to get a drink at the bar
I couldn't wait 'til later,
talking in the elevator
Then we're kissing in the back of the car
That voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't see the way
you're looking at me right_now
It may_not be next week, what I need
Then again, maybe it might be
Could be forever or we might break
That's_just the kind_of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first
I gotta_have ya, gotta see if this works
I gotta_have ya, wake_up in your t-shirt
Who_knows what'll happen,
ain't that always kinda magic
When you don't know
who's holding the cards
Could be a wish I never knew ya
or permanently tattoo ya
Only the moon knows
what's in the stars (what's in the stars)
Mm, that voice in my head
says to slow down
But it can't feel your hands
on my hips right_now
It may_not be next year, what I need
Then again, maybe it might be
Could be forever or we might break
That's_just the kind_of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first
I gotta_have ya, gotta see if this works
(I gotta_have ya)
I gotta_have ya, wake_up in your t-shirt
I gotta_have ya, diving in heart first
(Heart first)
I gotta_have ya
Ooh, I gotta_have ya
And I can't even stop myself anymore
(Ooh, I gotta_have ya)
Oh, we couldn't end the perfect night
outside my front_door
Could be forever or we might break
That's_just the kind_of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first
I gotta_have ya, gotta see if this works
(I gotta_have ya)
I gotta_have ya, wake_up in your t-shirt
(Wake up in your t-shirt, yeah)
I gotta_have ya, diving in heart first
(Diving in heart first)
I gotta_have ya
Yeah, I gotta_have ya
The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me
is my Mama and Papa
And down the road I look
and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch
the green_green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me
Arms are reaching
smiling sweetly
It's good to touch
the green_green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Tho' the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old_oak tree
that I used_to play on
Down the lane I walk
with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch
the green_green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me
Arms are reaching
smiling sweetly
It's good to touch
the green_green grass of home
Then I awake
and look around me
At four grey walls
that surround me
And I realize
that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard
and there's a sad old Padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch
the green_green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old_oak tree
As they lay me'neath
the green_green grass of home
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling thru
this world of woe
Yet there's_no sickness
toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark_clouds
will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields
lie just before me
Where God's redeemed
their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my mother
She_said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
Some_people run
Some_people crawl
Some_people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forward
Some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in white
Some wrapped in fearful black
Some_people never get
And some never give
Some_people never die
But some never live
Some folks they treat me mean
Some treat me kind
But most folks just go their way
Don't pay me no mind
Time oh good good time
Where_did you go
Time oh good good time
Where_did you go
Sometimes I'm satisfied
Sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold
Sometimes it's hot
At sunset I laugh
But at sunrise I cry
At midnight I'm in between
And wondering why
Time oh good good time
Where_did you go
Time oh good good time
Where_did you go
Crossroads and given the option
To pass and look back
at goals I`ve missed
Rainbows or burning bridges
If you squint a little more
it looks the same
But oh
There`s a little_bit of me inside you
Gathering what you`ve lost
But oh
There`s a little_bit of you in everyone
Can never keep a secret
Problem lines on your_face
You smooth them out
so no_one can tell
put a straight back upon a stage
could dance dance
hide the tremor in your hand
But oh
There`s a little_bit of me inside you
Gathering what you`ve lost
But oh
There`s a little_bit of you in everyone
And I`m watching you now
I see you building the castle
with one hand
while tearing down another
with the other
And I`m watching you now
I see you building the castle
with one hand
while tearing down another
with the other
And I`m watching you now
I see you building the castle
with one hand
while tearing down another
with the other
"When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, to see you again
Winter,_spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've_got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full_of clouds
And that old north_wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out_loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter,_spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there yes I will
Ain't it good to know that you've_got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, desert you
And take your soul if you let them, don't you let_them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running running running to see you again
Winter,_spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend
Ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend

I had a way with words for a while
You call it substance over style
Now I hear laugh
but I don't see a smile
I had a way with words for a while
If I had've known
I would've stuck around
'Cause what kinda man
lets his brother down
Oh while I was gone think_about
all that you found
A dear old friend
and a brand_new sound
I am one man
I can do_anything
We are not far
We can do_anything
Is the whole thing just a test
Is there something
you should get off your chest
Don't keep me waiting on some SMS
Don't keep it all so close to the vest
I am one man
I can do_anything
We are not far
We can do_anything
Our return will come some day
The three of us will laugh and play
I know that we can find a way
Put it all behind us
Nothing to remind us
To put it all behind us
There'll_be nothing to remind us
Won't hold my breath
won't wait in vain
Won't single you out
won't lay blame
I won't protest
but I won't be the same
'Cause I'm the only one
who has my name
I am one man
I can do_anything
We are not far
We can do_anything
One man
I can do_anything
We are not far
We can do_anything
Do anything
I am one man
I was just coastin'
never really goin anywhere
Caught up in a web
I was gettin' kinda
used_to stayin' there
And out of the blue
I fell for you
Now you're lifting me
up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead
of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round
my wings that were tied
I didn't know him
and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always
out of reach
Now I remember what it
feels_like to fly
You give me butterflies
Kiss full_of color makes me
wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you
brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
all_because of you
And now you're lifting me
up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead
of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round
my wings that were tied
I didn't know him
and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always
out of reach
Now I remember what it
feels_like to fly
You give me butterflies yeah
You give me butterflies
Now you're lifting me up 'stead
of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead
of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round
my wings that were tied
I didn't know him
and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always
out of reach
Now I remember what it
feels_like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Your hair's a little longer Uh-huh
How_long will you be back
in town Uh-huh
Are you still drinking that Jack
and water Uh-huh
Why don't you let me
buy you this next round
I can feel my heart beating
faster every_time you get close
I can pick you out of a lineup,
baby, even with my eyes closed
Oh, something
I can't control comes over me
My hands know just where to be
It's_muscle memory
And yeah, my body
won't forget our history
We fall back so easily
It's_muscle memory, uh-huh_Uh-huh
When it comes to you and me,

I know just what you need, uh-huh
Do you still got that
Silverado Uh-huh
For old time's sake,

Tonight is already on autopilot, baby
Let's ride the long way home tonight
That's right
Every_little thing comin' out
of your mouth,
I like how it sounds
We've set it in motion
and there_ain't no slowin' it,
even if we tried now
Oh, something
I can't control comes over me
My hands know just where to be
It's_muscle memory
And yeah,

Your hair's a little longer, mm
How_long will you be back in town
Jump on outta bed
and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch
and try to come to life
Jump in the shower
and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street
the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me
on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5
what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
crazy if you let it
9 to 5 for service and devotion
You would think that I would
deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead
but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that
man is out to get me
They let you dream
just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step
on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams
he'll never take away
You're in the same
boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day
your ship'll come in
'n' the tide's gonna turn
and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5
what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive
you crazy if you let it
9 to 5 yeah they
got you where they want you
There's a better life
and you dream
about it don't you
It's a rich man's game
no matter_what they call it
And you spend your life
puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5 whoa
what a way to make a livin'
'stead-a gettin' by
it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive
you crazy if you let it
9 to 5 yeah they done got you
where they want you
FADE
There's a better life
and you dream about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter
what they call it
3 AM and I'm still awake
I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city
that's better_than mine
And the girl in your bed
has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you
she's better_than me huh
Well I tried to fit in
with your upper-crust circles
Yeah they let me sit in back
when we were in love
Oh they sit around talkin'
about the meaning of life
And the book that just
saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder
to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think_about me
You grew_up
in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous shiny
bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm
no it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin'
and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
you can't_help who you fall for
And you and I fell like
an early spring snow
But reality crept in
you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams
rolled your eyes at my jokes
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all
the space that you need
I don't have to be your shrink
to know that you'll_never be happy
And I bet you think_about me
I bet you think_about me yes
I bet you think_about me
Oh block it all out
The voices so loud sayin'
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had
Now you're out in the world
searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip
scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status
last time you felt free
Was when none_of that
shit mattered 'cause you were with me
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
That it turned out I'm harder
to forget than I was to leave
And yeah I bet you think_about me
I bet you think_about me yes
I bet you think_about me
I bet you think_about me
when you're out
At your cool indie music
concerts every week
I bet you think_about me in your house
With your organic shoes
and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think_about me when you say
Oh my god she's insane
she wrote a song about me
I bet you think_about me
And here's to you, Mrs._Robinson
Jesus_loves you more_than
you will know (Wo,_wo, wo)
God_bless you please,_Mrs. Robinson
Heaven_holds a place for those
who_pray
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
We'd like to know a little_bit
about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to
help yourself
Look around you,
all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds
until you feel at home
And here's to you, Mrs._Robinson
Jesus_loves you more_than
you will know (Wo,_wo, wo)
God_bless you please,_Mrs. Robinson
Heaven_holds a place for those_who pray
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
Hide it in a hiding place
where no_one ever goes
Put it in your pantry
with your cupcakes
It's a little secret,
just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've_got to hide it from the kids
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs_Robinson
Jesus_loves you more_than
you will know (Wo,_wo, wo)
God_bless you please,_Mrs. Robinson
Heaven_holds a place for those_who pray
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've_got to choose
Ev'ry way you look_at it, you lose
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
(Woo, woo, woo)
What's that you say, Mrs._Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music used_to make me
smile
And I knew if I had my chance
that I could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver with every paper I'd
daliver
Bad news on the doorstap
I couldn't take one_more step
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his
widowed bride
Something touched me deep_inside the day the music
died.So bye_bye Miss_American pie
Drove_my Chevy to the levee but the levee_was dry
Them_good ole_boys were_drinkin' whisky_ane rye
singin'_this'll be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
This'll_be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love and
do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rook and roll
can Music save your mortal soul and
can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well I know that you're in love with him
cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shose
Man, I dig those rhythm and bluses
I was a lonely teenage broncin's buck
with a pink_carnation and a pickup_truck
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music_died.
I started singing bye_bye
Now for ten_years we've_been on our own
and moss grows fat on a rollin's stone
But that's not how it used_to be
When the Jester sang for the king and Queen in a coat
He Borrowned from James Dean and a voice that came
from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down the Jester
stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
And while Lennin read a book on Marx
the coart took practice in the park and we SONG
dirties in the dark
the day the music_died. We were singin's_bye bye
Helter-skelter in the summer sweiter
the birds flew off with a fall-out shelter
Eight miles high and fallin's fast, it landed foul on
the gress
the players tried for a forware pass,
with the Jester on the sidelines in a coat
Now the half-time air was sweet paerfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance but we never got the chance
Cause the players tried to take the field,
the marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music_died
We started singin's_bye bye
In there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space with no time left to start
again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack sat on a candlestick cause fire is the devils
only friend
(Oh) as I watched him on the stage,
my hands were clenched in festive rage
No angel born in heaven could break that stan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
the sacrificial rite I saw satan
Laughing with delight the day the music_died.
He was singin's_bye byeI met girl who sang the blues and I asked her for
some happy news
but the just smiled and turned away I went down to
the sacred store
where I heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
The lovers cried and the posts dreamed
(But) Not a word was spoken, the church_bells all
were broken
And he three man I admire most the Father,
Son an the holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music_died.
And they were singin' bye_bye
Sun rays come down as seen
when they hit the ground
Children spinning around till
they fall down down down
I wait for you
it's been two hours now
You're_still somewhere in town
Your dinners getting cold
i rest my case
you are always this late
And you know how_much i hate
waiting arond round round
Bitter_heart bitter heart tries to
keep it all inside
Bitter_heart bitter haert shadows
will help you try to hide
Bitter_heart my bitter heart
is gettin just a little fragile
Bitter_heart bitter heart of mine
And then you come
and tell me the same reason
as you did yesterday
So tell me whats her name
Bitter_heart bitter heart tries to
keep it all inside
Bitter_heart bitter haert shadows
will help you try to hide
Bitter_heart my bitter heart
is gettin just a little fragile
Bitter_heart bitter heart of mine
of mine of mine of mine
of mine of mine
In this autumn town
where the leaves can fall
On either side of the garden wall
We laugh all night
to keep the embers blowing
Some are leaping free
from their moving cars
Stacking stones
'round their broken_hearts
Waving down any wind
that might come blowing
Ice move out when the field is cut
Serpents curl
when the sun comes up
Songbirds only end up
where they're going
Some get rain and some get snow
Some want love and some want gold
I just want to see you
in the morning
Dogs lay down in the evening heat
Fish do worse
when they leave the sea
Songbirds only end up
where they're going
In this autumn town
where the lights can change
Some get mercy and some get blamed
Some get lost
when they feel the river flowing
It's all holy smoke
and the flame dies fast
We hold our hats
while the days fly past
Cold wind comes and we wait
but it keeps going
Father Sons and Holy Ghosts
All come_back
or they all come close
Songbirds only end up
where they're going
Some get hard and some go home
Some want flesh and some want bone
I just want to see you
in the morning
Yeah I just want to see you
in the morning
You've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
from your nice warm bed
You just remember
what your old pal said
Boy you've_got a friend in me
Yeah you've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
You've_got troubles
and I've got 'em too
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you
We stick together
and we see it through
'Cause you've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
Some other folks might
be a little_bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too maybe
But none_of them will ever
love you the way I do
It's me and you boy
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
Bad blood living in the city
It’s okay I know that you miss me
You “meant well”
What the hell_does that mean anyway
In the attic I keep all our sweet memories
And forgotten dreams
Now we’re collecting dust in a pile of stuff
That means everything
You meant everything to me
Oh
Now we got bad blood living in the city
It’s okay, I know that you miss me
You “meant well”
What the hell_does that mean anyway, anyway
Now you found someone and she looks like me
At_least that’s what I choose to believe
If I saw you with her at the reservoir
She’d have that look like you had hung the stars
All the times I held you up so high
You’ll never say it
But you know I’m right, we got
Bad blood living in the city
It’s okay, I know that you miss me
You “meant well”
What the hell_does that mean anyway, anyway
You know we got
Bad blood (bad blood)
You know that it’s all true, love (true, love)
And now that we got bad blood (bad blood)
I know it wasn’t true love (true love, true love)
I don’t want
Bad blood, living in the city
It’s okay, you don’t have to miss me
Oh well, I don’t wanna dwell on it
Anymore, anyway
But I gotta say it’s
True, love
You didn’t deserve me
Don’t say you don’t know how you hurt me
You meant well
What the hell_does that mean anyway anyway
You know that we got
Bad blood (bad blood)
You know that it’s all true, love (true, love)
And now that we got bad blood (bad blood)
I know it wasn’t true love (true love, true love)
In the end all I have are some pictures saved
They mean everything
But they won’t someday
Why does the sun rise to set again?
Why do leaves grow and fall by autumn’s end?
Why do friends grow apart with no_one to blame?
Why is it hard to change?
Why do flowers bloom only to die someday?
Why does snow become rain in May?
Why did I choose to run away?
You told me I should stay
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Who_knows if I’ll see you again
But for now I know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Why do roads cross only to part again?
Why do we leave so_many things unsaid?
Why do we have to say farewell?
I guess only time will tell
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Who_knows if I’ll see you again
But for now we_both know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Sometimes when I’m looking up at the moon
I’ll wonder_if you see it, too
If you don’t_forget me, I won’t forget you
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
I hope that I’ll see you again
But for now I know that this is the end
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
Goodbye and godspeed my friend
They tell you while you're young
Girls go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones
Who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say
She_looks like she's been through it
Lord what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty
I've had too_much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad
but this is what I think_about
And I wake_up
in the middle_of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person
know everything at 18
But nothing at 22
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new
How_long will it be cute
All this crying in my room
When you can't blame
it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking_smiles
Are we only biding time
till I lose your attention
And someone_else lights up the room
People love an ingenue
I've had too_much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up
to breaking down
And I wake_up in the middle_of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person
know everything at 18
But nothing at 22
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new
I know someday
I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind_of radiance
you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and
then she'll say she
got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her
then I'll cry myself to sleep
I've had too_much to drink tonight
But I wonder_if they'll
miss me once they drive me out
I wake_up in the middle_of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person
know everything at 18
But nothing at 22
And will you still want me
Will you still want me
Will you still want me
When I'm nothing new
He won't touch you anymore
Staying inside
Half indifferent half afraid
It will only make you cry
What is given can't be returned
The cards are in our hands
All that is living can be hurt
And that's the end of innocence
Second round found you
beating death
The miracle of life
Once each of you
caught your breath
A question simmers inside
How_far away_from being in
Can there be stated of love
How to put it is
you're bound within
What matter is it made of
What will we become
What will we become
What will we become
Second to numb
Another day another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated
Do you ever wonder
if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles_away
And yesterday
you were here with me
Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your_face
It's complicated
Is it that it's over
or do birds still sing for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles_away
And yesterday
you were here with me
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song
that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I I miss you
and I wish you'd stay
Do you ever wonder
if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles_away
And yesterday
you were here with me
Ooh oh ooh oh
Ooh oh ooh oh
Touch down
Like a seven four seven
Stay out
and we'll live forever now
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore.
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin'_on heaven's door.
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel I'm knockin'_on heaven's door.
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Knock,_knock, knockin'_on heaven's_door
Broken feather made me cry
Lost and wounded I realised lies
We don't need, no_one to wither us away
Sit still tree, gently sway
Broken feather scattered down from the sky
Hoping with her, we all need sacrifice from our ways
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
Open windows, set the sail beneath my wings
We are the light that we are glowing in
She kissed my lips as_fast as the wind
You and I, queens and kings
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
We are the sky,_We are the Ocean
I'm laughin' I'm dancin'
On tables wearin' sunglasses
Fantastic yeah I'm killin' it
I'm faded I'm takin'
More shots tequila and Jameson
I'm famous yeah I'm killin' it
It's 3 A.M. still goin' strong
Not goin' home no
Look_at me
I'm the life of the party
'Round here everybody loves me
But they don't know
that I've_been hurtin'
'Cause baby
ever since you left me
I've_been the life of the party
Yeah I'm the life of the party
I'm drinkin' my feelings
'Cause Lord knows that I need it
Repeatin' this whole thing
every night
I'm happy I promise
Could care less if you call me
Honestly I swear I'm doin' fine
It's 3 A.M. still goin' strong
Not goin' home no
Look_at me
I'm the life of the party
'Round here everybody loves me
But they don't know
that I've_been hurtin'
'Cause baby
ever since you left me
I've_been the life of the party
Yeah I'm the life of the party
If only you could see me now
I'm goin' hard I shut it down
I'm better that you're not around
If only you could see me now
I'm goin' hard I shut it down
I'm better that you're not around
At_least that's what I tell myself
I'm the life of the party
'Round here everybody loves me
But they don't know
that I've_been hurtin'
'Cause baby
ever since you left me
I've_been the life of the party
Yeah I'm the life of the party
Yeah I'm the life of the party
Yeah I'm the life of the party
I've_been chasing the pavement
I've_been sleeping with strangers
Dealing in danger
Passing by faces so cold
I've_been running to places
I've_been broken and nameless
Hopeless and shamed
I've never been so low
Zoom out to everything
Zoom into me
Zoom out to tragedy
Zoom into me
Can you hear me out there
Can you help me I'm scared
Can you lift me
can you give me a sign
Can you beat back the night
Can you make things alright
Can you hold me
can you show me the light
All alone in the basement
Where it's always the same and
Nothing can change and
no_one can see me cry
I don't know how to face it
I don't know how to name it
know who to blame
But nothing seems alright
Zoom out to everything
Zoom into me
Zoom out to tragedy
Zoom in to me
Can you hear me out there
Can you help me I'm scared
Can you lift me
can you give me a sign
Can you beat back the night
Can you make things alright
Can you hold me
can you show me the light
Mmmm mmmm
Mmmm mmmm
Can you hear me out there
Can you help me I'm scared
Can you lift me
can you give me a sign
Can you beat back the night
Can you make things alright
Can you hold me
can you show me the light
These past_few years
I’ve fought the weather
and everything I can’t control
These past_few months
I’ve felt a pressure
That I’ve never known
I cant help but think
that I might need a change of mind
If I want to live this life
instead of wasting my own time
Lately I’ve_been changing things
My priorities
For the better
Getting my toes on a beach
Where service don’t reach
With my lover
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
We’re headed for
better day, day, days
Deleted my social media
Nearly threw out my phone
Tired of looking_for the answers
In the wrong scroll
I don’t want to medicate
There must be a way
To remember all the colors
Before the world went gray
Lately I’ve_been changing things
My priorities
For the better
Getting my toes on a beach
Where service don’t reach
With my lover
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
We’re headed for better day, day, days
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
I can see it in your face, face, face
Lately I’ve_been changing things
My priorities
For the better
Getting my toes on a beach
Where service don’t reach
With my lover
I can feel it in the way, way, waves
We’re headed for better day, day, days
You good to go
All I knew this morning
when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've_seen
since_18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
and your smile
In the back of my mind
making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you
know you know you
'Cause all I know is we said
Hello
And your eyes
look like coming_home
All I know is a simplе name
Everything has_changed
All I know is you hеld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since_yesterday
Is everything has_changed
And all my walls stood tall
painted blue
And I'll take 'em down
take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach
is butterflies
The beautiful kind
making up for lost time
Taking flight
making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you
know you know you
'Cause all I know is we said
Hello
And your eyes
look like coming_home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has_changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since_yesterday
Is everything has_changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you
all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know
that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better
know you better now
I just wanna know you
know you know you
'Cause all I know is we said
Hello
And your eyes
look like coming_home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has_changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since_yesterday
Is everything has_changed
All I know is we said Hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring_rain
And everything has_changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your_face
All I know since_yesterday
Is everything has_changed
You’re less like my lover and more like my therapist
I let all of my problems
Weigh down on your chest
[Pre-Chorus]
You used_to love a good time, up all night, you’d get high
Now all you do is live life with no smile by my side, oh
[Chorus]
So you gotta go
Leave
Don’t_waste your twenties on me
You’re young, free
But I feel you falling asleep
Oh, ten summers ain’t a lot and I’ve already taken three
So go
Leave
Don’t_waste your twenties on me
[Verse_2]
You were so full_of color
I made you a pessimist
I think maybe I’m jеalous of all of your best friends
[Pre-Chorus]
You used_to lovе a
Good time, up all night, you’d get high, oh
Now all you do is
Live life with no smile by my side
[Chorus]
So you gotta go
Leave
Don’t_waste your twenties on me
You’re young, free
But I feel you falling asleep
Ten summers ain’t a lot and I’ve already taken three
So go
Leave
Don’t_waste your twenties on me
Don’t_waste your twenties on me
[Post-Chorus]
Da, da,_da, da, da
Da, da,_da, da, da
Da, da,_da, da, da
Da, da,_da, da, da
[Outro]
Go, leave
Don’t_waste your twenties on me
I still remember the look on your_face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran_off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never_imagined we'd_end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle_of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never_imagined we'd_end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
O-ooh-ooh
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used_to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used_to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun_shines and it's a beautiful_day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never_imagined we'd_end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our_last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our_last
I've_been awake for a while now
you've_got me feelin
like a child now
cause every_time
i see your bubbly face
i get the tinglies
in a silly place
It starts in my toes
and I crinkle my nose
where ever it goes i always know
that you make me smile
please stay for a while now
just take your time
where ever you go
The rain is fallin
on my window_pane
but we are hidin in a safer place
under the covers
stayin dry and warm
you give me feelins that i adore
It starts in my toes
makes me crinkle my nose
where ever it goes
i always know
that you make me smile
please stay for a while now
just take your time
where ever you go
What am i gonna say
when you make me feel this way
I just mmmmmmmmmmm
It starts in my toes
makes me crinkle my nose
where ever it goes
i always know
that you make me smile
please stay for a while now
just take your time
where ever you go
I’ve_been asleep for a while now
You tucked me in just
like a child now
Cause every_time you hold me
in your arms
Im comfortable
enough to feel your warmth
It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feelin shows
Cause you make me smile
Baby just take your time
Holdin me tight
Where ever where ever
where ever you go
Where ever where ever
where ever you go
i always know
'Cause you make me smile
even just for a while
Now go stand in the corner
and think_about what you did
Ha
The story starts when it was
hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him
right there where I wanted him
She came along got him along
and let's hear the applause
She took him_faster than
you can say_sabotage
I never saw it coming
nor did I suspected it
I underestimated
just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain
was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just
who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's_an actress
She's better known for the
things that she_does
On the mattress
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing I do
better_than revenge
She lives her life like it's a
party and she's on the list
She_looks at me like
I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present
frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho
Cause I like to rhyme her
name with things
but
Sophistication isn't
what you wear
or who you know
Or pushing people down to
get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that
in prep school
So it's up to me
But no_amount of vintage dresses
gives you dignity
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's_an actress
She's better known for the things
that she_does
On the mattress
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing I do
better_than revenge Ha ha
I'm just another thing for you
to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to
roll your eyes at honey
You might have him
but I always get the last word
She's not a saint and
she's not what you think
She's_an actress
She's better known for the things
that she_does
On the mattress
Soon_she's gonna find
Stealing_other people's_toys
on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There_is nothing
I do better_than revenge
And do you still
feel like you know
what you're_doing
Cause I don't think you do Oh
Do you still feel like
you know what you're_doing
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how_much
better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you're so_much better
She took him_faster than
you can say_sabotage
You're singing in the shower
like there's_no one_else around
Sliding down the hallway
dancing around the house
One glass of champagne and girl
you're painting up the town
That's when I love you more
When you're late
for your friends party
'cause you can't find
a thing to wear
You start cussing at humidity
and fussing with your hair
You give up and
throw a T-Shirt on like
you don't even care
That's when I love you more
With every minute
every up and down again
As_long as you're in it girl
my world keeps_getting better
I swear I can't fall harder
oh but I said that before
And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that I love you more
When you can't see the sun
cause it raining in your eyes
There's clouds around your halo
and your wings won't let you fly
When the whole
world gets too heavy
Well baby that's
when I'm gonna love you more
Yeah love you more
With every minute
every up and down again
As_long as you're in it girl
my world keeps_getting better
I swear I can't fall harder
oh but I said that before
And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that
I love you more yeah
Love you more oh
No it ain't a competition
and I ain't keeping score
I love you more
I love you more
Maybe I can't see the future
one_thing I know for sure
I'm gonna love you more
gonna love you more
With every minute
every up and down again
As_long as you're in it girl
my world keeps_getting better
I swear I can't fall harder
oh but I said that before
And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that I love you more
I love you more I love you more
Baby just like that I love you more
It_doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
It's bigger_than the rest
of us he'll promise you that
I'm glad I'm glad
He's picking up the drinks
and then he's knocking
them back
I've never seen someone
who wears a sad little
mask like that
like that
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his_hand
Is_busy today
with someone_else's plans
He_chooses life and then
she_chooses a man
It_doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
In any case I look_at him
my life ain't half as bad
as bad
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his_hand
Is_busy today
with someone_else's plans
He_chooses life
and then she_chooses a man
He's picking it up
but she don't give a damn
Hold me
it's a crisis
that we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting
an American war
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away
Hold me
it's a crisis that we're
pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting
an American war
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his_hand
Is_busy today
with someone_else's plans
He_chooses life and then
she_chooses a man
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away
There you are
Like the man of my dreams
There you go
Saying all of the right things
I'm just a girl
At_least that's what you think
If love's a crime
I'll rob you blind
You hunt your prey
like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you
wanting_more
But baby I got you beat
got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait
but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking_thief
A heartbreaking_thief
Try and go
If you think you can escape
But my claws
Are in too deep for you
to get away
You're in control
At_least that's what you'll say
Cause we_both tell
the story different
You were mine from the beginning
You hunt your prey
like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you
wanting_more
But baby I got you beat
got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait
but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking_thief
A heartbreaking_thief
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn scorn
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn scorn
You had it coming
Deserve to be punished
Don't mess with a woman
Scorn scorn
You hunt your prey
like a carnivore
Thought that you'd be gettin' me
Cause just one taste leaves you
wanting_more
But baby I got you beat
got you beat
Honey you didn't see
What's hidden up my sleeve
Took the bait
but I'll took everything
Because I'm a heartbreaking_thief
A heartbreaking_thief
A heartbreaking_thief
If I had to break it down
I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Movin' the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away
[Chorus]
And your office job and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed
For all these_years
[Verse_2]
I thought I was a genius, but now I'm twenty-two
And it's startin' to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away
[Chorus]
With my fist full_of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds like favorite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away
[Verse_3]
I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully fallin' apart for the Princess of Norway
[Chorus]
But you, with your tall slashes, your infinite t-shirts
I should've_known when your favorite record was the same as my father's
You'd take me down
[Verse 4]
I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words, and halfway to space
But there, by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan
[Chorus]
You found me clean as a pine
The man with the axe and the look in his eyes
We've been through so_many hard times
I'm writin' a love song for you, baby
I'm pretty sure
we almost broke up last_night
I threw my phone
across the room at you
I was expecting
some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning
I said we should talk_about it
'Cause I read you should
never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came
in wearing a football helmet
And said Okay let's talk
And I said
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you
for quite_some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay
Before you I'd only dated
self-indulgent takers
Who took all
of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries
and now I'm always laughing
And I love you
because you have given me
No choice but to
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you for quite
some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay_stay stay_stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out
with you all the time
All those_times
that you didn't leave
it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
for my whole_life
Stay and I'll be loving you
for quite_some time
No one_else is gonna love me
when I get mad_mad mad
So I think that it's best
if we_both stay_stay
Stay_stay stay_stay
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you for quite
some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay_stay
Stay_stay stay_stay
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you for quite
some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay
Ha-ha-ha it's so fun
But if someone_comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
Everything fades
Everything dies
Put me in a vase, but you can't
You can't stop time
It's not 1999
But this face is still mine
The way you look_at me
I swear my heart hits rewind
But if someone_comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone_comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let_'em change your mind
Wonder why you took a risk
On a broken_heart you cannot fix
No, I never knew a love like this
Now we're picking purple irises
I got you
And you got me
And do you still think I'm pretty?
And are you happy?
It's not 2014
But you still look good in those jeans
Lookin' in the mirror
Do you see what I see?
But if someone_comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone_comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let_'em change your mind
Wonder why you took a risk
On a broken_heart you cannot fix
No, I never knew a love like this
Now we're picking purple irises
And we're blooming into the change
I'm overthinking it
Picking purple irises
And leaving love stains
I got violet memories
I'm overthinking it
Oh, and leaving love stains
Love stains
But if someone_comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone_comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let_'em change your mind
Oh, if someone_comes along and tries to love you like I love you
Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you
If someone_comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you
Don't let_'em change your mind
Wonder why you took a risk
On a broken_heart you cannot fix
No, I never knew a love like this
Now we're picking purple irises
Her day starts with a coffee
and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready
so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that come
get me look in her eyes
Well it kinda scares me
the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild
Beautiful crazy
she can't_help but amaze me
The way that she_dances
ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy
but her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend
can't_wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says 'let's stay on the couch
and watch TV'
And she falls asleep
Beautiful crazy
she can't_help but amaze me
The way that she_dances
ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy
but her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable unforgettable
It's unusual unbelievable
How I'm such a fool
yeah I'm such a fool for her
Beautiful crazy
she can't_help but amaze me
The way that she_dances
ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy she's crazy
she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me
Now that it’s just me and you
Can we talk for a few
I’ve got something to get off my chest
You probably already_know
Been in my boots before
My heart’s racing like hell but I guess
I’m just gonna say it out_loud
I’m in love with your daughter
And I’ve_been since the first_time I saw her I’ll ask her the question
If you give your blessing
When she takes my hand you can trust I’ll love her enough for the both of us
I know that you loved her first
But for better or worse
I’ll treat her like you prayed that I would
When she’s all dressed in white
And you’re giving her away
For the rest_of my life
You can trust when I say
She’ll always be your baby girl
And I’m gonna give her the world
If you wanna hang out you've_got to take her out; cocaine.
If you wanna get down, down on the ground; cocaine.
She don't_lie, she don't_lie, she don't lie; cocaine.
If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues; cocaine.
When your day is done and you wanna run; cocaine.
She don't_lie, she don't_lie, she don't lie; cocaine.
If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on; cocaine.
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back; cocaine.
She don't_lie, she don't_lie, she don't lie; cocaine.
She don't_lie, she don't_lie, she don't lie; cocaine.
We were both_young
when I first_saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing_there
On a balcony of summer air
See the lights
See the party
the ball gowns
I see you make your way
through the crowd
You say_hello
Little did I know
That you were_Romeo you
were throwing_pebbles
And my daddy_said
stay away_from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go
and I said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting all
there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
So I sneak out
to the garden to see you
We keep quiet
cause we're dead if they know
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were
Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy_said
stay away_from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go
and I said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting all
there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and
I'll be the princess
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
Romeo_save me
they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
but it's real
Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
I got tired_of waiting
Wondering if
you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the
outskirts of town
I said
Romeo_save me
I've_been feeling so alone
I keep waiting
for you but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knealt to the ground
and pulled out a ring
And said
Marry me
Juliet you'll_never have to be alone
I love you and
that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go
pick out a white_dress
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
Cause we were both_young
when I first_saw you
When I see you I see me
Caged heart
Passion up your sleeve
A music cocoon surrounding me
I know you know it but
How do we show it
There's too_much to lose
But tonight we choose
So we dance alone in the moonlight
Just you & I
And the stars and I'm falling
through the sky
To find it ah_ah
And there's magic in the air
A lonest flower floating
out of despair
And my winter sun
You are my broken one
Craze of sand her heart to grasp
As the future slips on past
All we've got is this_moment
And I say we own it
So we dance alone in the moonlight
Just you & I
And the stars and I'm falling
through the sky
To find it ah_ah ah
Oooh oh
So we dance alone in the moonlight
Just you & I
And the stars and I'm falling
through the sky
To find it ah_ah ah
And I know it can't be sure
But I have to follow more
I'm waiting_for a cure
ah_ah ah
We once had a time
Meet me at the Castro tonight
I held a rose
You held who knows
But that's fine
We fell in love
We fell in love
At the John Reed Choir
And right there and then
I swore to no end
Swore to never let you go
But love's got a way of fading away
Oh I never saw you again
I never saw you again
Waiting in line
To see Suede play and
We had a time
I wished we could stay in
Waiting in line
To see Suede play
Oh how I love
how the sun lays upon us
Staining the inches of skin
Oh says the clouds
as they whisper above us
Oh what a life it's been
And all of the lies we've lied
And all of the time
that's timed our_lives
How do we know
what's wrong or right this time
When all of the trees
falling down to the ground and
Fall to your knees
like a child that is crawling
All the while
we never stop to smile
Oh how she loves how
the spring comes to greet her
With lands overflowing
with green
All of the drops pulling down
'till they meet us
Latching themselves onto me
We may_not have
missed this time
But then when they all run dry
And that beautiful light
that lights our eyes is gone
What have we done
When all of the trees
falling down to the ground and
Fall to your knees
like a child that is crawling
All the while we never
stop to stare
Do we even care
When all of the tears
from her eyes have collected
Form in the skies
and leave us unprotected
I can't fathom
why we say goodnight
When we mean to say_goodbye
Waiter send this to the table
the party of one
The only other lonely soul
in this place
And so you're finishing up
your coffee
But then where you're gonna run
Where'd you get
that look on your_face
You should always
let the sun go down on your anger
Let it burn you to sleep
Bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep
I loved you the first_time I saw you
And you know I love you still
But I am tired
And I am_yours
Don't even think_about your freedom
Or taking that flight
Or going back upon your
promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your
I statements and
your weaponized words
Are paper tigers now
Oh your constant overthinking
and your secretive drinking
Are making you
more and more alone
And girl you can slam
the door behind you
It ain't ever gonna close
Because when you're home
you're already home
I am tired
I am tired
I loved you the first_time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first_time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore
I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
And I'm coming_home
'Cause I am_yours I am_yours
I am_yours I am_yours I am_yours
I am_yours I am_yours I am_yours
I am_yours I am_yours
Mr. Perfect face
Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye
and told me you
would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've_been waitin'
for you all my life
Mr. Every_single day until the end
I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know
Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone
I fall_apart
It takes_everything in me
just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see
that you're okay
Hello_Mr. Perfectly_fine
How's your heart after
breaking mine
Mr._Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Hello_Mr. Casually_cruel
Mr._Everything revolves around you
I've_been Miss_Misery
since your goodbye
And you're Mr._Perfectly fine
Mr. Never told me why
Mr. Never had to see me cry
Mr. Insincere apology
so he doesn't look
like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even
heard my name
Well I thought you might be
different than the rest
I guess you're all the same
'Cause I hear he's got his arm
'round a brand-new girl
I've_been pickin' up my heart
he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past
what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see
that it never fazed you
Hello_Mr. Perfectly_fine
How's your heart after
breakin' mine
Mr._Always at the right
place at the right time baby
Hello_Mr. Casually_cruel
Mr._Everything revolves
around you
I've_been Miss_Misery
since your goodbye
And you're Mr._Perfectly fine
So dignified in your
well-pressed suit
So strategized all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room
Oh he's so smug Mr._Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss
Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then you'll be Mr. Too late
Goodbye Mr._Perfectly fine
How's your heart after
breakin' mine
Mr._Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Goodbye Mr._Casually cruel
Mr._Everything revolves around you
I've_been Miss_Misery
for the last time
And you're Mr._Perfectly fine
You're perfectly fine
Mr. Look me in the eye
and told me you would
never go away
You said you'd never go away
[Intro]
Hey, this is Dad. Just, uh, calling to say hi.
Just wondering what you’re up to.
Um, give me a call back when you get a chance, ‘kay?
Bye.
[Verse_1]
I can’t sleep again
I’ve_been having nightmares about you, Dad
I was hurt, you turned away
Said, “Don’t make a scene, or Mama will get mad”
[Pre-Chorus]
When I need you, you’re just halfway there
So I had to learn to hold back the tears
[Chorus]
I’ve_been feeling lonely
I wish I could talk to you
But you never listen
The way that I need you to
And I miss you, but I’ll let you go
So I’ll just be lonely without you
[Verse_2]
I was seventeen
She yelled at me everyday
You heard every_word
And then you looked away
[Pre-Chorus]
I grew_up way too fast
To make up for the love I never had
[Chorus]
I’ve_been feeling lonely
I wish I could talk to you
But you never listen
The way that I need you to
And I miss you, but I’ll let you go
So I’ll just be lonely without you
[Post-Chorus]
And I miss you, but I’ll let you go
So I’ll just be lonely without you
[Outro]
Yeah, I’ve_been feeling…
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping_through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping_through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping_through my fingers all the time
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had_planned for us to go?
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know
Slipping_through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping_through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping_through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping_through my fingers
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I don't come here much but she loves this place
And I've gotta find her
I don't smoke but she_does when drinks
So I've got a lighter
I like whiskey, she likes tequila
So I take one of both
Just in case she walks in, I'll be good to go
She only_dances to cowboy_songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Don't wanna leave 'til it's closing
So I've got a twenty on the jukebox
to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where
I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only_dances to cowboy_songs
She only_dances to cowboy_songs
(she only_dances to cowboy songs)
Yeah, she makes love like an ember in the rain
Just something about her
One night with her'd make anyone think
They can't live_without her
If she rolls through, Three Chords and the Truth
Might get me half a chance
That steel guitar'll steal her heart if anything can
'Cause she only_dances to cowboy_songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Don't wanna leave 'til it's closing
So I've got a twenty on the jukebox
to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where
I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only_dances to cowboy_songs
She only_dances to cowboy_songs
I'll be wasting quarters, waiting_for her
Just in case she shows
And I'll be back tomorrow if she don't
She only_dances to cowboy_songs
Loves to get lost in a moment
She comes alive when the neon's on
Know she's leaving with me
when it's closing
So I've got a twenty on the jukebox
to keep it playing
Anything that sounds like Waylon
And right here's where
I'll be staying all night long
'Cause she only_dances to cowboy_songs
She only_dances to cowboy_songs
I don't come here much
but she loves this place
And I've gotta find her
Yesterday i got lost
in the circus
feeling like such a mess
And now I'm down
I'm just hanging on the corner
I can't_help but reminisce
Cuz when you're gone
all the colours fade
When you're gone
no new years day parade
You're gone
colours seem to fade
Your mama called she said
thah you're downstairs crying
Feeling like such a mess
Ya i hear ya
in the back ground balling
What happened
to your sweet summer time dress
I know we all
we all got our faults
We get locked in our vaults
and we stay
When you're gone
all the colurs fade
When you're gone
no new years day parade
You're gone
colours seem to fade
colours seem to fade
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreamin'
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh,_darlin', don't you ever_grow up
Don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh,_darlin', don't you ever_grow up
Don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no_one break your heart
And no_one will desert you
Just try to never grow_up
Never grow_up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
At fourteen, there's just so_much you can't do
And you can't_wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older too
And don't lose the way that you dance
Around in your PJs getting ready for school
Oh,_darlin', don't you ever_grow up
Don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh,_darlin', don't you ever_grow up
Don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even_though you want to
Just try to never grow_up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite_songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so_much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish_I'd never_grown up
I wish I'd never_grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow_up
Wish_I'd never_grown up
Could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow_up
Wish_I'd never_grown up
It could still be simple
Oh,_darlin', don't you ever_grow up
Don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh,_darlin', don't you ever_grow up
Don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no_one break your heart
And even_though you want to
Please try to never grow_up
Oh, oh
Don't you ever_grow up
Oh (never grow up)
Just never grow_up
Ma take this badge off of me
I can't use it any more
It's getting dark too dark to see
Feel like I'm knockin'
on_heaven's door
Knock_knock

knockin'_on heavens_door
scratching at the surface now
I'm trying hard to work it out
So much has gone misunderstood
This mystery only leads to doubt
And I didn't understand
When you reached out to
take my hand
And if you have something to say
You'd better say it now
Cause this is what you've
waited for
Your chance to even up the score
And as these shadows
fall on me now
I will somehow
Cause I'm picking up a
message Lord
And I'm closer than
I've ever been before
So if you have something to say
Say it to me now
Say it to me now
Following Genie from a bottle
Together searching for the
castle of Oz
Riding the dream of
adventures crossing the rainbow
Magical power of mistery
the power a veiled witch was
longing for
Let them free this
speel bound people lock
little girl
Why don't you make your
dreams come ture
When you were younger
and you thought all things
were possible
of course I was naive Now I'm old
Why do you feel that way
whenever you feel make a
wish for your dreams come_true
Please make my dreams come ture
Yes way to go
Raise your hands up Peter
Pan and Wendy
once you cannot fly up high
Only full_of happy memories
in our heart
Oh ideal taste of enjoyment
Imagine fairy's
world up in the sky
once we open up the gate
We'll make it happen and
achieve everything
we've_been dreaming of
Where the woods are veiled
in the darkness
And where an island's
breathing with magic
Let's have a dream of a
fantastic future for us
Have you ever heard of the
story about
the black hearted
prince and the
wicked Cinderella
No I haven't It is a story
I can't even imagine or believe
Why can't you believe
it could be ture
Just maybe it is
story of you and I
Throw everything you
dont't want to know
high up in the ocean sky
Only full_of happy memories
in our heart
Oh ideal taste of enjoyment
Imagine fairy's world up
in the sky
once we open up the gate
We'll make it happen and
achieve everything
we've_been dreaming of
Throw everything you dont't
want to know
high up in the ocean sky
Only full_of happy memories
in our heart
Oh ideal taste of enjoyment
Imagine fairy's world up
in the sky
once we open up the gate
We'll make it happen and
achieve everything
that we've_been dreaming of
It's in your heart
Love changes everything
I see my life in daydreams
Little scenes of you and me
And there you are singing to me
Soft little melodies
On your ukulele
Swinging in the summer breeze
I could think_about it
A_thousand more times
I could think_about you love
The rest_of my life
Uh_ooh I could
Uh_ooh I could
And I know love has
treated you coldly before
Left you lonely
Oh but not anymore
I was made to love you strongly
Time doesn't exist
Melts away in a mist
With the touch of your_lips
Oh_oh
I could think_about it
A_thousand more times
I could think_about you love
The rest_of my life
Uh_ooh I could
Uh_ooh I could
And I know love has
treated you coldly before
Left you lonely
Oh but not anymore
I was made to love you strongly
I could think_about it
A_thousand more times
I could think_about you love
The rest_of my life
Uh_ooh I could
Uh_ooh I could
And I know love has
treated you coldly before
Left you lonely
Oh but not anymore
I was made to love you strongly
They won't know who we are
So we_both can pretend
It's written on the mountains
A line that never ends
As the devil spoke
we spilled out on the floor
And the pieces broke
and the people wanted more
And the rugged wheel
is turning another round
Dorian carry on
Will you come along to the end
Will you ever let us carry on
Swaying like the children
Singled out for praise
The inside out on the open
With the straightest face
As the sad-eyed woman spoke
we missed our chance
The final dying joke caught
in our hands
And the rugged wheel is turning
another round
Dorian carry on
Will you come along to the end
Will you ever let us carry on
Dorian carry on
Will you come along to the end
Will you ever let us carry on
Dorian will you follow us down
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
Baby I know that
you've_been wondering
Mmm so here goes nothing
In_case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this
life without you
Even_though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart
a long long time ago
In_case you didn't know
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking
One of the things
that I've_been feeling
Mmm it's time you hear em
In_case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this
life without you
Even_though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart
a long long time ago
In_case you didn't know
You've_got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything
In_case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this
life without you
Even_though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart
a long long time ago
Yeah you had my heart
a long long time ago
In_case you didn't know
In_case you didn't know
Where does she go
my love with you
The words that she wrote
my love they're new
So while your head is in the sky
And your heart is floating high
She'll paint it blue
What does she give my love
that I don't give
The taste remains on my lips
those_times we kissed
So while your head
is floating high
And your heart is in the sky
It's you I'll miss
So while your head is in the sky
And your heart is floating high
It's you I'll miss
I went with you up to
The place you grew_up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long_enough to
Walden it with you
Any longer it would have got old
Singing Ace of Spades
when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed
LA's all right
Sleeping in my bed again
And getting in my head
And then walk around
the reservoir
You you must have
been looking_for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
One of your eyes is
always half shut
Something happened
when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels_like I did
How Soon Is Now
in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it
because your dad
Lived in a campground
in the back of a van
You said that song will creep
you out until you're dead
And you must have
been looking_for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
I want to live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody_else
makes the bed
We'll watch TV
while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind
since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems
I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot gun
Speeding 'cause fuck the cops
And you you must have
been looking_for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
I buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking
back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wall
I was a lonesome cowboy
Lonesome as I could be
You came along changed my life
And fixed what was broken in me
I was a lonesome cowboy
I didn't have a friend
Now I got friends
comin' out of my ears
I'll never be lonesome again
You can't be happy
when you're all by yourself
Go on tell me I'm wrong
You're wrong
When someone takes you
down from the shelf
And plays with you some
it's wonderful
Wonderful
I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore
I just found out what love is about
I've never felt this way before
I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore
You were just a friend
of a friend of a friend at a party
Only knew your name
'cause you wrote it in Sharpie
On your cup gettin'
drunk on Bacardi
At somebody's brother's apartment
Only noticed we were
on the same couch 'cause
You sang the wrong words way
too loud to
My favorite_song
so I called you out
Who would have known
it would start with
Three drinks at 2_AM
One Hey nice to meet you
sayin'
What you got goin' on later
How were you ever a stranger
Three words we said too fast
You were just someone
one month back
Now lovin' you's second nature
How wеre you ever a strangеr
How'd I ever look_at you
and not see it
You'd be the one
that I'd trust with my secrets
If you had told me that
that weekend
I wouldn't even believe it
Three drinks at 2_AM
One Hey nice to meet you
sayin'
What you got goin' on later
How were you ever a stranger
Three words we said too fast
You were just someone
one month back
Now lovin' you's second nature
How were you ever
how were you ever a stranger
Oh (A stranger)
I never saw us gettin' this close
Honestly I'm not mad at it though
Emotions all under the microscope
There_ain't a part_of me
you don't know
You were just a friend
of a friend of a friend at a
party (Oh)
Three drinks at 2_AM
One Hey nice to meet you
sayin'
What you got goin' on later
How were you ever a stranger
Three words we said too fast
You were just someone
one month back
Now lovin' you's second nature
How were you ever how were you
ever a stranger
Oh (A stranger a stranger)
A stranger (How were you ever
how were you ever)
How were you ever
how were you ever (A stranger)
Oh (A stranger)
Wake_up my love
beneath the midday sun
Alone once more alone
This travelin boy
was only passing_through
But he will always think of you
One night of love
beside a strange young smile
As warm as I have known
A travelin boy
and only passing_through
But one who will always
think of you
Take my place out on the road again
I must do what I must do
Yes I know we were lovers
but a drifter discovers
A travelin boy
and only passing_through
But one who will always
think of you
Take my place out on the road again
I must do what I must do
Yes I know we were lovers
but a drifter discovers
That a perfect love won't
always last forever
I won't say that I'll be back again
Cause time alone will tell
So no goodbyes
for one just passing_through
But one who will always
think of you
No goodbyes
I tried to repress it
Then I carried its crown
I reached out to undress it
And love let me down
Love let me down
So I tried to erase it
But the ink bled right through
Almost drove myself crazy
When these_words led to you
And all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then colour me in
Well I tried to control it
And cover it up
I reached out to console it
It_was never enough
Never enough
So I tried to forget it
That was all part_of the show
Told myself I'd regret it
But what do I know
About all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then colour me in
Come let me love you
Come let me take this through the end
Of all these useless dreams of living
In all these useless dreams
All these useless dreams of living
In all these old noes
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me
I can't_wait to show you
where I grew_up
Walk you 'round the foothills
of my town
Probably feel like
you've_been there before
After hearing all the stories
I've_been telling you
For six months now
We'll probably have to sleep
in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church
because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before
we hit the road
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little
faster_than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin' but pretend
that he don't like you
Oh if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more
hearts than mine
My sister's gonna
ask a million questions
Say anything she can
to turn you red
And when you meet
my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights
I can't outlive
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little
faster_than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner but pretend
that he don't like you
Oh if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking
more hearts than mine
Oh
Mmh
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache
I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey
over ice and
Tell a lie and say he
never really liked you
Oh if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more
hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more
hearts than mine
How do I get through
the night without you
If I had to live_without you
What kinda life
would that be
Oh I need you in my arms
need you to hold
You're my world
my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything good in my life
Without you
There would be no sun
in my sky
There would be no love
in my life
There would be no world
left for me
And I baby
I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live_without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live
If you ever leave
Baby you would
take away everything
Need you with me
Baby don't you know
that you are
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live_without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live
How do I live_without you
Lying in my bed I hear
the clock tick and think of you
Turning in circles confusion
is nothing new
Flashback - warm nights - almost
left behind
Suitcases of memories time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too_far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you said
Then you say go slow -
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me
Time_after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I'll be waiting
Time_after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I will be waiting
Time_after time
Time_after time
After your picture fades
and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
I'm wondering if you're OK
You said go slow - I fall behind
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me
Time_after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I'll be waiting
Time_after time
If you fall I will catch you -
I will be waiting
Time_after time
Time_after time
Time_after time
Time_after time
Time_after time
You're all alone at a party
you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight
and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags
It could be rainin'
on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed
about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me
but all I'm sayin'
Ain't_nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't_no pain it can't wash_away
From the moment
that it hits your_lips
Makes those clouds
look a little_less gray
Oh you could be lonely
or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown
into a smile real quick
There_ain't nothing
that a beer can't fix
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin'
is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin'
watchin' your team losin'
that championship ring
And you're feelin
like life ain't_fair
It could be rainin'
on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed
about your work situation
Ain't_nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't_no pain
it can't wash_away
From the moment
that it hits your_lips
Makes those clouds
look a little_less gray
Oh you could be lonely
heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown
into a smile real quick
Ain't_nothing that a beer can't fix
Yeehaw
It could be rainin'
on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed
about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it
for no special occasion
Ain't_nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't_no pain
it can't wash_away no
From the moment
that it hits your_lips
Makes those clouds
look a little_less gray
Oh you could be lonely
Lonely
Heartbroken
Heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown
into a smile real quick
So quick
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down
it will do the trick
Ain't_nothing that a beer can't fix
Maybe we'll sleep here
Covered in star shine
Out on the ocean
Wrapped up in night-time song
Hear the tide rise and fall
Well sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all
Perhaps we'll wake here
Soaking in sunshine
Dancing on the ocean
Drinking the morning down
Hear the birds cry and call
Well sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all
Oh sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all
Yeah sometimes it's something
Sometimes it's nothing at all
Fly to your open skies
Alive with fire
So burning bright
See the world
See the world
Fly on your wings up high
Shine that light
Oh with all your might
See the world
See the world
Wild whirl
A wild whirl
A child's world awaits
A while more
Soon you'll_find the magic
You were meant to see
Were meant to be
Fly take your leave ignite
Free those wings
Oh butterfly
See the world
See the world
Fly go on dare defy
Trembling tide
in the dark of night
See the world
See the world
Wild whirl
A wild whirl
A child's world awaits
A while more
Soon you'll_find the magic
You were meant to see
Were meant to be
Fly don't you cry
Look up high
Your skies are alive
Try you'll be fine
Years gone by
Are coming back to you
Before your very eyes
Fly take your leave ignite
Free those wings
Oh butterfly
See the world
See the world
See the world
See the world
See the world
See the world
Where the north_wind meets the sea
There's a river full_of memory
Sleep my darling safe and sound
For in this river all is found
In her waters deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too_far
or you'll be drowned
Yes she will sing
to those who'll hear
And in her song all magic flows
But can you brave
what you most fear
Can you face what the river knows
Where the north_wind meets the sea
There's a mother full_of memory
Come my darling homeward bound
When all is lost
then all is found
I'm an alternate universe in Target lingerie
You're a country_song in three-four time
I can see through time in on a clear day
Tastes like black grape and chlorine
And something else that I can't name
Maybe I could describe it
Unless you make me, I won't say
Say, say
[Chorus]
If we peel apart
Will we be stronger than we were before
We had formed ourselves together
In a temporary whole?
And if wе reunite, will we still know
Thе things that we had learned before?
We're not boxes, doors, or borders
We were portals
[Verse_2]
Our arms form a circle
And sometimes when they take that shape
Suddenly I'm in a tunnel
Headed to another state
You're a hand punched through a pane of glass
To get the handle on the other_side
Yeah, we're cut on the knuckles
But at_least we're open wide
Wide, wide
[Chorus]
If we peel apart
Will we be stronger than we were before
We had formed ourselves together
In a temporary whole?
And if we reunite, will we still know
The things that we had learned before?
We're not boxes, doors, or borders
We were portals
If you want someone
to enter in your life
Show a part_of your world
they can dream about
It will seem a fair idea
If you make it their idea
Go back to your corner
Let them come to you
Patience is the hardest thing
to have to learn
Hours seem like oceans
when desire burns
Rushing in will ruin all
you must bide your time
Sow a seed in water
wait for love to grow
Love to you is given
love is gifted you
No love can be taken
that love is not true
Love is pain and suffering
love can bе a lonely thing
Once you've known that magic
who can livе without it
Put your_lips close to mine
As_long as they don't touch
Out of focus eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too_much
And I'll do_anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk_away
But you're quicksand
This_slope is_treacherous
This path is reckless
This_slope is_treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
This_slope is_treacherous
This path is reckless
This_slope is_treacherous
I I I like it
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless_night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I would follow you
follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
This hope is_treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is_treacherous
I-I-I I-I-I I-I-I
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless_night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I would follow you
follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
This_slope is_treacherous
I-I-I like it
Chase away my heart and heartache
Run me over, throw me over, cast me out
Find a river running to the west wind
Just above the shoreline
You will see a cloud
Tie me to a tiny wooden raft
Burn my body, point me to the undertow
Push me off into the void at last
Watch me drift and watch me struggle
let me go... ’cause I really wanna know:
Will anybody ever love me?
For good reasons
Without grievance, not for sport
Will anybody ever love me?
In every season
Pledge allegiance to my heart
Pledge allegiance to my burning heart
Hello wildness please forgive me now
For the heartache and the misery I create
Take my suffering as I take my vow
Wash me now, anoint me
With that golden blade
Tie me to the final wooden stake
Burn my body, celebrate the afterglow
Wash away the summer sins I made
Watch me drift and
Watch me struggle, let me go
’cause I really wanna know:
Will anybody ever love me?
For good reasons
Without grievance, not for sport
Will anybody ever love me?
In every season
Pledge allegiance to my heart
Pledge allegiance to my burning heart
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue_sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
I should've_known
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or_maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as_fast as you can"
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too_young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've_known
You are an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've_known
You should've_known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've_known
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday,_I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday,_I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out, 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right_now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
Someday,_I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday,_I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same_old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday,_I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday,_I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday,_I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought_I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
Come_on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Something's_gone terribly_wrong
You're all I wanted
Come_on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Can't_breathe whenever_you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
Stood there and watched you walk_away
From everything we had
But I still mean every_word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing
Come_on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Something's_gone terribly_wrong
You're all I wanted
Come_on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Can't_breathe whenever_you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no
Come_on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Something's_gone terribly_wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come_on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Can't_breathe whenever_you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought_I'd see it break
Never_thought I'd see it
I never dare
to reach for the moon
I never thought
I'd know heaven so soon
I couldn't hope to say
how I feel
The joy in my heart
no words can reveal
Over and over
I whisper your name
Over and over
I kiss you again
I see the light of
love in your eyes
Love is forever
no more goodbyes
Now just a memory
the tears that I cried
Now just a memory
the sighs that I sighed
Dreams that I cherished
all have come_true
All my tomorrows
I give to you
Over and over
I whisper your name
Over and over
I kiss you again
I see the light of
love in your eyes
Love is forever
no more goodbyes
Life's summer leaves may
turn into gold
The love that we
share will never grow old
Here in your arms
no words far_away
Here in your arms
forever I'll stay
Over and over
I whisper your name
Over and over
I kiss you again
I see the light of
love in your eyes
Love is forever
no more goodbyes
Over and over
I whisper your name
Over and over
I kiss you again
I see the light of
love in your eyes
Love is forever
no more goodbyes

On a warm summer's eve
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us,
he began to speak
He_said, Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind me sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice
So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his faced lost all expression
He_said, If you're gonna
play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
Know_when to fold_'em
Know_when to walk_away
Know_when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
And in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
Know_when to fold_'em
Know_when to walk_away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
When to hold_'em
Know_when to fold_'em
When to fold_'em
Know_when to walk_away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
Know_when to fold_'em
Know_when to walk_away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
It's that time again
where we all get
to be together again
The snow is falling
in this frightful weather
And I can't_wait to see
all the lights
on the tree and
Baby It's Christmas say yeah
Baby It's Christmas say yeah
It's pumpkin pie
it's glistening outside
Family and cheers
so happy you're here
'Cause it's Christmas say yeah
Baby it's Christmas
yeah_yeah yeah
In a cozy sweater
singing songs by the fire
Hear the sleigh bells ringing
and sipping on apple cider
Presents under the tree
stealing kisses from me
'Cause it's Christmas say yeah
Baby it's Christmas say yeah
It's pumpkin pie
it's glistening outside
Family and cheers
so happy you're here
'Cause it's Christmas say yeah
Kiss me under the mistletoe
I'll be your angel laying
in the snow
Kiss me under the mistletoe
I'll be your angel laying
in the snow
Oh yeah
Baby it's Christmas say yeah
It's pumpkin pie
it's glistening outside
Family and cheers
so happy you're here
'Cause it's Christmas say yeah
Baby it's Christmas say yeah
Baby it's Christmas oh yeah
Baby baby it's Christmas
say yeah
Oh, thinkin' about
all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young
and wild and free
Now nothin' can take
you away_from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin'
back for more
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin'
here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there
in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
Oh, once in your life
you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up
when you're feelin' down
Yeah, nothin' could change
what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
I've_been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along
Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good
times and the bad
Yeah, I'll be standin'_there by you
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin'
here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
When we wake
Hear the birds and see the sun
Side by side our fears are done
Oh the the good_times just begun
Oh, we know what we have
Let's hold on tight
Found what we're looking_for in life
Call us crazy but things are finally right
With you and I the future is bright
Oh, you and I we got it
Oh, we don't need no more
Oh, even in the hard times
You and I can weather any_storm
Before sleep
Hear the crickets, see the moon
Side by side and through and through
No limit to what we can do
Oh, we know what we have
Let's hold on tight
Found what we're looking_for in life
Call us crazy but things are finally right
With you and I the future is bright
Oh, you and I we got it
Oh, we don't need no more
Oh, even in the hard times
You and I can weather any_storm
Oh, you and I we got it
Oh, we don't need no more
Oh, even in the hard times
You and I can weather any_storm
All I do is sleep all day,
and think of you.
A memory of the cushion life
I'm clinging to.
The image of a mutual one, our haven.
The sombre chords of our song,
the fading.
Love is no big truth,
driven by our genes,
we are simple selfish beings.
A symphony that's you,
joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping.
Passion and its brother hate,
they come and go.
Could easily be made
to stay for longer though.
Many people play this game
so willingly,
do I have to be like them,
or be lonely?
Love is no big truth,
driven by our genes,
we are simple selfish beings.
A symphony that's you,
joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping.
another view of what there is to it,
getting me through it
I'll never need it again. not again, not again...
Your little hands wrapped
around my finger And it's
so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter
cause you're dreaming So I
tuck you in and turn on
your favorite night light
To you everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Wont let no_one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow_up
Never grow_up
You're in the car
on the way to the movies And you're
mortified your mama's
dropping you off
At 14 there's just so_much
you can't do
And you can't_wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don't make
her drop you off around the block
Remember she's getting older too
And don't
lose the way that you dance
around in your PJs
getting ready for school
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
No_one's ever burned
Nothing's ever left you scarred
Even_though you want to
just try to never grow_up
Take pictures in your mind of
your childhood room
Memorize what is sounded like
what your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps
remember the words said
And all your little brother's
favorite_songs
I just realized everything
I had is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big_city
they just dropped me off
It's so_much colder than I
thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and
turn my nightlight on
Wish_I'd never_grown up
I wish I'd never_grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow_up
Wish_I'd never_grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow_up
Wish_I'd never_grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever_grow up
don't you ever_grow up
It could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no_one break your heat
And even throuhg toyu want to
please try to never grow_up
Don't you ever_grow up
Just never grow_up
Last night I heard my own
heart beating
Sounded like footsteps
on my stairs
Six months gone and
I'm still reaching
Even_though I know
you're not there
I was playing back a thousand
memories baby
Thinkin bout everything
we've_been through
Maybe i've been going back
too_much lately
When time stood still
and I had you
Come back come_back come_back
to me like
You would you would
if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til
I came out
Come back come_back come_back
to me like
You could you could if you
just said you're sorry
I know that we can work it
out somehow
But if this was a movie
you'd be here by now
I know people change and
these_things happen
But I remember how
it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our
friends are laughing
Cause nothing like
this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down your street
Flashback to the night
when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not
for me and you
Not before I knew how_much
I had to lose
Come back come_back come_back
to me like
You would you would if
this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til
i came out
Come back come_back come_back
to me like
You could you could if you
just said you're sorry
I know that we can work it
out somehow
But if this was a movie
you'd be here by now
If you're out there
if you're somewhere
if you're moving on
I've be waiting_for you ever
since you've_been gone
I just want it back the way it
was before
And i just wanna see you back
at my front_door
And i'd say
Come back come_back come_back
to me like
You would before you said its
not that easy
Before the fight before
i locked you out
But i'd take it all back now
Come back come_back come_back
to me like
You would you would if
this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside
til i came out
Come back come_back come_back
to me like
You could you could if you
just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it
out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd
be here by now
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind_of ending you

Just a_lil' bit_Ayy ayy
Just a_lil' bit_Ayy ayy
Just a_lil' bit
We gon'_have some_fun
I walked through the door with you,
the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it
felt_like home somehow
And I left my scarf
there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car,
getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down
like pieces into place
And I can picture it
after all these_days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay,
but I'm not fine at all
Oh,_oh, oh
'Cause there we are again
on that little town street
You almost ran the red
'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too_well
Photo album on the counter,
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used_to be a little_kid
with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories
'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past,
thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys,
"Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground,
we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down,
"Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"
you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come_back
swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered
where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and
you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing_else I could do
And I forget_about you long_enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again
in the middle_of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too_well
And there we are again
when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret,
but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too_well,
oh-oh-oh-oh
And maybe
we got lost in translation,
maybe I asked for too_much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too_well
And you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name
of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece
of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it_all, all, all
They_say all's well that ends well,
but I'm in a new hell
Every_time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age,
maybe it would've_been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy,
ever-lovely jewel whose shine
reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me
what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad
with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like
you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me
watch the front_door all night,
willin' you to come
And he said,
"It's supposed to be fun
turning twenty-one"
Time won't fly,
it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again,
but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
from that very_first week
'Cause it reminds you of
innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid_of it
'Cause you remember it
all too_well, yeah
'Cause there we are again
when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one
real thing you've ever known
It_was rare, I was there
I remember it all too_well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It_was rare, I was there
I remember it all too_well
And I was never good
at tellin' jokes,
but the punch line goes
"I'll get older,
but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn
broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning
half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise
paint you blue?
Just between us,
did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first
fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too_well
Just between us,
did the love affair
maim you all too well?
Just between us,
do you remember it all too well?
Just between us,
I remember it (Just between us)
all too_well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair,
I was_there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs,
I was_there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer,
I was_there, I was there
It_was rare,
you remember it all too_well
Wind in my hair,
I was_there, I was there
Down the stairs,
I was_there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer,
I was_there, I was there
It_was rare, you remember it
(All too well)
Wind in my hair,
I was_there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs,
I was_there, I was there
Sacred prayer,
I was_there, I was there
It_was rare, you remember it
* Give me one_reason to stay_here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one_reason to stay_here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want to leave you lonely
You gotta make me change my mind *
Baby I got your number
Oh I know that you got mine
You know that I called you
I called too_many times
You can call me baby
You can call me anytime
You got to call me
** Repeat
I don't want no_one to squeeze me
They_might take away my life
I don't want no_one to squeeze me
They_might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me
Oh and rock me through the night
This youthful_heart can love you
And soon give you what you need
I said youthful_heart can love you
Oh and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy
** Repeat
Baby just give me one_reason
Oh give me just one_reason why
Baby just give give me one_reason
Oh give me just one_reason
Why I should stay
Said I told you that I loved you
And there_ain't no more to say
We broke
Everything that was right
We both enjoyed a good fight
And we solved
All the holes we had to breathe
To make the other one leave
And I loved the way you looked_at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone
So I'll shiver like I used_to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used_to
Just for you
And we stole
Every moment we had to
make the other one feel bad
And we hoped that
we could be what we knew
We'd never turn out to be real
And I loved the way you looked_at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone
And I'll shiver like I used_to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used_to
Just for you
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn
And I'll shiver like I used_to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used_to
Just for you
Like I used_to
White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
And they scream
The_worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're just under the upper_hand
And go mad for a_couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she_flies to the Motherland
Or_sells love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
And they scream
The_worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're just under the upper_hand
And go mad for a_couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she_flies to the Motherland
Or_sells love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade_out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class_A Team
Stuck in her_daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately_her face_seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling_like pastries
They scream
The_worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper_hand
Go mad for a_couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold_outside
For_angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For_angels to fly, to fly, to fly
For_angels to die
words mean more at night
like a song
and did you ever notice
the way light means
more_than it did all day long?
words mean more at night
light means more
like your hair and your_face
and your smile
and our bed and the dress
that you wore
so i’ll send you my words
from the corners of my room
and though i write them
by the light of day
please read them
by the light of the moon
and i wish i could leave
my bones and my skin
and float over the tired tired sea
so that i could see you again
maybe you would leave too
and we’d blindly pass each_other
floating over the ocean blue
just to find the warm bed
of our lover
and i’ll send you my words
from the corners of my room
and though i write them
by the light of day
please read them
by the light of the moon
Turn down the lights
turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
inside my head
Lay down with me
tell me no lies
Just hold me close
don't patronize
Don't patronize me
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't
You can't make your heart
feel something it won't
Here in the dark
in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
and I'll feel the power
But you won't
no you won't
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't
I'll close my eyes
then I won't see
The love you don't feel
when you're holding me
Morning will come and
I'll do what's right
Just give me
till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't
You can't make your heart
feel something it won't
Here in the dark
in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and
I'll feel the power
But you won't
no you won't
Cause I can't make you love me
if you don't
Have you ever tried
Have you ever tried to be
Six feet away_from
Your favorite place on earth
But you couldn’t find
But you couldn’t find it in you
To go back in there
Cause when she left
She took the air with her
You don’t wanna know
You don’t wanna know how it feels
When it's coming out of nowhere
Everybody_knows
Everybody_knows how she feels
Before she said that it was over
Oh all my life
I’ve_been the one who fights
For every love I’ve_had
It all ends the same
no matter_how hard I try
Why am I the last to say_goodbye
Have you every tried
Have you ever tried to see
What their lives would be like
If you disappeared from
everyone you loved
And would they even
feel the change
Like you did
when you watched your family
Thirty thousand feet above the sky
Cause when they left
they took the air with them
Pressure in their ears as they fly
All my years
I've tried to stop these tears
For every friend I've lost
It all ends the same
Now all my tears are dry
Why am I the first to say_goodbye
All my life
I've_been the one who hides
From every pain unknown
But it all ends the same
Am I meant to be alone
Why am I the first
Why am I the last
To say_goodbye
you had a bad dream
had a bad dream again
a storm was raging but I
wasn't there to hold your hand
but I promise the moment
you open your eyes
I'll be by your side
you know I love you
I tell you everyday
but you say that love won't
it won't wash_away your pain
but I promise the moment
the tides roll out
we'll find higher ground
I heard them whisper and say
Bad things about you
accusations we_both know are wrong
It's not true what they say about you
It's not true what they say about you
I know you as generous and kind
They were blind with the injustice
of this crazy world
I know you as humble and fair
How can anyone expect you to
Solve all the problems
addressed to you
They had too_many
and your arms too few
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Don't let thеm tell you
don't let_them tеll you who you are
I heard them calling your name
In a way that's supposed to
make you feel bad
For the mess your father made
They want to open your wounds again
Turn the eyes of the world away
From their own well hidden crimes
I want to tell you that I love you
But I know you can't hear me now
I know you can't hear me now
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Don't let_them tell you
don't let_them tell you who you are
Used to pray for rain just to stay inside
You wouldn’t believe it,
every move I made I was terrified
Thought that every road
I took had a bitter end
I just couldn’t see it
I convinced myself trying to trust again
Would be like trying to
make a river run upstream
Trying to make a mountain into a valley
That’s_what your love does to me
You make me feel…
Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closing
Like I never watched love run_away on fire
in the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rolling
Like I never said here’s hoping
I could find me someone whose
good at being real
Who can make me feel wide_open
Like I never had my heart broken
You make me feel like
I’ve never been too_much to handle
Roll the dice you know love is a gamble
Feel like I always had the poorest examples
Like fire in your heart
I’m tryin to relight that candle
My cinderella,
no questioning this shit forever
Pain in written letters,
sheddin’ tears while we sit together
Forget the pressure, know
I love hard I’m sick of lectures
Stuck in rainstorms
I could get used_to this different weather
Broken pieces that was all I had,
girl I promise now you all I got
Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closing
Like I never watched love run_away on fire
in the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rolling
Like I never said here’s hoping
I could find me someone whose
good at being real
Who can make me feel wide_open
Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closing
Like I never watched love run_away on fire
in the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rollin
Like I never said here’s hoping
I could find me someone whose
good at bein real
Who can make me feel wide_open
Like I never had my heart broken
We were both_young when I first_saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing_there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing_pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away_from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
[Verse_2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh,_oh
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away_from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
I got tired_of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
[Breakdown]
And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've_been feeling so alone
I keep waiting_for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
[Chorus]
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll_never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white_dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"
[Outro]
Oh,_oh, oh
Oh,_oh, oh
'Cause we were both_young when I first_saw you
Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while
I was sleeping
And the vision
that was planted in my_brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In_restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar
to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
by the flash of a neon_light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs
that voices never share
And no_one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
'Fools' said I
'You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that
I might teach you
Take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words like
silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed
out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said
'The words of
the prophets are written
on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd
in the sounds of silence
I think it's time, we give it up
And figure_out what's stopping us
From breathing easy and talking straight
The way is clear if you're_ready now
The volunteer is slowing down
And taking time to save himself
The little cracks they escalated
before you knew it was too_late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Baby, if you slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
The little cracks they escalated
And before you knew it was too_late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you'd slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
So plant the thought and watch it grow
Wind it up and let it go
why is that sad look in your eyes
why are you crying
tell me now tell me now
tell me why
you're feeling this way
i hate to see you so down oh baby
is it your heart
oh breakin' all in pieces
makin' you cry
makin' you feel blue
is there anything i can do
why don't you tell me where it
hurts now baby
and I'll do my best
to make it better
I'll do my do my best
to make the tears all go away
just tell me
where it hurts now tell me
and I'll love you
with a love so_tender
and if you let me stay
I'll love all of the hurt away
where are all those tears coming
from why are they fallin'
somebody somebody somebody
let your heart in the cold
you just need somebody
to hold on baby
give me a chance
to put back all the pieces
take your broken_heart
make it just like new
there's so_many things
that i can do
why don't you tell me where it
hurts now baby
and I'll do my best
to make it better
I'll do my do my best
to make the tears all go away
just tell me
where it hurts now tell me
and I'll love you
with a love so_tender
and if you let me stay
I'll love all of the hurt away
is it your heart
oh breakin' all in pieces
makin' you cry
makin' you feel blue
is there anything i can do
why don't you tell me where it
hurts now baby
and I'll do my best

tell me baby tell me
is there anything i can do
just tell me where it
hurts now tell me
and I'll love you
with a love so_tender
and if you let me stay
I'll love all of the hurt away
I don't know
What am I doing here
There's a shadow in my place
Maybe now everything will be so clear
You shed light into this empty_space
And all I am
all I have doesn't even matter now
I can't understand why I feel this way
But I do I do
I just want to love you
when the goings tough
I just want to hold you
when you're not enough
I just want to give you
everything I've got
I do I do
I don't know
What am I sayin' here
There's a hole in my heart
and it's beggin' please
Maybe now everything will be so clear
'Cus you're all I'll ever need
All I know is
I don't want to lose control
I just want to touch your soul
I do I do
I just want to hold you
when the goings tough
I just want to love you
when you're not enough
I just want to give you
all that I can give
I do I do
I just want to kiss you
in the morning sun
I just want to love you
when the day is done
I just want to hold you
just because I can
I do I do
I just want to fold you up
into my arms
I just want to listen to
your beating heart
I just want to love you
just because I do
I do I do
On a wagon bound for market
There's a calf with a mournful eye
High above him, there's a swallow
Winging swiftly through the sky
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer's night
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Donna
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Don
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Donna
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Don
"Stop complaining!" said the farmer
"Who told you a calf to be?
Why don't you have wings to fly with
Like the swallow so proud and free?"
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer's night
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Donna
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Don
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Donna
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Don
Calves are easily bound and slaughtered
Never knowing the reason_why
But whoever treasures freedom
Like the swallow has learned to fly
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer's night
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Donna
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Don
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Donna
Donna,_Donna, Donna,_Don
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot
forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
But what if I told you
the world wouldn't end
If you started showing
what's under your skin?
What if you let_'em all in
on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Oh
Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtain's closed?
Did your Daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama
Sweep it under the rug?
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot
forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
What if I told you
the world wouldn't end
If you started showing
what's under your skin?
What if you let_'em all in
on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you
the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure,
said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles
and shines
And even the homecoming
queen cries (Ooh)
Oh yeah (Ooh)
Even the homecoming
queen cries (Ooh)
Mmm-mmm, mmm (Ooh)
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world
Or do you need more
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for
I'm falling
In all the good_times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void
Or do you need more
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore
I'm falling
In all the good_times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're_far from the shallow_now
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're_far from the shallow_now
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're_far from the shallow_now
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're_far from the shallow_now
There_is a life I lead in this city
Hurrying to cut my teeth
I can take what I need to get by
Doesn’t make it easy
The other piece_of my heart is slow
Somewhere in the great unknown
When I return from the afterglow
Will you carry me like I am whole again?
Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone
Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone
(The feeling is all gone)
(The feeling is all gone)
If I could take you back to my youth
Show you what I wish I knew
My will is strong with a place to lead
In the moment I hung disbelief
The other ring on my wrist is gold
Fairing with the lie we pulled
When I return from my spinning dome
I’m rememberin' the words you told me
Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone
Wait
Hold on
Put me together
Take me back where I belong
I want it all
I had a feeling but the feeling is all gone
(The feeling is all gone)
(The feeling is all gone)
(The feeling is all gone)
Ooh oooh
Ooh oooh
Ooh oooh
Ooh oooh
Dreamin', I must be dreamin'
Or am I really lying_here with you?
Baby, you take me in your arms
And though I'm wide awake,
I know my dream is comin' true
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then
it happens_every time
There I go by,
just fall in love again and when I do
I can't_help myself, I fall in love with you
Magic, it must be magic
The way I hold you
when the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment
when I look into your eyes.
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then
it happens_every time
There I go by,
just fall in love again and when I do
I can't_help myself, I fall in love with you
Can't_help myself, I fall in love with you
I hate you for what you did
and I miss you like a little_kid
I faked it every_time
but that's alright
I can_hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all
You gave me fifteen hundred
to see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time
you let it slide
fell on hard times a year ago
was hoping you would
let it go and you did
I have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
There are no words
in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks
around your room
and while you're bleeding
on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
and sorry that it all
went down like it did
I have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
There are no words
in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
And why do you sing
with an English accent
I guess it's too_late
to change it now
You know I'm never
gonna let you have it
but I will try to drown you out
You said when you
met me you were bored
You said when you
met me you were bored
And you you were
in a band when I was_born
I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean
and live_without
and I want to know
what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or_two
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid
Like: "I_love you"
I can see it in your eyes
That you despise the same_old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true
And never seemed so right before
I practice every day
To find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait
Until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red
And oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid
Like: "I_love you"
The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red
And oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid
Like: "I_love you"
"I_love you"
"I_love you"
"I_love you"
"I_love you"
If you wanna dance then
Dance with me
It's pretty fast but
This_is what you do
at parties right
And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you
Just take it slow
And move your feet to the beat
'Cause if we dance then
You don't have to speak
And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you
Hmmm hmmmm
Pa_pa pa
Pa_pa pa_pa
Never again not even if
Hell freezes over
Not even when nights get long
And I get too lonely
Wasn't askin' wasn't wonderin'
Didn't care where you've_been
Well that strong girl was a gone girl
Soon as you came walkin' in
'Cause here I am here we are
One drink away_from goin' way too_far
Shouldn't want to spend the night
Funny I remember I
Swore you off said i couldn't
If I saw you out no I wouldn't
Get caught drinking with you
Even speakin' with you
No way in hell think of
leavin' with you
But here I am
Maybe I'm weak
if that's what it means
That I keep moving closer
Already know that I'm gonna relapse
And tomorrow start over
Back to silence back to hate you
Back to over and done
Baby I don't need a reason
Better than just because
'Cause here I am here we are
One drink away_from goin' way too_far
Shouldn't want to spend the night
Funny I remember I
Swore you off said i couldn't
If I saw you out no I wouldn't
Get caught drinking with you
Even speakin' with you
No way in hell think of
leavin' with you
But here I am
I should know better no more
No way no how
Said I ain't gonna I don't wanna
It don't mean nothing now
No it don't mean nothing now
No it don't mean nothing now
'Cause here I am here we are
One drink away_from goin' way too_far
Shouldn't want to spend the night
Funny I remember I
Swore you off said i couldn't
If I saw you out no I wouldn't
Get caught drinking with you
Even speakin' with you
No way in hell think of
leavin' with you
But here I am
Could be anywhere
But here I am
Mmm never again not even if
Hell freezes over
[Verse_1]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used_to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me
[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no_amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Verse_2]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
But I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no_amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
I lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around
And see that we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried, and I watched a part_of myself die
'Cause no_amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Outro]
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me
You said it in a simple way
4 AM the second day
How strange that
I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One_last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster_than the plane
that took you
And this is when the feeling_sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come_back be here
I guess you're in New_York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back be here come_back be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so_much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't_help but
wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling_sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come_back be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back be here come_back be here
This_is falling in love
in the cruellest way
This_is falling for you
when you are worlds away
In New_York be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that
you're not around
This_is when the feeling_sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come_back be here
I guess you're in New_York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back be here come_back be here
Oh-oh_oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh_oh-oh
Come back be here
Come back be here
A river_flows one_direction
And fishes they follow the flow
What if one tired to mention
that there was much more
to explore
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
A dragonfly heard the message
darkness was home for the start
it spread its wings to the surface
bright colours set them apart
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am I have a plan
I’m living free
you don’t know where I’ll land
Here I am
It’ll be fine by dusk light
I’m telling you baby
These things eat at your bones
and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head
between my collar and jaw
I don’t know much
but there’s no weight at all
And I’m damned_if I do and
I’m damned_if I don’t
‘Cause if I say I miss you
I know that you won’t
But I miss you in the mornings
when I see the sun
Something in the orange tells me
we’re not done
To you I’m just a man,
to me you’re all I am
Where the hell am I ‘supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me
you’re never coming_home
I need to hear you say
you’ve been waitin’ all night
There’s orange dancing
in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles
when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancing
this wood used_to creak
To you I’m just a man,
to me you’re all I am
Where the hell am I ‘supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me
you’re never coming_home
To you I’m just a man,
to me you’re all I am
Where the hell am I ‘supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me
you’re never coming_home
If you leave today I’ll
just stare_at the way
The orange touches all things around
Grass trees and dew,
how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around
I see you drinking alone
All by yourself in the corner
And that just ain't right
You should be out on the floor
The cover band singing for ya
Having the time of your life
I don't know what he did
But I can tell you this
Ain't worth the tears in your eyes
Neon_cowgirl
Don't you cry
Don't you know you were born to shine
Rain stops falling
Hearts unbreak
So let that cowboy ride away
It won't be like this forever
Ain't_no storm that you can't weather
Neon_cowgirl
Don't you cry
That pair_of boots you got on
They should be taking you dancing
Under these broadway lights
You oughta know that you're stronger
Than the drink in your hand is
So hold your head up high
Way you light up a room
Don't know what kinda fool
Could ever tell you goodbye
Neon_cowgirl
Don't you cry
Don't you know you were born to shine
Rain stops falling
Hearts unbreak
So let that cowboy ride away
It won't be like this forever
Ain't_no storm that you can't weather
Neon_cowgirl
Don't you cry
I know it's been a while
Since you showed off your smile
And all that blue in your eyes
Neon_cowgirl
Don't you cry
Don't you know you were born to shine
Rain stops falling
And hearts unbreak
So let that cowboy ride away
It won't be like this forever
Ain't_no storm that you can't weather
Neon_cowgirl
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Neon cowgirl, don't you cry
I'm two months deep in therapy
Been finally getting sleep
My friends quit checking up on me
'Cause I'm back on my feet
I'm doing more_than getting by
Ive been seeing a stand-up guy
It's the middle_of the night
And my phone starts ringing and
Here you come again, and there you go
No_coincidence, you always know
When I'm moving on, you move back in
With a half-ass, "Sorry, how you been?"
Why do you do it? Do you just hate losing?
Here you come again, who could it be
It's 3 a.m., no caller ID
I don't need to see your name
Who else would drunk-call me this late?
Surprise, surprise, you haven't changed
I'm sure, you're sure I'll_pick up
And I shouldn't want to, but I do
You know me too_well, damn you
Why do I want to? I shouldn't want to
Well, here you come again, and there you go
No_coincidence, you always know
When I'm moving on, you move back in
With a half-ass, "Sorry, how you been?"
Why do you do it? Do you just hate losing?
Here you come again, who could it be?
It's 3 a.m., no caller ID
Don't you get tired_of hurting me?
I'm tired_of hurting me
I'm tired_of hurting me
So I let it ring, I let it ring
Here you come again, and there you go
No_coincidence, you always know
When I'm moving on, you move back in
Keep your half-ass, "Sorry, how you been?"
I know why you do it, you just hate losing
Here you come again, who could it be?
It's just you, no caller ID
It's just you, no caller ID
It's just you, no caller ID
Used to spend my nights
out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love
I'd known
But you rescued me
from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back
from bein' too_far gone
You're as smooth
as Tennessee_whiskey
You're as sweet
as strawberry_wine
You're as warm
as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned
on your love all the time
I've_looked for love
in all the same_old places
Found the bottom
of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out
your heart
I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin'
like your love to get me high
And you're as smooth
as Tennessee_whiskey
You're as sweet
as strawberry_wine
You're as warm
as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned
on your love all the time
You're as smooth
as Tennessee_whiskey
You're as sweet
as strawberry_wine
You're as warm
as a glass of brandy
And honey I stay stoned
on your love all the time
You're as smooth
as Tennessee_whiskey
Tennessee_whiskey
Tennessee_whiskey
You're as smooth
as Tennessee_whiskey
Tennessee_whiskey
Tennessee_whiskey
It's been a hard time a long day
Our minds they play over
and over again
And I call myself a friend
While you call yourself a stranger
We float upon the hills
and on the grass
Speak words that
they will hear but
never understand
And I'm writing this in a bad way
No one can hear
what my head says
Oh no
take what you want from me
Because I can't bear it
I find it hard to breathe
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think_about
it too_much
If you ask if I'm fine
then I'd say_yes
But I am lying through my teeth
and they all know that
I am flawed
I am flawed
Still you float upon
the hills and on the grass
Dreaming only of the time
that's soon to pass
And I'd say I just exist
in this darken world I live in
Oh no don't come near me
Because I can't bear it
I find it hard to breathe
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think_about it too_much
Don't we all have our doubts on love
Don't we all think_about it too_much
It ain't_no use to sit and
wonder why babe
It don't matter anyhow
An' it ain't_no use to sit and
wonder why babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows
at the break of dawn
Look_out your window
and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think_twice it's all right
It ain't_no use in turnin'
on your light babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't_no use in turnin'
on your light babe
I'm on the dark_side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin'
you would do or say
To try and make me
change my mind and stay
We never did too_much
talkin' anyway
So don't think_twice it's all right
It ain't_no use in callin' out
my name gal
Like you never did_before
It ain't_no use in callin' out
my name gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin'
all the way down the road
I once loved a woman
a child I'm told
I give her my heart
but she wanted my soul
But don't think_twice
it's all right
So long honey babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word babe
So I just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better
but I don't mind
You just kinda
wasted my precious time
But don't think_twice it's all right
looking at the sea
again tides that rise
and fall and then rise
again my love floats like
a feather in the wind catch me
if you can catch me
i don't even know
what just i'd do if you
found your way back
through clear all the cob
webs that we weaved
making room for you and me
there's a road to my heart
follow signs through
the ride when you see
all the lights glowing bright
you know you found me
looking at the city escape
tiny little bubbles sparkling
in the night i don't think
its ever too_late to cut
the ties that bond us to our lies
i don't even know
what just i'd say if you found
your way back clear
all the cob webs
that we made wishing
for you to stay
there's a road to my heart
following signs through
the ride when you see
all the lights glowing bright
you know you found me
looking at the sea
again tides that rise and fall
and then rise
again my love floats
like a feather
in the wind catch me
if you can catch me

When_Emma falls in love she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When_Emma falls in love she_calls up her mom
Jokes about how this one can go wrong
She waits and takes her time
Cause little miss sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When_Emma falls in love I know that boy will never be the same
Cause she's the kind_of girl that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew_up in a small_town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, some times I wish I was her
When_Emma falls in love it's all in her face
Hangs on her like stars in outer_space
When_Emma falls in love she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these_years
When_Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
Cause when Emma_falls in love she's leadin' for keeps
She won't walk_away unless she absolutely have to leave
Cause she's the kind_of girl that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew_up in a small_town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, some times I wish I was her
And she's so muttered when she's in LA
She ran through herself and love the way I did
And she'll call you out, she put you in your place
When_Emma falls in love, I'm lovin' it
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hands
Now he'll be her shelter when it_rains
Little does he know his whole world's about to change
Cause she's the kind_of girl that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew_up in a small_town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, some times I wish I was her
Yeah between me and you, some times I wish I was her
older chests reveal themselves
like a crack in a wall
starting small and grow in time
and we always seem
to need the help
of someome else

and some things

like time there's always time
on my my mind
so pass me by i'll be fine

older gents sit on the fence
with their cap in hand
looking grand
they watch their city change
children scream or so it seems
louder than before
our of doors and into stores
with bigger names
mama tried to wash their faces
but these kids
they lost their graces
and daddy lost at the races
too_many times
she broke_down the other day
yeah you know
some things in life may change
but some things they stay the same
like time there is always time
on my mind
so pass me by i'll be fine

on my mind

just give me time
Now I'm in town
break it down
thinking of
making a new sound
Playing a different show
every night
in front_of a new crowd
That's you now
ciao seems that
life is great now
See me lose focus
as I sing to you loud
I can't no
I won't hush
I say the words
that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See I'm true
my songs are where
my heart is
I'm like glue
I stick to other artists
I'm not you
now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
and move to greener pastures
See I'm real I do it all
it's all me
I'm not fake
don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put
give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to
sort of suffocate me
'Cos you need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing I write my own tune
and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith
to make the tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer
you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits
and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast
I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and
I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with
the way I act right
I can't last
if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a
product of my genre
My mind will always
be stronger
than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit
that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories
that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically
I'm demonstrating
When I perform live feels_like
I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise
when some fella filmed me
Young singer writer
like a Gabriella Cilmi
'Cos you need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me
'Cos with the lyrics
I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till
my name is in lights
At stadium heights
with Damien Rice
on red carpets
now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young
I know my brother's
gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height
and I'm going hyper
Never be anything
but a singer songwriter
Yeah the game's over
but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track
without a loop pedal
People think that
I'm bound to blow up
I've_done around
about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus
I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics
when I'm singing them out
From day one
I've_been prepared
with VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
giving a dose of
what the future holds
'Cos it's another day
plus I keep
my last name forever
keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking
into other_people's tunes
when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant
in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes
using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack
aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rushsack
aiming for majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack
still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor
for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy
in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace
and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows
if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke never growing up
call me Rufio
Melody music maker
reading all the papers
They_say I'm up and coming like
I'm fucking in an elevator
'Cos you need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you
You need me man
I don't need you at all
You need me man
I don't need you
Once_upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold_onto the night
You looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please_tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare_at the phone
he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
when he said forever and always
Oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that
cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
but I don't anymore
And I stare_at the phone
he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
when he said forever and always
Oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby
I don't think so
Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
'Cause it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here and it_rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
Oh I stare_at the phone
he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
when we said forever and always
And it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there
when you said forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah
How_many roads
must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
How_many seas must
a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand
Yes_n how many_times
must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned
The_answer my friend
is blowin' in the wind
The_answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes_n how many_years
can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea
Yes_n how many_years
can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free
Yes_n how many_times
can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see
The_answer my friend
is blowin’ in the wind
The_answer is blowin’ in the wind
Yes_n how many_times
must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
Yes_n how many ears
must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
Yes_n how many deaths
will it take till_he knows
that too_many people have died
The_answer my friend
is blowin’ in the wind
The_answer is blowin’ in the wind
Once_upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used_to raise a glass or_two
Remember how we laughed
away the hours
And dreamed of
all the great things we would do
Those_were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and
sure to have our way
La_la la_la
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say
Those_were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those_were the days
oh yes those were the days
La_la la_la
Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used_to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me
Those_were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those_were the days
oh yes those were the days
La_la la_la
Through the door there
came familiar laughter
I saw your_face and
heard you call my name
Oh my friend
we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts
the dreams are still the same
Those_were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those_were the days
oh yes those were the days
La_la la_la
It_was only a smile
But my heart it went wild
I wasn't_expecting that
Just a delicate kiss
Anyone could've missed
I wasn't_expecting that
Did I misread the sign
Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't_expecting that
You spent the night in my bed
You woke_up and you said
Well I wasn't_expecting that
I thought love wasn't_meant to last
I thought you were
just passing_through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve
somebody like you
I wasn't_expecting that
It_was only a word
It_was almost misheard
I wasn't_expecting that
But it came without fear
A month turned into a year
I wasn't_expecting that
I thought love wasn't_meant to last
Honey I thought you were
just passing_through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve
somebody like you
I wasn't_expecting that
Oh and isn't it strange
How a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without that innocent kiss
What a life I'd have missed
If you'd not took a chance
On a little romance
When I wasn't_expecting that
Time doesn't take long
Three kids up and gone
I wasn't_expecting that
When the nurses they came
Said It's come_back again
I wasn't_expecting that
Then you closed your eyes
You took my heart by_surprise
I wasn't_expecting that
Well I just like to sing
Forget everything and
write of colour and string
Talk of life in the sea
And none_of that will
ever be healthy for society
Mmm
Teacher tell us when
people hurt the people
every now and then
What’s that all about
Hiding one another
finding no way out
What a time what a time
Mmm
Who am I honey riddle me that
How can I say what’s
white and what’s black
Who am I
got some knuckles to crack
Everybody’s riding on my back
She_said life is like this fruit
Wholesome
good and green at the root
But if it drops to the floor
What you get is bruises
and a love of a rotten
core-ore-ore-ore ah-ah-ah-ah-mm
Core-ore-ore-ore ah-ah-ah-ah-mm
Who am I honey riddle me that
How can I say what’s
white and what’s black
Who am I
got some knuckles to crack
Everybody’s riding on my back
Wearing animal skin
With no state to be in
Choosing good over sin
How sweet
Wearing animal skin
With no state to be in
Choosing good over sin
How sweet
Hold my breath, never check the time
My heart beats when I stand in line
Waitin' on the sun to fall behind
Movin' to the place where we unwind
Blinking streetlights blurring by
Waitin' on the stars to start their climb
On the way back to you
My legs get away_from me
Mindin' not a single stair
Floating
Back to you
Tried and true patience cannot be tried
Justice be done, justice, I'm not blind
Let me have the moon fallin' bright
Even evening evens to a dark
Light of lightning, light it with a spark
Let her outline shine out of sight
On the way back to you
My legs get away_from me
Mindin' not a single stair
Floating
Back to you
I float back to you
Am I enough
Or am I just a shame?
Should I go
Or should I stay?
Silence is creeping
Think of something to say
You stutter and mumble
Today's just not your day
They smile and laugh like people do
Yet you're standing_there
without clue
I'm floating away
just like a balloon
I'm fit to burst
But they can't see that it's you
They_say they'll hold on tight
But is that really the truth?
If I'm let go now
I'll just fade to blue
"How was your day?"
"It was fine I guess"
The words you say
Don't match what's in your head
Do they like me?
Am I their friend?
Or am I a nuisance
They smile and laugh
like people do
Yet you're standing_there
without clue
I'm floating away
just like a balloon
I'm fit to burst
But they can't see that it's you
They_say they'll hold on tight
But is that really the truth?
If I'm let go now
I'll just fade to blue
Mmm
Mmm
Could paint the sun and the moon
And the stars straight down from the sky
Carve your likeness in stone
Down to the light that shines in your eyes
Build a church in your honor
Stained glass windows facing east
Loving you
Loving you is my masterpiece
Love you for who you are
I love you for who you may never be
From downtown all the way up to 142nd street
And all of my possessions mean
less than the very least
Loving you
Loving you is my masterpiece
There's_no time like now
There_is no place like here
So throw your loving arms_around me, dear
And I'll lean on you like a beggar
Leans upon the moonlit streets
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you is my masterpiece
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems_like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing_else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The_stakes are high, the water's_rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't_care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The_stakes are high, the water's_rough
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty_little mind
People_throw rocks_at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The_stakes are high, the water's_rough
But this love is ours
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are
jealous He says everything
I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful
tonight And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss_screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and
I'm_cursing your name
You're so in love that you act
insane And that's the way I
loved you Breakin' down
and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kinda_rush
And I never knew I could feel
that much And that's
the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he_calls exactly
when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss_screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm_cursing your
name You're so in love
that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kinda_rush
And I never knew I could feel
that much And that's
the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's_not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling
anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated got away
by some mistake and now
I miss_screaming and fighting
and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm_cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kinda_rush
And I never knew I could
feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
And that's the way I loved you
Never_knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
Mmm-mm_mm-mm
Mmm-mm_mm-mm
Mmm-mm_mm-mm yeah
Hey_Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
we were talking
I didn't say half the things
I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing
rocks_at your window
I'll be the one waiting
there even when it's cold
Hey_Stephen boy
you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't_help it
if you look like an_angel
Can't_help it if I wanna kiss
you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've_been feeling_since I met you
Can't_help it if there's_no one_else
Mmm I can't_help myself
Hey_Stephen
I've_been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've_seen it all so I thought
But I never seen nobody
shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk
way you say my name
It's beautiful wonderful
don't you ever change
Hey_Stephen
why are people always leaving
I think you
and I should stay the same
'Cause I can't_help it
if you look like an_angel
Can't_help it if I wanna
kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've_been feeling_since I met you
Can't_help it if there's_no one_else
Mmm I can't_help myself
They're dimming the street lights
you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now
so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine
shine shine
Hey_Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls well
they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you
Ha-ha-ha
I can't_help it
if you look like an_angel
Can't_help it if I wanna kiss
you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've_been feeling_since I met you
Can't_help it if there's_no one_else
Mmm I can't_help myself
If you look like an_angel
Can't_help it if I wanna kiss you
in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've_been feeling_since I met you
Can't_help it if there's_no one_else
Mmm I can't_help myself
Ah-uh myself
Mmm-mm I can't_help myself
I can't_help myself
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm-mm_mm-mm
Mmm-mm_mm-mm
Mmm-mm_mm-mm
Almost heaven, West_Virginia,
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River.
Life_is old there,
Older than the trees,
Younger than the mountains
browin' like a breeze.
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong:
West_Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home,_country roads.
All my memories gather round her,
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine,
Teardrop in my eye.
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home,_country roads.
I hear her voice, in the morning how she_calls me,
Radio reminds me of my home far_away
And drivin'down the road I get a feelin'
I should been home yesterday, yesterday
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home,_country roads.
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home,_country roads.
Take me home,_country roads.
Another day goes by
Without the ones left behind
Those days were
swallowed by the nights
When I was lost in thought
with you in my mind
So just take my hand
and let's run_away
Yeah that'll be the day
When I find my soul mate
So baby please just
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's_as beautiful
or as compatible
Can't_get enough of this life
it's so wonderful
Nothing's_as wonderful as you
Everyday I just can't_wait to
see you in the morning
and in the afternoon
Or catch you during your break
and we can share a drink or_two
Since you were away
I had to find some things to do
So I wrote this song dedicated to you
The sight of you just
makes my heartbeat stop
You got me shaking
I'm not faking I'm about to drop
Oh I'm about to drop
So baby please just
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's_as beautiful
or as compatible
Can't_get enough of this life
it's so wonderful
Nothing's_as wonderful as you
Baby you've_got my heart knocking
You got me head over heels
there_ain't no stopping us now
there_ain't no stopping us now
'Cause you know you're everything
I need and more
I can't ask for more
So baby please just
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's_as beautiful
or as compatible
Can't_get enough of this life
it's so wonderful
Nothing's_as wonderful
follow me call on me
Oh you know I want you so badly
Nothing's_as beautiful
or as compatible
Can't_get enough of this life
it's so wonderful
Nothing's_as wonderful as
Nothing's_as wonderful as
Nothing's_as wonderful as you
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little scotch on the rocks
And I'm fine I'm fine
But when I taste_tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor
in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky_high in Colorado
you lips_pressed
against the bottle
Swearing on a bible baby
I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste_tequila
I can kiss somebody brand_new
And not even think_about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby your memory
It only hits me this hard
But when I taste_tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor
in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky_high in Colorado
you lips_pressed
against the bottle
Swearing on a bible baby
I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste_tequila
Oo ohh
When I taste_tequila
I ain't even drunk
I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love
How I need your love
Yes it sinks me
When I taste_tequila
When I taste_tequila
But when I taste_tequila
Baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor
in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky_high in Colorado
you lips_pressed
against the bottle
Swearing on a bible baby
I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste_tequila
Oo ohh
When I taste_tequila
Oohh
When I taste_tequila
God damn knew it from the start
Wrapped up in loss tonight
Can you figure it out before it breaks our hearts?
I don't, I don't know how we fell apart
Now I am stuck and silent
The weight of time on our shoulders
[Chorus]
Darling I feel I'm falling down, down
Darling I feel I'm falling down, down
Cause it's not_right, it's not_right, it's too hard
It's not_right, It's not_right, it's just too hard
[Verse
Always felt this could get dark
Held on 'cause things change fast
I'm sorry that I didn't help at all
Who knew we could lose it all
[Chorus]
Darling I feel I'm falling down, down
Darling I feel I'm falling down, down
Cause it's not_right, it's not_right, it's too hard
It's not_right, It's not_right, t's just too hard
[Bridge]
I will_wait, I will_wait, I will_wait, I will wait
I know, I know
I will wait I will wait I will wait I will wait
I know I know
[Chorus]
Darling I feel I'm falling down, down
Darling I feel I'm falling down
Cause it's not_right, it's not_right, it's too hard
It's not_right, It's not_right, it's just too hard
[Bridge]
I will_wait, I will_wait, I will_wait, I will wait
I know, I know (It's just too hard)
I will_wait, I will_wait, I will_wait, I will wait
I know, I know (It's just too hard)
All my friends finally convinced
Me to get out of the house
To help me forget, to help me move on
Then I heard you're back in town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that
you were coming so
I should_probably go to bed
I should_probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should_probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning
in the morning
I'll be calling I'll be calling
Saying sorry for the things I said
So I, yeah
I should_probably go to bed
So I don't undo the got over you
That it took so long to find
'Cause all it would take
Is seeing your_face and I'd forget
I should_probably go to bed
I should_probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should_probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning
in the morning
I'll be calling I'll be calling
Saying sorry for the things I said
So I, yeah
I should_probably go to bed
Before I question my decision
Is it love I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know I don't
Have the self-control
To walk_away if you walk in
Oh
I know, I know, I know, I know
I should_probably go to bed
Ooh-ah, I'm all up in my head
I'm all up in my head
Ooh-ah, I should go to bed go to bed
Ooh-ah, I'm all up in my head
go to bed, go to bed
Ooh-ah, I should go to bed
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that
you were coming so
I should_probably go to bed
Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know
I'll always wanna be there
Holding your hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through
In everything you do
[Chorus]
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right (Make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
(Oh, let me be there)
[Verse_2]
Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
That's how I know
I'll always wanna be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on, here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there
[Chorus]
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right (Make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
(Oh, let me be there)
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right (Make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
(Let me be there)
All I ask you is let me be there
(Let me be there)

Chorus
I got_wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal_with myself tonight
My_thoughts get_drowned until I feel alright
I keep_drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got_wasted
I got_wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal_with myself tonight
My_thoughts get_drowned until I feel alright
I keep_drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got_wasted
Verse_1
Repeat the cycle every day, I gotta start with a drink
My life been getting sorta crazy and I don't wanna think
I look myself right in the mirror and I don't even blink
Then I get angry, take the rest and pour it right in the sink
I know where this road goes
Alcohol ain't my friend, but I keep_drinkin' 'cause these demons roam
And follow me 'round everywhere I go
It clouds my mind and soul, it turns my heart cold
But I keep_drinkin' 'cause it makes me feel like I'm not alone
I'm havin' problems, my pride won't let me reach out
Lookin' at this bottle, havin' nothin' but doubt
Don't wanna drink, but it keeps comin' around and around and around
Chorus
I got_wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal_with myself tonight
My_thoughts get_drowned until I feel alright
I keep_drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got_wasted
I got_wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal_with myself tonight
My_thoughts get_drowned until I feel alright
I keep_drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got_wasted
Verse_2
I know I need to quit I need to quit
I gotta do better I gotta do better
Example to these kids Example to these kids
'Cause they watchin' when I'm in there, but I'm scared
'Cause I've_been chasin' the man that I am when I start to drink
He's cocky, confident and he don't give a damn what you think
This world is beatin' me down, it has pushed me right to the brink
I take a shot every_time because man it helps me escape
I'm takin' care of these people, but no_one takes care of me
I wanna talk to somebody, but I feel no_one relates
I need better now, I think I've lost my way
I'm havin' battles with faith, it's painted right on my face
I hope better times are comin', no chase but I'm still runnin'
I gotta take control, and I won't stop for nothin'
Dear God, this is my test, promise that I'll do my best
Just help me with this pain I feel and pressure that is on my chest
Chorus
I got_wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal_with myself tonight
My_thoughts get_drowned until I feel alright
I keep_drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got_wasted
I got_wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal_with myself tonight
My_thoughts get_drowned until I feel alright
I keep_drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got_wasted
Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used_to be great
They used_to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too_far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now
Ooh,_ooh
Ooh,_ooh
Ooh (Ah, ah)
Ooh (Ah, ah)
Ooh
My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look_at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screaming at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me
My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me
I will just let you down
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now
Girl, when you called it quits
You coulda done it right
You coulda left this town out of it
When you said goodbye
You ruined everything I love
Ripped my heart right out my chest
Girl, it's like there_ain't nothing_left
You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire
Can't hit that corner bar
Can't even ride them roads
Don't know my way around this place
I can't see through the smoke
Piled up every memory
Yeah, you took the good with all the bad
Why'd you have to strike that match
And set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire
Ain't_nothing left for me
In this old nothing town
Guess all we'll be is ashes on the ground
So, I watch it burn, burn, burn on down
Ain't_nothing I can hold on to right_now
You set my
You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire (oh-oh)
You set my world on fire (you set my world on fire)
You set my world on fire (yeah)
You set my world on fire (oh)
You set my world on fire
There's a road I'd like to tell you about,
lives in my hometown
Lake_Shore Drive the road is called
and it'll take you up or down
From rats on up to riches,
fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along
the way help you right on by
And the blue lights shining
with a heavenly grace
help you right on by
And there_ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running_south on Lake_Shore Drive
heading_into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday_night trouble_bound
And it starts up north from Hollywood,
water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up,
throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green
if your mind is feeling fine
There_ain't no finer place to be
than running Lake_Shore Drive
And there's_no peace of mind
or place you see riding
on Lake_Shore Drive
And there_ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running_south on Lake_Shore Drive
heading_into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday_night trouble_bound
And it's Friday_night
and you're looking clean,
too early to start the rounds
A ten-minute ride
from the Gold Coast back,
make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning
and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind
and Lake_Shore Drive,
tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine
in the morning time,
tomorrow is another day
Woo
And there_ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running_south on Lake_Shore Drive
heading_into town
Just snaking on by on LSD,
Friday_night trouble_bound
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed_in everything
And everybody believed_in you?
It's alright, just wait and see
Your_string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
You're_still an_innocent
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught_up to you?
It's alright, just wait and see
Your_string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
It's okay, life is a tough_crowd
32 and still_growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're_still an_innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Everyone of us has messed_up too, ooh,_ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too_late to be brand_new
Oh,_oh, oh,_oh, oh,_oh
It's alright, just wait and see
Your_string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
It's okay, life is a tough_crowd
32 and still_growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're_still an_innocent
You're_still an_innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too_late to get it back
I'm gonna love you
like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
Well I guess when you met me
That it was just one
of those things
But don't you ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
if you let me
You're gonna love me
like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
unhappy together
Won't that be fine
Day may be cloudy or sunny
We're either in or
we're out of the money
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
You're gonna love me
like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
unhappy together
Won't that be fine
Day may be cloudy or sunny
We're either in or
we're out of the money
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
There's somethin bout the way
The street looks
when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna
ask you to dance right there
In the middle_of the
parking lot Yeah
We're drivin down the road
I wonder_if you know
I'm tryin so hard
not to get caught_up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin me want you
And I don't know how
it gets_better than this
You take my hand and drag me
head first Fearless
And I don't know why
but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my
best dress Fearless
So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road

Cause I honestly believed_in you
Holding on The days drag on
Stupid girl I should have known

I was a dreamer before you
went and let me down
Now it's too_late for you
And your white_horse
to come around
Baby I was naive
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't wanna be in love
You had to fight to have the
upper_hand I had so_many dreams
About you and me Happy endings
Now I know I'm not a princess
this ain't a fairy_tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep
off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood

I was a dreamer before you
went and let me down
Now it's too_late for you
And your white_horse
to come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness
begging for me
Just like I always wanted but
I'm so sorry Cause I'm not your
princess this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
This_is a big world

for you and your white_horse
Now its too_late for you
and your white_horse
to catch me now
Try and catch me now

Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More_than a memory
More_than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you's
Me and you baby
We'll walk in their footsteps
We'll build our own family
One_day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it's all of me
all of you
Just take my hand and
I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
For worse_or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
This life will go by in the blink_of an_eye
But I wouldn't wanna spend it
without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth's gonna shake
But I'll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it's all of me
all of you
Just take my hand and
I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
For worse_or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
Someday we'll wake_up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won't trade for nothin' this life that we built
I'll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
For worse_or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll_build this love from the ground up
From the ground up
Pack yourself a toothbrush dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip
take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
I was not born to drown
baby come on
Forget what Father Brennan said
We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she_wakes
We'll have driven through
the state
We'll have driven through
the night
baby come on
If the sun don't shine
on me today
And if the subways
flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down
and dig your grave
Or will you rail against
your dying day
And when we looked outside
couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent
is it your parents
Or is hard work dear
holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that
If the sun don't shine
on me today
If the subways flood and
bridges break
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress
yes wear something nice
Decide on me yea decide on us
Oh_oh oh Illinois Illinois
Pack yourself a toothbrush dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip
take all of your savings out
Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light
we'll see
No I won't be afraid
Oh I won't be afraid
Just as long_as you stand
Stand_by me
So darlin' darlin'
Stand_by me oh stand_by me
Just as long_as you stand
Stand_by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble
to the sea
I won't cry I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long_as you stand
Stand_by me
And darlin' darlin'
Stand_by me oh stand_by me
Oh stand now stand_by me
Stand_by me
Whenever you're in trouble
won't you stand_by me
Won't you stand now
Just as long_as you stand
Stand_by me
darlin'
Just as long_as you stand
Stand_by me
Trying not to hold in my safety
Prisoner to my miracle save me
From the roof
that I built myself gave me
Only thing
that I didn't want more of
Was the feeling
I couldn't escape it
Waiting tables
at a minute complaining
That the phone would start ringing
But lately
My soul's
Looking_for a better way to deal
with all the little changes
That keep freaking me out
Wouldn't hurt to figure_out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
Sitting in the middle_of a city
with a million strangers
And it's getting too loud
Wouldn't hurt to figure
out a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
So I don't let me down
And so I don't let me down
Got no time to be overthinking
Can the thoughts
in my head be the demons
That wanna drive me away
from believing
In the things
that I was so sure of
Had to lie and defy
Be my savior
Emphasize in the lights
and my failures
Cuz it's not black
and white in this nature
When the plane lands I'm still
Looking_for a better way to deal
with all the little changes
That keep freaking me out
Wouldn't hurt to figure_out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
Sitting in the middle_of a city
with a million strangers
And it's getting too loud
Wouldn't hurt to figure_out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
So I don't let me down
And so I don't let me down
So I don't let me down
And so I don't let me
Cuz I keep thinking
When the sun gets_better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
And I keep thinking
When the sun gets_better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
And oh I keep thinking
When the sun gets_better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
And no I can't keep thinking
When the sun gets_better
I'll be dancing on my fears
from yesterday
Cuz I'm still looking_for a better
Way to deal
with all the little changes
That keep freaking me out
Wouldn't hurt to figure_out
a better way of imitating
So I don't let me down
If you got the will to do it
But you lack the skills
to do it good
Ask for help
If you got a team behind you
But you lack a leader
inside of you
Ask for help
Why is it so crucial who says
if only it gets sung
Why is it so crucial who does
if only it gets done_done done
Wouldn't it be nice if you win
To know you couldn't have gotten
there on your own
Wouldn't it be nice if you lose
To value a choir to sing
the blues with you
Why is it so crucial who says
if only it gets sung
Why is it so crucial who does
if only it gets done_done done
You can leave this place
You can leave this town and
Never look down
Fly on by on
that fancy flying machine
Take me there girl
Take me where I wanna go
To the place
where we belong together
My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha ye-eah
my baby got all of me
My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha ye-eah
my baby got all of me
Hm I see her across the room
She's dancing like the moon just
Tipped to the sky
she's shining bright
She takes my hand
She takes me where I wanna go
To the place
where we belong together
My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha ye-eah
my baby got all of me
My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha ye-eah

My baby like to float
down the river
My baby like to watch
the treeline fall away
With the sky
my baby got all of me
My baby like to take me dancin'
My baby like to drink all the wine
A-ha ye-eah
my baby got all of me
All of me all of me
Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day,
but tonight I drink
You say I gotta get over you
and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options
and take your pick
I can either_burn the bar down
Or I can take your number
out my phone
I can give you up right_now
And never want you back long
as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you,
want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl,
but I'm only quittin' one_thing at a time
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories
I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey,
some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop lovin' you?
Hey, what you want me to do?
I can either_burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out
my phone
I can give you up right_now
And never want you back long
as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you,
want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl,
but I'm only quittin' one_thing at a time
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
I ain't_no Superman,
I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on,
then I need me somethin' in my hand
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
And if you ain't comin' back
I can either_burn the bar down
Or I can take your number
out my phone
I can give you up right_now
And never want you back
long_as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you,
want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl,
but I'm only quittin' one_thing at a time
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
You wrote you're in pain
Cheap thrills don’t ever last
I am tired_of this foolishness I'll realign my stars
I don't have much
Sorry I haven’t been too good
Your love it means the world the two of you our brotherhood
You don't need no saving need only to be_brave
We can't move your mountains but we can hold your hand
You'll bloom in health and color with grace you'll come of age
We need you to be_brave now, need you to be_brave
You wrote you're afraid
The end you cannot see
There_is those who'll make a choice
And there is those who'll clasp to ease
Seen all your scars
They color all you’ve done
And thank you for those helping hands
In times when there were none
You don’t need no saving need only to be_brave
We can't move your mountains but we can hold your hand
You’ll bloom in health and color with grace you'll come of age
We need you to be_brave now, need you to be_brave
Please treat yourself kind
Give yourself a gentle year
The next lines we'll receive from you
Will tell the storm has cleared
I'm no longer in pain
Cheap thrills they did not last
I tired_of my foolishness I realigned my stars
You don’t need no saving need only to be_brave
We can't move your mountains but we can hold your hand
You'll bloom in health and color with grace you'll come of age
We need you to be_brave now, need you to be_brave
You don't need no saving need only to be_brave
We can't move your mountains but we can hold your hand
You'll bloom in health and color with grace you'll come of age
We need you to be_brave now, need you to be_brave
Need you to be_brave
Need you to be_brave
Need you to be_brave
Need you to be_brave
My cards are on the table, yours are in your hands
Chances are tonight you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
And the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson," foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
You know how to keep me waiting, I know how to act_like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation but I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder it stars thinking you'll come around
And maybe someday when we're older this is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every morning while you're watching the news
But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson," foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will have to learn the hard way instead of walking out
Now I'm sliding down the wall with my head in my hands
Saying, "How could I not see the signs?"
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screaming in the silence
And the voices in my head are telling me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson," foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love that ain't never gonna come
You will have to learn the hard way instead of walking out
Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sitting 'round waiting_for confessions of love, they ain't never gonna come
And thinking he's the one, you should've been walking out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love, when all is said and done
He just wasn't the one, no, he just wasn't the one
Yeah I know that we just met
So pardon my drunk confidence
And I know you don't know me yet
But my heart skipped 10 steps ahead
Yeah you can call me crazy
But I think maybe
We should start forever right_now
We should get_married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little_chapel
Hire_us an_Elvis
Pink_limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking_champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white_dress
I could rent a cheap_suit
Feed_each other_wedding cake
Book a little_honeymoon
7_days in Paris
Yeah I'm talking_Tennessee
Ain't_no point in waiting
Baby I'm just saying
We should get_married
Yeah we should (Ooh)
Oh-yeah
Oh, baby, we should get married, uh-huh
We could stay_here for one_more drink
Or we could double down on some pawn shop rings
Give a heads up to your mom and dad
Or we could let_'em know when we get back
I hear them church_bells ringing
The choir singing
See you walking down the aisle
We should get_married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little_chapel
Hire_us an_Elvis
Pink_limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking_champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white_dress
I could rent a cheap_suit
Feed_each other_wedding cake
Book a little_honeymoon
7_days in Paris
Yeah I'm talking_Tennessee
Ain't_no point in waiting
Baby I'm just saying
We should get_married
Yeah we should (Ooh)
Oh-yeah
We shouldn't even think_about it
We should just do it, we should do it right_now
Let me hear that guitar playin' for me one time
Uh-huh, that sounds good
We could take it nice and slow
We could book a flight, let's go
If you want me to I'll get down on one knee
One, two, three, four wait
We should get_married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little_chapel
Hire_us an_Elvis
Pink_limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking_champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white_dress
I could rent a cheap_suit
Feed_each other_wedding cake
Book a little_honeymoon
7_days in Paris
Yeah I'm talking_Tennessee
Ain't_no point in waiting
Baby I'm just saying
We should get_married
(Ooh) Yeah, baby, we should get_married
Buy a house on a hill we could do everythin' new
(Ooh) Yeah
Ooh, we should get_married
Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on
and this old world
will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had
some time to spend together
There's_no need to watch
the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender
body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me
one_more time
For the good_times
I'll get along you'll_find another
And I'll be here if you should find
you ever need me
Don't say a word about
tomorrow or forever
There'll_be time enough for sadness
when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and
tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you
love me one_more time
For the good_times
Cold cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord can you hear me now
Lord can you hear me now
Lord hear me now
Or am I lost
Love one's daughter
Allow me that
And I can't let go of your hand
Lord can you hear me now
Lord can you hear me now
Lord can you hear me now
Or am I lost
Cold cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord can you hear me now
Lord can you hear me now
Lord can you hear me
Or am I lost
Tall, dark, and Superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder_if he knows how_much that I miss him
I hang on every_word that you say
And you smile and say, "How are you?"
I'll say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you
I love you, I love you forever
I watch_superman fly_away
You've_got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch_superman fly_away
Come_back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right_here on the ground
When you come_back down
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown_eyes has me singing
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they said
And you leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very_first day
I watch_superman fly_away
You've_got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch_superman fly_away
Come_back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right_here on the ground
When you come_back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget_about me
I'm far_away but I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I've loved you from the very_first day
I watch_superman fly_away
You've_got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch_superman fly_away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right_here on the ground
When you come_back down
La, la,_la, la,_la, la
La, la,_la, la,_la, la
When you come_back down
Maybe I didn't treat you Quite
as good as I should have
어쩌면 나 내가 할 수 있는 만큼
당신에게 잘 대해주지 않았는지도 몰라요
Maybe I didn't love you Quite
as often as I could have
어쩌면 나 최선을 다해서
당신을 사랑하지 않았는지도 몰라요
Little things I should have said and done
작은 부분까지 말해주고 해줬어야 했는데
I just never took the time
그러질 못했어요
You were always on my mind
내_맘속엔 언제나_당신이 있었는데
You are always on my mind
내_맘속엔 언제나_당신이 있었는데
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
어쩌면 당신이 정말 외롭고 외로웠을
때 당신을 안아주지도 않았을 거에요
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
당신이 내 사랑이어서
너무 행복하다고 말한 적도 없네요
If I make you feel second best
당신이 뒷전이라는 그런 느낌이 들었다면
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
그대, 정말 미안해요 내가 바보였어요
You were always on my mind
내_맘속엔 언제나_당신이 있었는데
You are always on my mind
내_맘속엔 언제나_당신이 있었는데
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
말해줘요.. 당신의 달콤한 사랑이
사라지지 않았다고 말해줘요
Give me, give me one_more chance
내게 줘요.. 한번만 더 기회를 내게 주세요
To keep you satisfied, satisfied
당신을 만족시킬 수 있는 기회를 줘요
Little things I should have said and done
작은 부분까지 말하고 행동했어야 했는데
I just never took the time
그런 적이 없었어요
You were always on my mind
내_맘속엔 언제나_당신이 있었는데
You are always on my mind
내_맘속엔 언제나_당신이 있었는데

Remember me
to one who_lives there
She once was
a true love of mine
Once_upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
When I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please_tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare_at the phone
and he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me
to the core Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
But I don't anymore
And I stare_at the phone
and he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby
I don't think so
Oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything
Back up baby back up did you
forget everything
'Cause it_rains in your
bedroom everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Oh I stare_at the phone
and he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when we said
forever and always
cause And it_rains in your_bedroom
everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby you said
forever and always
I wanna wake_up
on the beach
no phone or pager
within reach
just us together in the
big blue sea
come_back and lay down
with you next to me
the good life
you and I
and repeat endlessly
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
lets play here all day
lets lay here all day
bask in our paradise
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning_sunshine
I wanna wake_up
next to you
shake off the sand we
rolled into
still little fuzzy from the
night before
skinny dipping and then
wanting_more
the good life you and I
and repeat endlessly
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
lets play here all day
lets lay here all day
bask in our paradise
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning_sunshine
set up a hammock
in between
coconut trees
by a stream
sip on a rum punch
in the shade
and mellow out till
the day fades
then_fall asleep and wake_up
with you again
a rush of pleasure
that just never ends
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
lets play here all day
lets lay here all day
bask in our paradise
morning_sunshine
where have you been
all my life
morning_sunshine
Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've_been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let_them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play_hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your_lips allow
My,_my, my,_my, oh_give me love
My,_my, my,_my, oh_give me love
My,_my, my,_my, oh_give me love
My,_my, my,_my, give me love
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've_been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play_hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your_lips allow
My,_my, my,_my, oh_give me love

Break
Hidden track The Parting Glass
Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've_done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've_done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good_night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one_more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good_night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good_night and joy be with you all
Good_night and joy be with you all
I remember when we broke up the first_time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each_other in a month
When you said you needed "space" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I_love you"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last_night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
We are_never, ever,_ever (ever) getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh_(yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh_(yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh_(yeah)
Oh-oh-oh
I used_to think that we were forever, ever
And I used_to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he_calls me up and he's like, "I still love_you"
And I'm like, "I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting_back together, like, ever"
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
We are_never, ever,_ever (ooh) getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting_back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh,_oh, yeah)
Getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
You're on the phone with your
girlfriend shes upset
Shes going off about
something that you said
Cause she doesn't
get your humor like i do
I'm in my room
it's a typical tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind_of
music she doesn't like
And she'll never
know your story like i do
But she wears short skirts
i wear T shirts
She's cheer_captain and
i'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
when you wake_up
And find what you're
looking_for has been here
the whole time
If you could
see that i'm the one who
understands you
Been_here all along
so why can't you see
You You belong_with me
you belong_with me
Walkin' the streets
with you and your worn_out jeans
I can't_help thinking this is
how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench
thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy
And you've_got a smile that could
light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a
while since she brought you down
You say you're fine
i know you better then that
Hey whatcha doing with a
girl like that
She wears high heels
i wear sneakers
Shes cheer_captain and
i'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
when you wake_up and find
That what you're
looking_for has been here the
whole time If you could
see that i'm the one who
understands you
Been_here all along
so why can't you see
You You belong_with me
Standing by and
waiting at your back door
All this time
how could you not know baby
You belong_with me
you belong_with me
Oh i remember you
drivin' to my house in the
middle_of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
And i know your favorite_songs
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me
Can't you see that i'm
the one who_understands you
Been_here all along
so why can't you see
You belong_with me
Standing by and
waiting at your back door
All this time
how could you not know
Baby you belong_with me
you belong_with me
You belong_with me
Have you ever thought
just maybe you belong_with me
You belong_with me
Hot sand on toes
cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know that memories
Were the best things you ever had
The summer shone
beat down on bony backs
So far_from home
where the ocean stood
Down dust and pine cone tracks
We slept like dogs
down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog all around us
The boom of summer time
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth
rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning
Hot sand on toes
cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know
the friends around you
Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs
or the echoed stone
Careless and young
free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls now
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth
rang true inside these bones
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth
rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning
We grow grow steady as the morning
We grow grow_older still
We grow grow happy as a new dawn
We grow grow_older still
We grow grow steady as the flowers
We grow grow_older still
We grow grow happy as a new dawn
We grow grow_older still
Five weeks in a prison
I made no friends
There's more time to be done
but I've got a week to spend
I didn't pay much attention
first_time around but now
you're hard not to notice
right_here in my town
Where the stage of my old life
meets the cast of the new
Tonights actors me and you
Each day is taking us closer
while drawing the curtains to close
This far or further I need to know
Your increasingly long embraces
are they saying sorry or please
I don't know what's happening
help me
Through the streets on the corners
there's a scent in the air
I ask you out and I lead you
I know my way around here
There's a bench I remember
and on the way there I find
that the movements you're making
are mirrored in mine
And your hand is held open
intentionally or
just what I want to see
Your increasingly long embraces
are they saying sorry or please
I don't know what's
happening help me
I don't normally beg for assistance
I rely_on my own eyes to see
but right_now they make
no sense to me
right_now you make no sense to me
I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but I remember everything
what have I become
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
upon my liar's chair
full_of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone_else
I am still right_here
what have I become
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
if I could start again
a million miles_away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling thru
this world of woe
Yet there's_no sickness
toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark_clouds
will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields
lie just before me
Where God's redeemed
their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my mother
She_said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
So
if you ever want somethin'
and you call call
then I'll come runnin'
to fight
and I'll be at your door
when there's nothin
worth runnin' from
When your_mind's made up
When your_mind's made up
There's_no
point trying to change it
When your_mind's made up
When your_mind's made up
There's_no
point trying to stop it
You see
You're just like everyone
When the shit falls
all you want to do is run
away
and hide all by yourself
when it's far_from
there's_nothing else
When your_mind's made up
When your_mind's made up
There's_no
point trying to change it
When your_mind's made up
When your_mind's made up
There's_no point even talkin
When your_mind's made up
When your_mind's made up
There's_no
point trying to fight it
When your_mind's
your_mind's
Ohhhh
There's_no
point tryin to change it
when your Ohhhh
So
if you ever want something
and you call call
then I'll come runnin
Who_knows how long I've loved you
Do you know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to
I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do
endear you to me
You know I will
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do
endear you to me
You know I will
I will
I can't remember
what I planned tomorrow
I can't remember
when it's time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came_before
I wanted to think
there was endless love
Until I saw the light
dim in your eyes
In the dead of
I found out
Sometimes there's
love that won't survive
New_York City Such
a beautiful_disease
New_York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful_disease
Laura kept all her
disappointments
Locked up in a box
behind her closet door
She pulled the blinds
and listened to the thunder
With no way out
from the family store
We all told her things
could get better
When you just say_goodbye
I'll lay awake one_more night
Caught in a vision
I want to deny
And did I mention
the note that I found
Taped to my locked front_door
It talked about no_regrets
As it slipped from
my hand to the scuffed tile floor
I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the
people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie's lullaby
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beauful disease
We were full_of the stuff
that every dream rested
As if floating
on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattoed conclusion
That the big one
was knocking on the door
What started
as a mass delusion
Would take me far
from the place I adore
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
you are my beautiful
Such a beauful disease
Please look_at me
What do you see
If you ever try to find me
You'll find me
Waiting_for you
'Cause you want me to
Do you know I'll follow blindly
Be kind to me
I'll be the perfect girl
The centre of your world
I hang round your class
Hoping you'll ask me
Anything just to hear you
To be near you
When I catch your eye
You give me a smile
That tell me one day that maybe
Just maybe
I'll be the perfect girl
The centre of your world
I'll be the perfect girl of your
dreams
I'm all that I seem 'cause I
Love you honestly I love you
honestly
I Love you honestly I do
I can't believe you're talking
to me
and I find myself just smiling
Can't stop smiling
Would I like to go with you to a
show
Or just for a walk or something
I'm thinking
I'll be the perfect girl
The centre of your world
I'll be the perfect girl of your
dreams
I'm all that I seem
And I really mean that I
Love you honestly I love you
honestly
I Love you honestly
I Love you honestly I do
I do
I Love you honestly
I Love you honestly
I Love you honestly
I Love you honestly
I Love you honestly
I Love you honestly
I do
I wish the couple on the corner
would just get a room
Seems_like everyone around me is
on their honey moon
I'd love to take a pin to a
heart shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me
Well I don't know how I landed
on this movie set
It's like a casting call for
'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would have noticed if
we'd never met
But everybody's got
somebody but me
And I miss you
without you I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing
we could try it again
I hear loves songs playing on
the radio
And people slow dancing
everywhere I go
Well I'm a good slow dancer but
you'd never know
Cuz everybody's got somebody
but me yeah they do
Everybody's got somebody
And I miss you
cuz without you I don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing
we could try it again
Sitting here lonely at a table
for two
Watching lovers being lovers in
the corner booth
Seems_like even
Cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got someone but me
And I don't know if I'll ever
find another you
But everybody's got
somebody but me
everybody's got somebody
everybody everybody everybody
but me now
everybody's got somebody
everybody but me
everybody's got somebody
i'm miss you
everybody's got somebody
but me
I told you once I'll tell you again
You really are my very best_friend
But I but I had to go to go
Every_time I think of you now
I get so blue somehow
'Cause I 'cause I still love you
love you
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
I can feel the days grow cold
Boy I'd love a hand to hold
Is yours is yours still for me
for me
I know I don't deserve you back
But I'd really like it like that
Would you would you like it too
it too
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
I I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile
on the other end of a phone
In the middle
of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing_along
and gets you thinking_about her
Then the last several miles
turn into a blur yeah
I hope you both feel the sparks
by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one
by the end of the night
I hope you never
ever felt more free
Tell your friends
that you're so happy
I hope she comes_along
and wrecks every one
of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime
to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder
than your wildest dreams
She's everything
you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she_cheats
like you did on me
And then I hope she_cheats
like you did on me
Yeah then I hope she shows up
in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy
and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all
alone waiting by the phone
And then she_calls
And baby I I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
and take her on a first_date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks
by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one
by the end of the night
I hope you never
ever felt more free
Tell your friends
that you're so happy
I hope she comes_along and
wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime
to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder
than your wildest dreams
She's everything
you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she_cheats
like you did on me
And then I hope she_cheats
like you did on me

all the way around

you feel the same way
About her that I feel
about you right_now
I hope you both feel the sparks
by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one
by the end of the night
I hope you never
ever felt more free
Tell your friends
that you're so happy
I hope she comes_along
and wrecks every one
of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime
to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder
than your wildest dreams
She's everything
you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she_cheats
like you did on me
And then I hope she_cheats
like you did on me
Like you did on me
Sitting Down or passing out
Waking up hungover as hell
I phone to say I'm still alive
Or just about it's hard to tell
It's_true, it's true
I do want you oh
It's_true, it's true
I do want you oh
When I'm away_from you
I do want you, do want you
It's_true, it's true
I do want you oh
Your voice it soothes a weary head
While my legs are pulled out bed
Friend puts me on my ass on the floor
Do you recall the night before
Shrug and say I think so
My hands to throb and ache and swell.
Man you let one rip on head
Broke your hand and now you're dead.
It's_true, it's true
I do want you oh
It's_true, it's true
I do want you oh
When I'm away_from you
I do want you, do want you
It's_true, it's true
I do want you oh
Josh he took it pretty well
He was with fault but you'd never tell
Never use my fists in a fight
Only regret I have of that night.
You can marry an architect
Build you a house out on the water
That really impresses your father
And you can find
some grown_up friends
And drink some wine in California
But even if you cut it shorter
You'll always have long blond hair
You'll always be Memphis queen
You'll always be
my first_time in New Orleans
No_matter where I go,
no matter_what I do
I'll never be 23 with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll_never be 23
with anyone but me
We'll always have Folly beach
We'll always have delta nights
We'll always be in-between
real love and real_life
You can ride the train to work
Straighten out your accent in the city
Like your folks ain't from Mississippi
You probably got an office view
Wearing those skirts you always hated
Yeah, you're so sophisticated
But I bet you when you drink too_much
I bet you're thinking 'bout back when
I really hope you're happy now
I'm really glad I knew you then
No_matter where I go,
no matter_what I do
I'll never be 23 with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll_never be 23
with anyone but me
We'll always have Folly beach
We'll always have delta nights
We'll always be in-between
real love and real_life
You'll always have your first last name
Standing in that July rain
Telling me your mind is changed
But in my mind you're still the same
Long blond hair
You'll always be Memphis queen
You'll always be
my first_time in New Orleans
No_matter where I go,
no matter_what I do
I'll never be 23 with anyone but you
You can marry who you want
Go back to Tennessee
But you'll_never be 23
with anyone but me
Nah I couldn't show you 'round
No city outside this town
Ain't much for the cocktail crowd
I've_been there and I got kicked out, huh
I ain't got no stock in Tesla
Just these six strings to impress ya, yeah
There's a whole_lot I don't but
I know what
[Chorus: Seaforth]
I know that a good_beer is a cold one
If you got green, better roll one
And the right drive is a slow one
Down the back road baby I know
That the whole town's for the home team
Bit of hoedown in them old jeans
And I'm damn sure that the day's_done
With a good_beer and a good_beer is a cold one
[Verse 2: Jordan Davis]
And a good_beer taste better on a Friday_night
Feels different under neon lights
Long_as it's been sitting on ice
There_ain't a time that it don't hit right
If you're drinking to forget her
Or drinking to remember, well
There's a whole_lot I don't but
I know what
[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
I know that a good_beer is a cold one
If you got green, better roll one
And the right drive is a slow one
Down the back road baby I know
That the whole town's for the home team
Bit of hoedown in them old jeans
And I'm damn sure that the day's_done
With a good_beer and a good_beer is a cold one
It's a good_beer baby
[Bridge]
If that's Mountain's glowing that I'ma crack it open
[Chorus: Seaforth & Jordan Davis, Both]
'Cause a good_beer is a cold one
If you got green, better roll one
And the right drive is a slow one
Down the back road baby I know
That the whole town's for the home team
Bit of hoedown in them old jeans
And I'm damn sure that the day's_done
With a good_beer and a good_beer is a cold one
If that's Mountain's glowing that I'ma crack it open
The good_beer is a cold one
A good_beer is a cold one
It_feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It_feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's_miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget_about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything_will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything_will be alright if
We just keep_dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two
[Verse_2]
It_seems like one of those_nights
This place is too crowded
Too_many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It_seems like one of those_nights
We_ditch the whole_scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's_miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget_about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything_will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything_will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep_dancing like we're
Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two (Ooh)
[Bridge]
It_feels like one of those_nights
We_ditch the whole_scene
It_feels like one of those_nights
We won't be sleepin'
It_feels like one of those_nights
You look like bad_news
I gotta_have you
I gotta_have you (You)
Woah, ooh, yeah, eh-yeah
[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything_will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything_will be alright if
We just keep_dancing like we're (Dancing like we're twenty-two)
Twenty-two (Woah-oh), twenty-two (Dancing like)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah), twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Outro]
It_feels like one of those_nights (Twenty-two)
We_ditch the whole_scene
It_feels like one of those_nights (Twenty-two)
We won't be sleeping
It_feels like one of those_nights (Twenty-two)
You look like bad_news
I gotta_have you
I gotta_have you
There_is a wind where the rose was
cold rain where sweet grass was
and clouds like sheep
stream o'er the steep
grey skies where the lark was
Nought gold where you hair was
nought warm where your hand was
but phantom forlorn
beneath the thorn
your ghost where your_face was
Sad winds where your voice was
tears tears where my heart was
and ever with me
child ever with me
silence where hope was
There_is a wind where the rose was
There_is a wind where the rose was
The_thrill is gone,
The_thrill is gone away
The_thrill is gone, baby
The_thrill is gone away
You know you've_done me wrong, baby
And you'll be sorry someday
The_thrill is gone
It's gone away_from me
The_thrill is gone, baby
The_thrill has gone away_from me
Although I'm still livin'
But it's a long way out here
The_thrill is gone
Its gone away for good
Oh, The_thrill is gone, baby
Its gone away for good
Some day I know I'll be open armed, baby
Just like I know a man should
You know I'm free free now baby,
I'm free from your spell
Well I'm free free free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over,
Alls I can do is wish you well
Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalee.
Little Jackie_Paper loved that rascal Puff and brought
him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff
Oh, Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalee.
Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalee.
together they would travel on a boat with billowed sails.
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princess would bow when there they came.
Pirate ships would lower their flads when Puff
roared out his name.
Oh, Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalee.
Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalee.
A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giants rings make way for other toys.
One gray night it happened
Jackie_Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.
His head was bent in sorrow.
Grief scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave.
So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave.
Oh, Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalee.
Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalee.
The beauty memories
of all the places
We`ve captured
with our camera
We`ve seen the pyramids
We`ve seen the Louvre
We`ve seen
the Orion upside_down
Total eclipses
and moonlight shadows
We`ve seen dolphins
jumping waves
we`ve ski`ed the mountains
and we swam in the rivers
and let the sunlight
dry our skins
but freedom
freedom never greater
than its owner
freedom is the mastery
of the known
freedom freedom never
greater than its owner
no view is wider than the eye
show a view to someone
who chose to live
his whole_life in cave
he`ll raise his arms
to protect his eyes from learning
and the blindness
to which he belongs
this time it`s me it`s me
cascades of chances
I`ll just let_them be
the unfamiliar is
right below our eyes
don`t look for what we know
the unfamiliar
is right below our eyes
but freedom
freedom never greater
than its owner
freedom is the mastery
of the known
freedom freedom
never greater than its owner
no view is wider than the eye
Lady I'm your knight in shining
armor and I love you
You have made me
what I am and I am_yours
My love there's so_many
ways I want to say I love you
Let me hold you
in my arms forever more
You have gone
and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh we belong together
Won't you believe in my song
Lady for so_many years
I thought_I'd never find you
You have come into my life
and made me whole
Forever let me wake to see
you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper
softly in my ear
In my eyes I see
no_one else but you
There's_no other
love like our love
And yes oh yes
I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long
Lady your love's the only
love I need
And beside me is
where I want you to be
'Cause my love
there's something
I want you to know
You're the love of my life
you're my lady
We used_to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding
Years leave quicker every_time
they come
Remember when we were young
Look back to the best of days
Collecting all yesterdays
As they built up one by one
Oh how we beg and we borrow
Say we do it tomorrow
But tomorrow never seems to come
We used_to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding
Years leave quicker every_time
they come
Remember when we were young
And we were boys on the beach
Everything was in reach
I know it's hard to remember
And all had the years they vanish
I always wanted to learn Spanish
And travel round South-America
We used_to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding
Years leave quicker every_time
they come
Do you remember
when we were young
We used_to never say never
Used to think we live forever
Flying free beneath the sun
Days go running and hiding
The weeks are going
slippy and sliding yeah
Years leave quicker every_time
they come
Do you remember
when we were young
Do you remember
when we were young
Do you remember
when we were young
Do you remember
when we were young
In the dark in the quiet now
It's too_much for me to take
To feel alone as if
there's_no way out
Oh give me piece_of mind today
When the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
In the dark every lights gone out
And there's_nothing left to see
I hear her voice softly calling out
To go the depth and feel the wait
And the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
And the nights are long
And the days go on
And you feel like home
Dancin' in the kitchen
you singing my favorite_songs
Swinging on the front porch
just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are
every reason_why
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown_eyes
all tangled_up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you
Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah they're screamin' my name
This_is what we dreamed about
But out here singin'_about you
baby
all I think_about
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown_eyes
all tangled_up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
Homesick for you
Yeah_yeah
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown_eyes
just tangled_up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
I'm homesick for you
Yeah_yeah
She_broke my heart
she left me all alone
Did it on the phone
'bout 20 seconds long
She_broke my heart
I never saw it comin'
I thought that we were somethin'
she thought we were nothin'
She_broke my heart oh yeah
She called it quits yeah
But lookin' back man
I sure am glad she did
'Cause I wouldn't have been ridin' solo
Friday_night at the House of Blues
And I wouldn't have been there
To accidentally spill my drink on you
You wouldn't have laughеd at
how I dance
I wouldn't have tried to hold your hand
I wouldn't havе thought I had a chance
But here you are
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
She_broke my heart
feel like a million bucks
'Cause if there was still a her
there wouldn't be an us
I could've stayed home
I almost did
But baby look_at
what I would've missed yeah
I wouldn't have been ridin' solo
Friday_night at the House of Blues
And I wouldn't have been there
To accidentally spill my drink on you
You wouldn't have laughed at
how I dance
I wouldn't have tried to hold your hand
I wouldn't have thought I had a chance
But here you are
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
She_broke my heart
And now I know
Why they say oh
God_bless the broken road
'Cause I wouldn't have been ridin' solo
Friday_night at the House of Blues
And I wouldn't have been there
To accidentally spill my drink on you
You wouldn't have laughed at
how I dance
I wouldn't have tried to hold your hand
I wouldn't have thought I had a chance
But here you are (Thank god)
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
Well_thank god_she broke my heart
I probably shouldn't say you make me feel this way
But I can't_help myself when you're around
I took a lethal dose, so now I am a ghost
Floating through the hallways of your house
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing
Sometimes I live in fear that you will disappear
So I pretend I do not care at all
But you call every bluff, do not betray my trust
And catch me as I try my best to fall
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing
So here we are again, we masquerade as friends
Pretending for ourselves and no_one else
'Cause everybody sees we're lying through our teeth
But you're the only medicine that helps
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing
Before we met life was morphine
I couldn't feel, feel a damn thing
If I show up at a party
And see you with somebody
Believe me when I say I'll be fine
I won't drink until I'm dizzy
Or ask you if you miss me
Or hope that you might
take back goodbye
I'm being_honest
Baby I promise
I don't miss you in my bed
I don't hear you in my head
I don't love you I'm not crying
And I swear I'm not lying
Lying_lying lying
Lying_lying I swear I'm not lying
Even_if you don't ask
I'm 'a let you know that
I've_been seeing somebody too
And when she's staring_at me
I swear it makes me happy
Cross my heart
I'm telling the truth
I'm being_honest
Baby I promise
I don't miss you in my bed
I don't hear you in my head
I don't love you I'm not crying
And I swear I'm not lying
Lying_lying lying
Lying_lying I swear I'm not lying
I wake_up in the morning
It's a beautiful_day
Put on another
I'm already over you face
Smile in the mirror
like I ain't going through hell
Keep telling myself
I don't miss you in my bed
I don't hear you in my head
I don't love you
I'm just_tryna keep on tellin' myself
I don't miss you in my bed
I don't hear you in my head
I don't love you I'm not crying
And I swear I'm not lying
Lying_lying lying
Lying_lying lying
Pour me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock_'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt
like this before
Don't wanna think_about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma_need some whiskey_glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out
on the couch right_now
With someone_new
Yeah, I'ma_need some whiskey_glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma_need a double shot
of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through
whiskey_glasses
(Ain't nothing_else to do,
but sip around the truth)
And see the world through
whiskey_glasses
(I need a better view,
where I don't drink to you)
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialling
no more at 3 am
"Mr bartender hittin' me again"
Don't wanna think_about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her

I bet this time of night
you’re still up
I bet_you’re tired
from a long hard week
I bet_you’re sittin'
in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me
And I just wanna tell you
It takes_everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every_time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
I bet you think I either moved
on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out
there’s no reply
I bet it never
ever occurred to you
That I can’t say_hello to you
and risk another goodbye
And I just wanna tell you
It takes_everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every_time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
Oh we made quite a mess babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess babe
In my dreams
you’re touching my face
And asking me
if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just wanna tell you
It takes_everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every_time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
I bet this time of night
you’re still up
I bet_you’re tired
from a long hard week
I bet_you’re sittin'
in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
[Verse_1]
Save your money on the roses, baby
Just leave a daisy on the dashboard
Just pick me up in your old Bronco, baby
Don't gotta ride in on a white_horse
[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you're younger they say it's a kiss in the rain
Throwin' rocks_at a window
[Chorus]
But it's when we're in a crowded_room, put your hand on my back
And waitin' on me in the mornin' with my coffee_black
Back to the basics_'cause they're_bigger than they_seem, yeah
Give me that_typical, simple_love, it's the little things, mm
Yeah, it's the little things (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
It's the little things
[Verse_2]
It's knowin' when you need to pull me closеr
And when you need to give me my spacе
It's wine and vinyl, my head on your shoulder
Don't gotta treat it like a first_date
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Used to think it would be a backseat sex scene
Drawin' hearts on the window, mm, but
[Chorus]
It's when we're a crowded_room, put your hand on my back
And waitin' on me in the mornin' with my coffee_black
Back to the basics_'cause they're_bigger than they_seem, yeah
(Bigger than they_seem, yeah)
Give me that_typical, simple_love, it's the little things, mm, mm-mm
Yeah, it's the little things (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
[Bridge]
Ooh, it ain't grandiose (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Just pull me in and kiss me slow
Ooh, it ain't just for show (It ain't just for show)
Let's not go big, let's just go home
[Chorus]
It's when we're in a crowded_room, put your hand on my back
And waitin' on me in the mornin' with my coffee_black
Back to the basics_'cause they're_bigger than they_seem, yeah
Give me that_typical, simple_love, it's the little things
When I go drinkin' with the girls and you leave on the light
The way you get me laughin' in the middle_of a fight
Back to the basics_'cause they're_bigger than they_seem, yeah
(Bigger than they_seem, yeah)
Give me that_typical, simple_love, it's the little things
Yeah, it's the little (It's the little), the little things
Yeah, it's the little, yeah, it's the little things
Woke up this morning so excited,
Laughed into my coffee couldn’t hide it.
Cos all of these_years that I’ve lived alone,
Finally you and I will build a home.
33 years on this planet,
Don’t think i’ll ever understand it,
If it’s working out better_than I planned it,
Or_maybe i’m coming in for landing.
What shall we do with our time?
Cos we’ll do the rest together,
Oh what shall we do with our lifetime?
Something we can do forever.
Dust in the air from making changes,
Let every clear morning turn the pages.
When I open my eyes and you’re the one I find,
I will be yours and you’ll be mine.
Cos it’s our time, our time,
Oh it’s our time, our time now.
What shall we do with our time?
Cos we’ll do the rest together,
Oh what shall we do with our lifetime?
Something we can do forever.
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone_else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part_of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk_with everyone_else
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone_else
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone_else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part_of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk_with everyone_else
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I just wanna fight like everyone_else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part_of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk_with everyone_else
I'm pretty sure
we almost broke up last_night
I threw my phone across the room
at you
I was expecting
some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning
I said we should talk_about it
'Cause I read you should never
leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in
wearing a football helmet
And said Okay let's talk
And I said
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you
for quite_some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay
Before you
I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems
out on me
But you carry my groceries and now
I'm always laughing
And I love you
because you have given me
No choice but to
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you
for quite_some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay_stay stay_stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
all the time
All those_times that you didn't leave
it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
for my whole_life
Stay and I'll be loving you
for quite_some time
No one_else is gonna love me
when I get mad_mad mad
So I think that it's best
if we_both stay_stay
Stay_stay stay_stay
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you
for quite_some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay_stay
Stay_stay stay_stay
Stay_stay stay
I've_been loving you
for quite_some time time time
You think that it's_funny
when I'm mad_mad mad
But I think that it's best
if we_both stay
ha-ha-ha it's so fun
I remember when we broke up the first_time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each_other in a month
When you said you needed "space" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I_love you"
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last_night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[Chorus]
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
Like, ever
[Verse_2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[Chorus]
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
We are_never, ever,_ever (ever) getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh_(yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh_(yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh_(yeah)
Oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
I used_to think that we were forever, ever
And I used_to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he_calls me up and he's like, "I still love_you"
And I'm like, "I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting_back together, like, ever"
[Chorus]
We are_never, ever,_ever getting_back together
We are_never, ever,_ever (ooh) getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
[Outro]
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting_back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh,_oh, yeah)
Getting_back together
You go talk to your friends,_talk to my friends,_talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are_never, ever,_ever, ever_getting back_together
I took a chance
I took a shot
And you might think
I'm bulletproof but I'm not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground
I see who you are
I'm sick and tired_of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me
then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you
got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover
when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes I remember
what you said last_night
And I know that you see
what you're_doin' to me
Tell me why
Well you could write a book on
How to ruin
someone's perfеct day
Well I get so confused
and frustratеd
Forget what I'm tryin' to say oh
I'm sick and tired
of your reasons
I got no_one to believe in
You tell me that you want me
then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover
when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes I remember
what you said last_night
And I know that you see
what you're_doin' to me
Tell me why
Why do you have
to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to
put down my dreams
So you're the only thing
on my mind
I'm sick and tired_of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me
then cut me down
I'm sick and tired_of your reasons
I've got no_one to believe in
You ask me for my love
then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes I remember
what you said last_night
And I know that you see
what you're_doin' to me
Tell me why Why
Tell me why Oh
I take a step back I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know
You're on the phone with your
girlfriend She's upset
She's going off about
something that you said
She doesnt
get your humour like I do
I'm in the room
its a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind_of
music she doesnt like
And she'll never
know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear t shirts
She's cheer_captain and
I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day
when you'll wake_up and find
That what you're lookin for
has been here the whole time
If you could see that
I'm the one who_understands you
Been_here all along
so why can't you see
You belong_with me
You belong_with me
Walkin the streets with you
in your worn_out jeans
I cant help thinking this is
how it ought to be
Laughing on the park
bench thinkin to myself
Hey isnt this easy
And you've_got a smile
that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in
awhile since she brought you down
You say you find
I know you better_than that
Hey Whatcha doing with a
girl like that
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer_captain and
I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day
when you'll wake_up and find
That what you're
looking_for has been
here the whole time
If you could see that
I'm the one who_understands you
Been_here all along
so why can't you see
You belong_with me
Standin by
waiting at your back door
All this time how
could you not know baby
You belong_with me
You belong_with me
Oh I remember you
driving to my house
in the middle_of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite_songs
and you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that
I'm the one who_understands you
Been_here all along
so why can't you see
You belong_with me
Standing by or waiting at
your back door
All this time how
could you not know baby
You belong_with me
You belong_with me
You belong_with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong_with me
You belong_with me
I don't have time to be in love
kissing you on the cheek
200 times a week
I don't have time to be in love
watching a foreign film
feet on the windowsill
but that's not true when I'm with you
I don't have time to be in love
way too_much candlelight
keeping me warm at night
I don't have time to be in love
cooking a meal for two
climbing all over you
but that's not true when I'm with you
cause I used_to be there for you
when you were so blue
I'd walk with you in the rain
nothing was better
when we did it together
I don't have time for love
I don't have time to be in love
holding you to my chest
feeling your every breath
I don't have time to be in love
laughing so hard we cry
sometimes I don't know why
I don't have time to be in love
maybe this revely
just wasn't_meant for me
but that's not true when I'm with you
when I'm with you
When you're smilin'
when you're smilin'
The_whole world smiles with you
When you're laughin'
oh when youre laughin'
When you're laughin'
oh when youre laughin'
The sun comes shinin' through
But when you're cryin'
you bring on the rain
So stop your sighin
'be happy again
Keep on smilin' Keep on smilin'
Cause when you're smilin'
The_whole world smiles with you
Pa_pa pa ra pa
Pa_pa pa ra pa
But when you're cryin'
you bring on the rain
So stop your sighin
'be happy again
Keep on smilin' Keep on smilin'
Cause when you're smilin'
The_whole world smiles with you
The_whole world smiles with you
Pa_pa pa ra pa
Pa_pa pa ra pa
Keep on smilin' Keep on smilin'
Cause when you're smilin'
The_whole world smiles with you
The_whole world smiles with you
I'm gonna pick_up the pieces
and build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one_thing on my mind it's all for you
And it's dark in a cold_December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's_raging on now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these_things I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things I've_done
I think I love you better now now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
If things go right we can frame
it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've_been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these_things I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things I've_done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more_than I can take
And it's a dark and cold_December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broke I'll mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's_raging on now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these_things I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these_things I've_done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch I'm out of love
I'll_pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these_things I've_done
I will love you better now
My shattered dreams and broken
Heart are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands standing
Close to someone_else
Now I sit all alone
wishing all my feeling was gone
I get my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One_last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you
out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess
I'm down to one last cry
I was here you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun_shines on you
I need some love
to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feelings
were gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One_last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you
out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I know I gotta be strong
But 'round me
Life goes on and on and on
and on
I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I have
my one last cry
One_last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you
out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down
I guess
I'm down to one last cry
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Hey baby
Yeah when I first_saw that bikini
top on her
She's poppin' right out of the
South Georgia water
Thought Oh good lord
she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help_myself
so I walked up and said
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every_little farm town with you
In this brand_new Chevy
with a lift kit
Would look a hell of
a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
She was sippin' on Southern
and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the
sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab
of my truck and said
Fire it up
let's go get this thing stuck
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every_little farm town with you
In this brand_new Chevy
with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better
with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to
its knees
I looked_at her and she looked_at me
And I turned on those KC lights
and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right her and I
man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a_couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat
in my chest bumpin’
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every_little farm town with you
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Down a back road blowin'
stop signs through the middle
Every_little farm town with you
In this brand_new Chevy
with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better
with you up in it Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows
down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww yeah
Ricky played the flute
But she never had a use for it
Miming her part in the school band
While I took a solo
on the saxophone
And I learned harmony
But she could dance
she could move
Like the girls on the TV
Mum took her
to Johnny Young Talent School
But she quit
She_said that she got scared
When they made her do the splits
She tried tap school
and blew the teacher away
But the girls
in the class teased her
Saying she was too chubby
I remember when she told me
She cried in shame
I told her not to worry
We can do_anything
I told her one day
we’d be beautiful
And maybe we could start a band
‘cos I was_born to sing
And she was_born to dance
She was_born to dance like the
Girls_on the TV girls on the TV
She could always dance
better_than the
Girls_on the TV 10am RnB
She could always dance
better_than me
She was bullied all day
And made to feel like a fool
Mum was_born again and decided
To send her
to the Christian school
On Thursdays her friends
Would dance in the spirit
At the school church
but Ricky laughed
And never believed_in it
We moved in with Mum’s first
Boyfriend after Dad
He was only 21
and he’d always get mad
While I hid in my room
Writing poems after school
He tried to kiss Ricky
On the piano stool
I remember when she told me
She was on cocaine
I felt_like I didn’t know her
Or how she got that way
Now her lovers are all married
I wear my wedding_ring
On my right hand
Maybe we weren’t meant
to settle_down
No I was_born to sing
And she was_born to dance like the
Girls_on the TV
Girls_on the TV
She could always dance
better_than the
Girls_on the TV 10am RnB
She could always dance
better_than the
Girls_on the TV
She could always dance
better_than the
Girls_on the TV 10am RnB
She could always dance
better_than the
Girls_on the TV
She could always dance
better_than the
Girls_on the TV
always dance
better_than the
Girls_on the TV
I saw the part_of you
That only when you're older
you will see too
You will see too
I held the better cards
But every stroke of luck
has gotta bleed through
It's gotta bleed through
You held the balance of the time
That only blindly I could read you
But I could read you
It's like you told me
Go forward slowly
It's not a race to the end
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody_else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well you talk like yourself
No I hear someone_else though
Now you're making me nervous
You were the better part
Of every bit of beating
heart that I had
Whatever I had
I finally sat alone
Pitch black flesh and bone
Couldn't believe
that you were gone
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody_else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well you talk like yourself
No I hear someone_else though
Now you're making me nervous
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody_else
Only it ain't on the surface Surface
Well you talk like yourself
No I hear someone_else though
Now you're making me
nervous Nervous
Where are we
Where are we
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody_else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well you talk like yourself
No I hear someone_else though
Now you're making me nervous
Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody_else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well you talk like yourself
No I hear someone_else though
Now you're making me nervous
I saw the part_of you
That only when you're older
you will see to
You will see too
You had dinner at Jude's
and you broke all the plates
Telling your favourite joke
where you break all the plates
You threw all of your clothes
off the back of the boat
You said that you’re gonna
quit but we know that you won't
You won't you won’t
You only like me
when I do my tricks for you
You wear me out like you
wear that southern cross tattoo
You said I'd look much better
if I dropped the attitude
Leave it alone leave it alone
leave it alone leave it alone
You've_got all of your ducks
lined up in a row
Driving back from the job
with Kyle and Jackie-O
You want all of us
to pull you out of the muck
You're always wanting a kiss
and then you want to get laid
Get laid get laid
You only like me
when I do my tricks for you
And you wear me out
like you wear
that southern cross tattoo
You said I'd look much better
if I dropped the attitude
Leave it alone leave it alone
leave it alone leave it alone
You only like me
when I do my tricks for you
And you wear me out like you
wear that southern cross tattoo
I'd look better
if I dropped the attitude
Leave it alone leave it alone
leave it alone leave it alone
Leave it alone leave it alone
leave it alone leave it alone
The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain
under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you
got till you lose it all again
Listen to the mandolin_rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
every_time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
A cool evening dance
Listening to the bluegrass
band takes the chill
From the air till
they play the last song
I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind
but there's moments
That I find I'm not feeling so strong
Listen to the mandolin_rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
every_time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Oh Listen to mandolin_rain
Listen to the mandolin_rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
every_time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Oh Listen to the mandolin_rain
Listen to the mandolin_rain
Listen to the mandolin_rain
Oh Listen to the mandolin_rain
Though they may want you to tread in their trail
Only to see if the path they set fails
Though they may want you to take off your clothes
Whatever they think that the action exposed
With your clothes on the floor
Taking advice from some old balding bore
You'll ask yourself, "Did I want this at all?"
Do you remember what I said?
The book I left by your bed
The words that some survivor read
Lately I've_been thinking_about our daughter growing old
All of the bullshit that she might be told
There's blood on the floor
Maybe now you'll believe her for sure
She remembers what I said
The book I left by her bed
The words that some survivor read
Though they may take you for all you had left
You won't be forgotten for what you had not done yet
So you wished for a kiss from God
And you mourned in your childish loss
Innocence gone but it's not forgot
You'll get your way through it somehow
You remember what I said
The book you left by your bed
The words that will outlive the dead
Yeah you used_to talk_about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer
lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond
on your hand right_now
Maybe a baby or a_couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house
But I wonder
when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking_about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we_both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven_summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger
who knows
Back_then
you used_to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven_summers ago
Ooh_ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin'
same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres
couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things
my way anyway
But I wonder
when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking_about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we_both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven_summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger
who knows
Back_then
you used_to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven_summers ago
Ooh
Seven summers_ago
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Seven summers_ago
Ooh_ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah I wonder
when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking_about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we_both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven_summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger
who knows
Back_then
you used_to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven_summers ago
Ooh
Seven summers_ago
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Seven summers_ago
Ooh_ooh-ooh
Mr. Perfect face
Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye
and told me
you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've_been waitin' for you
all my life
Mr. Every_single day
until the end
I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know
Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone
I fall_apart
It takes_everything in me
just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see
that you're okay
Hello_Mr. Perfectly_fine
How's your heart
after breaking mine
Mr._Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Hello_Mr. Casually_cruel
Mr._Everything revolves
around you
I've_been Miss_Misery
since your goodbye
And you're Mr._Perfectly fine
Mr. Never told me why
Mr. Never had to see me cry
Mr. Insincere apology
so he doesn't look
like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well I thought you might be
different than the rest
I guess you're all the same
'Cause I hear he's got his arm
'round a brand-new girl
I've_been pickin' up my heart
he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past
what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see
that it never fazed you
Hello_Mr. Perfectly_fine
How's your heart
after breakin' mine
Mr._Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Hello_Mr. Casually_cruel
Mr._Everything revolves
around you
I've_been Miss_Misery
since your goodbye
And you're Mr._Perfectly fine
So dignified in your
well-pressed suit
So strategized
all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat
in the best room
Oh he's so smug
Mr._Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss
Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then
you'll be Mr. Too late
Goodbye Mr._Perfectly fine
How's your heart
after breakin' mine
Mr._Always at the right place
at the right time baby
Goodbye Mr._Casually cruel
Mr._Everything revolves
around you
I've_been Miss_Misery
for the last time
And you're Mr._Perfectly fine
You're perfectly fine
Mr. Look me
in the eye and told me
you would never go away
You said you'd never go away
I'm tryna blow bubbles but inside
Can't seem to fix my mood
Today it's as dark as my roots
If I if I ever let_them grow out Ah-ah
Now all of my oceans have riptides
Can't seem to find what's wrong
The_whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s
seem so far_away
Ay-ay-ay-ay
Ladies begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations
Love and light
You can burn sage
and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high
but only if the wind_blows
Blows just right
I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away floating away
I'm tryna get well from the inside
Plants and celebrity news
all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewherе eastern
they'll havе what I need
They'll have what I need
Let's go
Ladies begin your sun salutations
Pluto in Scorpio generation
Love and light
You can burn sage
and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high
but only if the wind_blows
Blows just right ri-ri-ri-right
I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep_dancing
'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away floating away
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place
Anywhere
Watch the sun set
look back on my life
Take me to some kinda
I just wanna know
will it be alright
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place
Anywhere
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that Baby I'm right_here smile
And it would've felt_like
A_million little shining stars
had just aligned
And I would've_been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting_for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've_been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red_lipstick
With no_one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But thеre was one_thing missing
And that was the momеnt I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends
always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall_apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said he'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red_lipstick
With no_one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one_thing missing
Missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming
down your_face
In front_of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means
the most to you
Is the one who didn't show
You should've been here
And I would've_been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red_lipstick
With no_one to impress
And they're all standing around me
singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one_thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You called me later
And said I'm sorry I didn't make it
And I said I'm sorry too
And that was the moment I knew
Baby, standing here with you
With your arms_around my shoulders
We're dancing with the moon
And baby, it feels just like a dream
When I whisper that I love you
And you say it back to me
I got you
For the rest_of my days
In the sun on Sunday_morning
Or the pouring_rain
I got you
For the rest_of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright
Cuz I got you
You and only you
You and only you
Baby, lookin' in your eyes
It's like we're in slow motion
Just you and me tonight
Then baby, you lean for a kiss
And I know and I know and I know that it don't get better_than this
I've got forever
And I've got all I'll ever need
She likes staying up 'til 3
Reading books of fantasy
Getting lost in other worlds
Only she can see
She likes singing paramore
Playing drums on my dashboard
Every note she hits with ease
I'll listen forevermore
It's been a long long day near sunset
and my minds racing baby i'm just wondering
Do I remind you of any characters
You've_been dreaming of while the pages turn
Do I even stand a chance
Do I even make the cut
Am I the good guy
Do I make to the last chapter
She_loves breaking up the ice
Same_old joke told once or twice
Only lands a_couple laughs
But it gets her every_time
She_loves london in the fall
Hyde Park with alcohol
Just leaving for a week
Makes it worth it all
It's been a long long day near sunset
and my minds racing baby I'm just wondering
Do I remind you of any characters
You've_been dreaming of while the pages turn
Do I even stand a chance
Do I even make the cut
Am I the good guy
Do I make to the last chapter
It's been a long long day near sunset
and my minds racing baby I'm just wondering
Do I remind you of any characters
You've_been dreaming of while the pages turn
Do I even stand a chance
Do I even make the cut
Am I the good guy
Do I remind you of any characters
You've_been dreaming of while the pages turn
Do I even stand a chance
Do I even make the cut
Am I the good guy
Do I make to the last chapter
Put your sweet lips a little_closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you,
he'll have to go
Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Though love is blind, make up your mind,
I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him,
he'll have to go?
You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you want me? Answer yes or no
Darling, I will understand
Put your sweet lips a little_closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you
He'll have to go
Now I've heard
there was a secret chord
That David played
and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really
care for music do you
It goes like this
The fourth the fifth
The minor fall the major lift
The baffled king
composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Your faith was strong
but you needed proof
You saw her bathing
on the roof
Her beauty and the
moonlight overthrew her
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She_broke your throne
and she cut your hair
And from your_lips
she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did well really
what's it to you
There's a blaze of light
In every_word
It_doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth
I didn't come to fool you
And even_though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue
but Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah_Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've_looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and THEY snow on everyone
So_many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've_looked at clouds from both_sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way THAT you feel
As every fairy_tale comes real
I've_looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let_them know
Don't give yourself away
I've_looked at love from both_sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I_love you" right out_loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've_looked at life that way
Oh but now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day
I've_looked at life from both_sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
Are you going to
Scarborough_Fair
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Remember me
to one who_lives there
She once was
a true love of mine
Tell_her to make me
a cambric shirt
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Without no seams
nor needless work
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell_her to find me
an acre of land
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Between the salt water
and the sea strand
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell_her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
And gather it all
in a bunch of heather
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Are you going to
Scarborough_Fair
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Remember me
to one who_lives there
She once was
a true love of mine
To the queen of hearts he's the ace of sorrow
He's here today, he's gone tomorrow
Young men are plenty but sweethearts few
If my love leave me what shall I do?
Had I the store in yonder mountain
Where gold and silver is there for counting
I could not count for thought of thee
My eyes so full I could not see
My_father left me both house and land
And servants many at my command
At my commandment they ne'er shall be
I'll forsake them all and go with thee
I love my father, I love my mother
I love my sister, I love my brother
I love my friends and relations too
I'll leave them all and go with you
To the queen of hearts he's the ace of sorrow
He's here today, he's gone tomorrow
Young men are plenty but sweethearts few
if my love leaves me what shall I do?
The telegraph gave us hope
Before was the silence
and the panic it brought
The sky was the blankest sheet
We drew lines upon it
so our thoughts could meet
through cables black and cold
we carry our intentions to bridge
and bring home
would it all be so clear
if the lines were erased
and the silence restored
Boys of today write lines on walls
in the streets at night
in suburbans of cities with no name
is this destruction
or just quiet protest
against loneliness
the car go lights in our lamps
they`re weight is so heavy
and this is all we know
our message will need a ship
to travel across oceans
that can`t otherwise be crossed
it underplate on the waves
and cautions the water
so we can be safe
it underplate on the waves
then cautions the water
so we can be safe
I used_to think one day
we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks
flew instantly
And people would say
they're the lucky ones
I used_to know my place
was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room
for an_empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know
what page you're on
Oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fall out
So_many things
that I wish you knew
So_many walls up
I can't break through
Now I'm standing_alone
in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's_killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
when it all broke_down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy_now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling
at my clothes and trying
to look busy
And you're_doing your
best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day
I'll tell the story of us
how I was losing my mind
when I saw you here
But you held your pride like
you should've held me
Oh I'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending
this is nothing
I'd tell you I miss you
but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite
this loud
Now I'm standing_alone
in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's_killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
when it all broke_down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy_now
This_is looking like a contest
Of who can act_like they careless
But I liked it better
when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather
love than fight
So_many things that you
wish I knew but the story of us
might be ending soon
Now I'm standing_alone
in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's_killing me yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
when it all broke_down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy NOW NOW NOW YEAH
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's_killing me yeah
And I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
cause we're_going down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy_now
the end
You got a vibe so hot
You're really really turning me on
Swimmin in your parking lot
I'm singing in a camp on your lawn
And everyday without you
is just a waste of time
You're the first thing on my mind
when I wake_up
You're the last thing that I think of
when I go to sleep
I'm throwing yo
my love so pick it up
And you can have me
anytime you want
You can have me really
anytime you want
You can have me
anytime you want
You can have me really
anytime you want
I want you now
I want you right_now
I want you right_now
I want you right_now
I wanna hook you up
Boy I'm gonna set you on fire
I wanna turn your volume up
And listen to you all day long
Now every other station's
just a memory
I change you
when your name broke off the dial
Is it funny_how you
just keep running into me
I've_been listening to
your music for a while
And you can have me
anytime you want
You can have me really
anytime you want
You can have me
anytime you want
You can have me
really anytime you want
I want you now
I want you right_now
I want you right_now
I want you right_now
You're always such a fool
And in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
Do you remember when
We used_to live things separate
We hadn't met or thought
That could be possible
I'm glad you had your life
So good to listen to your past
All of those things brought you
With me and now we're two
You're always such a fool
And in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
And in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before
But if I try to think
Of something better_than this
Heaven comes down
And reminds the luck we live
You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice so true
I hear the dream
I never had before
It_was our first_week
At Myrtle Beach
Where it all began
It_was 102
Nothin' to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in
We were summertime
sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your_lips
T shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget
Watchin' that blonde_hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every_wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It_was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
We had our first dance in the sand
It_was one hell of a a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right_here
'Til the sun starts
creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were
thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked_at you
Watchin' that blonde_hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every_wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It_was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
you and me
Watchin' that blonde_hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Watchin' that blonde_hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every_wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It_was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
First week in myrtle beach
where it all began
I don't know if you were
looking at me or not
You probably smile
like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cause everybody
in here knows your name
And you're not looking_for
anything right_now
So I don't wanna come on strong
don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing
you know you're trying to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends
is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed
to save you from random guys
That talk too_much
and wanna stay too long
It's the same_old song and dance but
I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
Every_time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more_than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how_much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close
to anyone
or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams
I don't know how you do
what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps_getting better
I want to spend the rest
of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every_little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you
The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh it feels_like the first_time
every_time
I want to spend the whole night
in your eyes
I don't know how you do
what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps_getting better
I want to spend the rest
of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every_little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you
Every_little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps_getting better
I wanna spend the rest_of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every_little thing that you do
Every_little thing that you do
Every_little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you
I don't want to hurt you
I just want to hold you
But I know I don't deserve you
And that's something that I can't do
I know you and you know me
Oh, I can't seem to let you be
I can't hold this down, I can't hold this down
So love me with the lights out
All we have is right_now
Baby hold me close and don't let go
'Cause this is bound to end
Maybe we can make believe
Tell ourselves we don't see
What this is and what it's not
Help me to forget
Just love me with the lights out
Oh, love me with the lights out
You're the one who called me
Late last_night and told me
That you think you deserve me
That I'm something you need
But we_both know the truth
No, I'm not the one for you
I can't hold this down, I can't hold this down
So love me with the lights out
All we have is right_now
Baby hold me close and don't let go
'Cause this is bound to end
Maybe we can make believe
Tell ourselves we don't see
What this is and what it's not
Help me to forget
Just love me with the lights out
Oh, love me with the lights out
Just love me with the lights out
Oh, love me with the lights out
I don't want to hurt you
I just want to hold you
I just want to hold you.
Sometimes
you get what you've
always been wishing for
And most times
it's not on your deadline
But that's alright
I was worn_out and jaded
from trying on people to love
But you fit so well
When they ask why
I can never explain
But a symphony played
when you told me your name
And I took that as a sign
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be mine
Mmm Hmm
Sometimes it's hard to see
what the future holds
And most times
it feels_like a steep climb
And that's alright
There's magic in details
the tender small gestures of love
And the way they all add up
When they ask why
I can never explain
But a symphony played
when you told me your name
And it sounded like a sign
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be my
beginning my middle my end
Will you be mine
Five years_later
and I'm still yours
Ten years_later
and I'm still yours
Fifty years_later
and I'm still your
beginning and middle and end
Five years_later
and I'm still yours
Ten years_later
and I'm still yours
Fifty years_later
and I'm still your
beginning and middle and end
beginning and middle and end
Oh
Will you be my beginning
my middle my end
Will you be my beginning
my middle my end
Will you be my beginning
my middle my end
Will you be mine
Morning_has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has_spoken like the first bird
Praise_for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise_for them springing fresh from the world
Sweet the rains new fall, sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dewfall on the first grass
Praise_for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass
Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the one light, Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day
Morning_has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has_spoken like the first bird
Praise_for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise_for them springing fresh from the world
Come a little_bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleepin'
We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon risin'
Let's go dancin' in the light
We know where the music's playin'
Let's go out and feel the night
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's gettin' late
And the moon is climbin' high
I want to celebrate
See it shinin' in your eye
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right_now
And all I can taste is this_moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels_like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I collect your red flags and tie them to my chest
They're my new favorite dress
And I'm not one to brag
But I think I might pass your impossible test
I've_been studying hard
Decoding equations of contradictory texts
And I think that I like
That I'm never quite sure
Who I'll be to you next
[Chorus]
You're a sunbeam
Through a brick wall
You're an_empty glass on my bedside table
And I can't sleep
I'm too thirsty
But I'll refill you just as soon_as I'm able
[Verse_2]
Our words dance in circles of meaningless hope
Til the music stops and I choke
You ask what do I mean
I just wanna get clean
And rewrite all the words that we spoke
These feelings are knives carving into our_lives
But we blame it on the moon
But don't worry it's early enough in the game
We'll be over soon
[Chorus]
You're a sunbeam
Through a brick wall
You're an_empty glass by my bedside table
And I can't sleep
I'm too thirsty
But I'll refill you
But only if you ask me to
[Verse_3]
I've_been stuck in a drought
Thought you'd be my way out
But I'm parched after talking to you
I'm parched after talking to you
We drove all the way to Samalaman Bay
Never heard of the place 'til we got there
And the sand was so white
And the trees were so green
And the sea so blue
It made me think of you
[Chorus]
’Cause if I didn't have you to come home to
I'd probably find it hard to leave
But I do,_oh I do,_oh I do
I have you
[Verse_2]
We drove all the way to Samalaman bay
Where at the end of the day the sun’s still shining
We sat on the beach with the world out of reach
'Til wе saw the moon, it made me think of you
[Chorus]
'Causе if I didn't have you to come_back to
I'd probably find it hard to leave
But I do,_oh I do,_oh I do
I have you
Oh, if I didn't have you to come_back to, if I didn't have you
But I do,_oh I do,_oh I do
I have you
[Bridge]
'Cause love is brighter than that starry sky
Yet still I see you there and don’t know why
Maybe it illuminates my eyes to you
It illuminates my eyes to the beauty of you
The beauty of you
[Chorus]
If I didn’t have you to come_back to
If I didn't have you
But I do,_oh I do,_oh I do
Oh I do,_oh I do,_oh I do
Oh I do,_oh I do,_oh I do
Oh I do,_oh I do,_oh I do
I have you
Once_upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were_trouble when you walked in
So,_shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were_trouble when you walked in
So,_shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble,_trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble,_trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason_why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
I knew you were_trouble when you walked in (oh)
So,_shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were_trouble when you walked in
So,_shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble,_trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble,_trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!
I knew you were_trouble when you walked in
So,_shame on me now
Flew me to places_I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were_trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there)
So,_shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places_I'd never been (ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble,_trouble, trouble (oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble,_trouble, trouble
I knew you were_trouble when you walked in
Trouble,_trouble, trouble
I knew you were_trouble when you walked in
Trouble,_trouble, trouble
I like the way
you sound in the morning
We're on the phone
and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk you didn't notice
I hear the words
but all I can think is
We should be together
Every_time you smile I smile
And every_time you shine
I'll shine for you
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump_then fall
Jump_then fall_into me
Baby I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump_then fall
Well I like the way
your hair falls in your_face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your_face oh
I've never been so wrapped up
honey
I like the way you're everything
I ever wanted
I had time to think it o over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep_breath and
jump_then fall_into me
'Cause every_time you smile I smile
And every_time you shine
I'll shine for you
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump_then fall
Jump_then fall_into me
Baby I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump_then fall
The bottom's gonna drop out
from under our feet
I'll catch you I'll catch you
When people say things
that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come
when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you
through the night until you smile
Whoa oh I need you baby
Don't be afraid please
Jump_then fall
Jump_then fall_into me
Baby I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump_then fall
Jump_then fall baby
Jump_then fall_into me into me
Every_time you smile I smile
And every_time you shine I shine
And every_time you're here
Baby I'll show you I'll show you
You can jump_then fall
jump_then fall
Jump_then fall_into me
into me yeah
Verse_1
This_is the first day of my life
I swear I was_born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain suddenly, everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don’t know where I am
I don’t know where I’ve_been
But I know where I want to go
Chorus
And so, I thought I’d let you know
That these_things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Mhm mhm
Verse_2
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke_up
And you said “This is the first day of my life
I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now, I don’t care I could go_anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”
Chorus
So if you wanna be with me
With these things, there’s no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I’d rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Aha mmm
Besides, maybe this time is different
I mean, I really think you like me
Me-eee
Me-eeeee
Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right_here waiting_for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart_breaks
I will be right_here waiting_for you
I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've_got me going crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right_here waiting_for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart_breaks
I will be right_here waiting_for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've_got me going crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right_here waiting_for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart_breaks
I will be right_here waiting_for you
Waiting_for you
Sun_comin' up on a dream come around
One_hundred years from the empire now
Sun_comin' up on a world that's easy now

One_hundred years from the empire now
Sun_comin' up on a world that's easy now
One_hundred years from, one hundred_years from
After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
The way that things are turnin'
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'
Sun_comin' up on a dream come around
One_hundred years from thе empire now
Sun_comin' up on a world that's easy now
Onе hundred_years from, one hundred_years from
The martyrs of our revolution
Their spinnin' caused the earth to shake
The problem brought its own solution
They power now the world we've made
After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
For all the gold or sterling
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'
Sun_comin' up on a dream come around
One_hundred years from the empire now
Sun_comin' up on a world that's easy now
One_hundred years from, one hundred_years from
I do swear
that I'll always be there.
I'd give anything and everything
and I will always care.
Through weakness and strength,
happiness and sorrow,
for better or worse,
I will love you
with every beat of my heart.
From this_moment life has begun
From this_moment you are the one

can't_wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this_moment as long_as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There_is nothing I wouldn't give
From this_moment on
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer
to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you
From this_moment as long_as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There_is nothing I wouldn't give
From this_moment
I will love you as long_as I live
From this_moment on
I am just a poor boy
Though my story
is seldom told
I have squandered
my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
all lies and jest Still
a man hears
what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest Mm mm
When I left my home
and my family
I was no more_than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of
a railway station
Running scared
laying low Seeking out
the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking_for the places
only they would know
Lie_la lie
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking_for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come on from the
whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were
times when I was so_lonesome
I took some comfort
there Ooo la_la
Lie_la lie
Then I'm laying out
my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
going home
Where the New_York City
winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that
laid him down
Or cut him till_he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving
But the fighter
still_remains
Lie_la lie
Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose let it fall
Layin' soft up on my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning_light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't_care who's right or wrong
And i won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
Lord it's bad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
Standing at the crossroads
trying to read the signs
To tell me which way
I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant_your love and let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely let it grow
Looking_for a reason
to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend
that I can count on
But there's_nothing
left to show
Plant_your love and let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
let it grow
Time is getting shorter
and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get
what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant_your love and let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
He was_born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin¡？ home to a place he¡？d never been before
He left yesterday behind him,
you might say he was_born again
You might say he found a key for every door
When he first came to the mountains
his life was far_away
On the road and hangin¡？ by a song
But the string¡？s already broken
and he doesn¡？t really care
It keeps changin¡？ fast and it don¡？t last for long
But the Colorado_Rocky Mountain_high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky_Mountain high_(high Colorado)
Rocky_Mountain high_(high Colorado)
He climbed cathedral mountains,
he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once,
and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests
and the streams
Seeking grace in every_step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
And the Colorado_Rocky Mountain_high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky_Mountain high_(high Colorado)
Rocky_Mountain high_(high Colorado)
Now his life is full_of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains
down to bring in a_couple more
More people, more scars upon the land
And the Colorado_Rocky Mountain_high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
I know he¡？d be a poorer man
if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky_Mountain high
It¡？s a Colorado_Rocky Mountain_high
I¡？ve seen it rainin¡？ fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody¡？s high
Rocky_Mountain high_(high Colorado)
Rocky_Mountain high_(high Colorado)
Rocky_Mountain high_(high Colorado)
Rocky_Mountain high do de do
Oh at night when I sleep
Oh the dreams come to me
Make me believe that
my life is not my own
And if life were like my dreams
All the things I would see
I'd be so_much braver than I know
mmmmm
No I can't understand
What it means to be a man
And to lead a woman from her home
And if love were indeed
All the things I believe
Then I guess
I would never feel alone
mmmmm
oh will I ever know
And if this city never sleeps
Does that mean that noone dreams
And if that's so
Then I guess I'm going home
Mmm
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or_two
I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl
in your own little world
And me in it
You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah you're my kind_of different
And I never seen nothin'
Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing in the rain no music
Just the right kind_of crazy baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t_shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't_nobody ever seen
nothin' like you
When you're wearing them
worn_out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing
my heart like a gypsy
I love the way that you kiss me
In front_of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothin'
Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing in the rain no music
Just the right kind_of crazy baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t_shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't_nobody ever seen
nothin' like you yeah
Nothin' like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing in the rain no music
Nothin' like you

But you just doing your thing

nothin' like you yeah
Never seen
never seen nothin' like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Mmm
Never seen nothin' like you
I don't need it
I don't need it anyway
If I can't_pack it in a suitcase
If I can't fit it in a suitcase
If I can't take it down the highway
Maybe I don't really need it anyway, yeah
And if I can't look into your green eyes
Kiss you once or maybe baby two times
Then we haven't been if it ain't right
So baby let's get away
And make our escape
Really what else do we need
If the sky and the stars come free, yeah
I'm feeling rich off your million dollar kiss
If it ain't you baby they can have it
I don't want it if I can't_pack it in a suitcase
I don't need, I don't need it anyway
If I can't_pack it in a suitcase
I don't need, I don't need it anyway
If I can't_pack it in a suitcase
If you don't sing it and it don't rhyme
If you ain't in the sun and it don't shine
Girl I don't want to know me if you ain't mine
Baby tell me why
All this stuff but still got no time
I've had enough living this concrete lie
So let's get away
And make our escape
Really what else do we need
If the sky and stars come free
I'm feeling rich off your million dollar kiss
But if it ain't you they can have it
I don't want it if I can't_pack it in a suitcase
I don't need, I don't need it anyway
I don't need, I don't need it anyway
Baby tell me why
We got all this stuff but still no time
I've had enough living this concrete lie
So let's get away
And make our escape
Really what else do we need

I'm feeling rich off your amillion dollar kiss
But if it ain't you they can have it

I don't need, I don't need it anyway
If I can't_pack it in a suitcase
I don't need anyway
If it ain't you baby I don't need it anyway
It's just you and me baby and a dream to chase
We can bring it we don't need it anyway
If we can't, we can't, we can't fit it in a suitcase
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and_thyme
Remember me to one who_lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell_her to make me a cambric shirt
On the side of a hill,
in the deep forest green
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and_thyme
Tracing of sparrow on
snow-crested ground
Without no seams nor needle work
Blankets and bedclothes
the child of the mountain
Then_she'll be a true love of mine
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
Tell_her to find me an acre of land
On the side of a hill,
a sprinkling of leaves
Parsley, sage, rosemary and_thyme
Washes the grave with silvery tears
Between the salt water
and the sea strands
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Then_she'll be a true love of mine
Tell_her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
War bellows blazing in
scarlet battalions
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and_thyme
Generals order their soldiers to kill
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And to fight for a cause
they've long_ago forgotten
Then_she'll be a true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and_thyme
Remember me to one who_lives there
She once was a true love of mine
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely_weekend
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
[Verse_1]
Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, then Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's_goin' on, only got a_couple friends
[Chorus]
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely_weekend (So lonely)
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah
[Verse_2]
I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun
I keep lookin'_at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part_of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and
[Chorus]
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely_weekend (So lonely)
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah
[Bridge]
Even_if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes, sometimes
[Chorus]
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely_weekend (So lonely)
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely_weekend
It's a_lo-, it's a_lo-, it's a lonely_weekend
Theres more to life than happiness
More will never know
When you're heart is filled
with emptiness
Making a mess of your soul
When you're down and feeling low
wanting to give up give up give up
Just hold your head head_high
Oh_oh weve been lost here
once or twice
In this pitch black room
without a light
Even_if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head head_high
Just hold your head head_high
There's more to love than
wanting love
More_than we could show
Maybe its as simple as knowing
when to let go
When you're down and feeling low
don't give up give up give up
Just hold your head head_high
Oh_oh we've_been lost here
once or twice
In this pitch black room
without a light
Even_if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head head_high
Just hold your head head_high
Just hold your head head_high
Hold your head head_high
hold your head
Hold your head head_high
ooh lord
Hold your head head_high
Ooooh we've_been lost here
once or twice
In this pitch black room
without a light
Even_if we fall we'll survive
Just hold your head head_high
Just hold your head head_high
Can't_get no where
which' yo head down
can't get no where
Can't_get no where
which' yo head down
with your head down
Can't_get no where
which' yo head down
Can't_get no where
which' yo head down
Can't_get no where
which' yo head down
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Keep your head up
Somewhere in Germany,
but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part_of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back I'll lay around
And I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's_no place like my room
But you had to go
I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and
melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go
I know, I know, I know
Out in the park, we watch the sunset
Talking on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet
And I got mean
Always pushing you away_from me
But you come_back with gravity
And when I call, you come home
A bird in your teeth
So I gotta go
I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down
with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it
I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now
I know, I know, I know
Driving out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking_for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair_of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America First rap country_song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolts of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said "The End Is Near"
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is... ahh!
I have a memory
Of a time and place
where history resigned
Now my apology
All the light came in
to fulminate my mind
Reach out reach out
To all the ones
who came_before you
Ponder what is right
You and I in defiance
Speak out speak out
The conversation may afford you
Wisdom of the wise
You and I in defiance
And I come from conscience
where there is no conjugation
I would rather be a flower
than the ocean
And I held myself as something
of an innovation
I would rather be devoured
than be broken
All my life I tried so hard
To separate myself from all
That is and was and will be torn apart
You were running unafraid
I know you but I've changed my way
You know I take it all to heart
Home is where you've called my name
I've gone as far as the eye can blame
You said love may have lost its way
Now my life has been erased
And what I gave I gave for you
And for myself and for the holy name
You were running unashamed
And yours is mine and all remains
As nothing ever stays the same
Reach out reach out to
all the ones who came_before
Reach out reach out to
all the ones who came_before
Reach out reach out and
all at once the pain restores you
Reach out reach out and
all at once the pain restores you
All at once the pain restores you
I have a memory of a time and
place where history resigned
Now in my reverie
For the guiding light
that opened up my mind
Don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that Ah-Ah
Don’t look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do
what's upstanding and right
It’s kinda like a code yeah
And you've_been
getting closer and closer
And crossing so_many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no one's exception
This I have previously learned
So don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that Ah-Ah
Don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got mе alone
And I say Don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And еverybody knows that
Everybody_knows that
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind_of man
who makes me sad
While she waits up
you chase down the newest thing
And take for_granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her
So don’t look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that Ah-Ah
Don’t look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got me alone
And I say Don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that
Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh
Call a cab
Lose my number
You’re about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned
Don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that Ah-Ah
Don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that
I wanna see you pick_up your phone
And tell her you’re coming_home
Don't look_at me
You got a girl at home
And everybody_knows that
Everybody_knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I haven't once been just like her
We’ve been swinging and missin’
It ain’t broke yet
But damn it needs fixin’
Been awhile since your kiss
felt_like kissing
It’s just different
We’ve been talking bout forever
Since we’ve been together
Something bout a ring
Makes you think we’re better off with
All this
But we’re caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your_face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place
For the record, shit
Throwing in the towel
takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out
for better weather
Together
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your_face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place
We’ve been talking bout forever
Since we’ve been together
Something bout a ring
That makes you think
we’re better off with
All this
But we’re caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Tears rolling down your_face
As I walked out the door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
How much more of this can we take
Verse_1
You picked your chair to sit in
You made the bed in which you lay
I used_to tuck you in it
You let your dreams take you away
The clock was always tickin'
I fought it off and stayed awake
But now these nights look different
The colors dyed another way
Pre-Chorus
So you asked me
What would I do
If just for a minute I was you
Chorus
I took every_step
In your heart and in your head
I see what you see
But nothing looks right
You brought me somewhere I'd never be
Verse_2
You carved out your decision
Before you took the turn from me
The life we almost livеd in
The mornings walking Turnham Green
Pre-Chorus
So you asked me
What would I do
If just for a minutе I was you
Chorus
I took every_step
In your heart and in your head
I see what you see
But nothing looks right
You brought me somewhere I'd never be
Chorus
I took every_step
In your heart and in your head
I see what you see
But nothing looks right
You brought me somewhere I'd never be
The moon is letting_go
Of everything I know tonight
The hours turn to days
The sky is out of phase
Are we alright?
[Pre-Chorus]
Overcrowded ghost_town
Sun behind a dark cloud
All my favourite spots have closed down
Nowhere to go now
[Chorus]
Strange_weather
Strange_weather
[Verse_2]
It_seems like yesterday
I could simply drift away_from all this
Now I'm not so sure
About anything anymore
If I'm honest
[Pre-Chorus]
Am I out of my mind?
Is it a matter of time?
[Chorus]
Strange_weather
Strange_weather
Oh, strange weather
Is it gonna go on and on forever?
[Bridge]
Overcrowded ghost_town
The sun peaks through the dark cloud
All my favourite spots have closed down
We've nowhere to go now
[Chorus]
Strange_weather
Strange_weather
Oh, strange weather
Is it gonna go on and on forever?
[Outro]
Strange_weather
Strange_weather
Strange_weather
I went lookin'_at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a_couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours
[Chorus]
And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman_who believed_in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman_who was there for me
Religiously
[Verse_2]
Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought_I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'
[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman_who believed_in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' hard just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman_who was there for me
Religiously
[Bridge]
You brought me to God and I put you through hell
You were all about us, I was all about myself
What kind_of man would lose a woman like that?
If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back
[Chorus]
Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman_who believed_in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Beggin' God just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman_who believed_in me
Religiously
[Outro]
I ain't got the only woman_who was there for me
Religiously
Yeah I know that we just met
So pardon my drunk confidence
And I know you don’t know me yet
But my heart skipped 10 steps ahead
Yeah you can call me crazy
But I think maybe
We should start forever right_now
We should get_married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little_chapel
Hire_us an_Elvis
Pink_limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking_champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white_dress
I could rent a cheap_suit
Feed_each other_wedding cake
Book a little_honeymoon
7_days in Paris
Yeah I’m talking_Tennessee
Ain’t no point in waiting
Baby I’m just saying
We should get_married
We could stay_here for one_more drink
Or we could double down on some pawn shop rings
Give a heads up to your mom and dad
Or we could let ‘em know when we get back
I hear them church_bells ringing
The choir singing
See you walking down the aisle
We should get_married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little_chapel
Hire_us an_Elvis
Pink_limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking_champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white_dress
I could rent a cheap_suit
Feed_each other_wedding cake
Book a little_honeymoon
7_days in Paris
Yeah I’m talking_Tennessee
Ain’t no point in waiting
Baby I’m just saying
We should get_married
We could take it nice and slow
We could book a flight, let’s go
If you want me to I’ll get down on one knee
We should get_married
Take it out to Vegas
Find a little_chapel
Hire_us an_Elvis
Pink_limousine longhorns on the hood
Drinking_champagne out the sunroof we could
Get you in a white_dress
I could rent a cheap_suit
Feed_each other_wedding cake
Book a little_honeymoon
7_days in Paris
Yeah I’m talking_Tennessee
Ain’t no point in waiting
Baby I’m just saying
We should get_married
We should get_married
You've_got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've_got a friend in me
Yeah, you've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
You got troubles
And I got them too
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you
We stick together, we can see it through
Cause you've_got a friend in me
You've_got a friend in me
Some other folks might be a little_bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none_of them
Will ever love you
The way I do
It's me and you, boy
And as the years go by,
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've_got a friend in me
Hey girls, gather round
Listen to what I'm putting down
Hey babe, I'm your handy man
I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule
I'm handy with love and I'm no fool
I fix broken hearts,
I know that I truly can
If your broken_heart should need repair
Then I'm the man to see
I whisper sweet things,
you tell all your friends
They'll come runnin' to me
Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts,
I know that I truly can
Come, come, come
Yeah, yeah,_yeah
Come, come, come
Yeah, yeah,_yeah
They'll come runnin' to me
That's me
Part of me Has Died
won't return
part_of me Wants to hide
part that's burned
Once_once
Knew how to talk to you
Once_once
not anymore
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
Part of me Has vied
To watch it burn
And the heart of me Has tried
But look what it's become
Once_once
I knew how to look for you
Once_once
But that was before
Once_once
I would have laid down to
died for you
Once_once
But not anymore
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
Hear the sirens
call me home
I really can't stay
Baby it's cold_outside
I've got to go away
But baby it's cold_outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands
they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry
My_father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half
a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
Neighbors might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat
your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Mind if I move in closer
At_least I'm gonna say
that I tried
What's the sense
in hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold_outside
I simply must go
Baby it's cold_outside
Oh the answer is no
Baby it's cold_outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look_out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh your_lips look delicious
My brother will be there
at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind
is so vicious
Your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home
Maybe you'll freeze out there
Say lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At_least there will be
plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt
Baby it's cold_outside
You take a deep_breath
and you walk through the doors
Its the morning of your
very_first day
you say hi to your friends you
aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
its your freshman year
and youre gonna be here
for the next four years
in this town
hoping one of those senior boys
will wink at you and say
you know I havent seen you around
before
Cause when youre_fifteen
and somebody tells you
they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre_fifteen
feeling like there
nothing to figure_out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before who youre
know who you gonna be fifteen
You sit in class next to a
redhead named Abigail
and soon enough youre best friends
laughing at the other girls
who think theyre so cool
well be out of here
as soon_as we can
and then youre on your very
first_date and hes got a car
and youre feeling like flying
and youre momas waiting up
and you think hes the one
and youre dancing round your room
when the night end
when the night ends
Cause when youre_fifteen
and somebody tell you
they love you
youre gonna believe them
when youre_fifteen
and your first kiss
makes your head spin round but
in your life youll do thing greater
than dating the
boy on the football team
but I didnt know it at fifteen
When all you wanted
was to be wanted
wish you could go back
and tell yourself what you know now
Back_then I swore
I was gonna marry him someday
but I realized some bigger
dreams of mine
and Abigail gave everything
she had to a boy
who changed his mind and
we_both cried
Cause when youre_fifteen
and somebody tells you
they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre_fifteen
dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found that time
can heal most anything
and you just might find who youre
supposed to be
I didnt know who
I was supposed to be at fifteen
Youre very_first day
take a deep_breath girl
take a deep_breath as you walk
through those doors
I used_to think one day
we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks
flew instantly
And people would say
they're the lucky ones
I used_to know my place
was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room
for an_empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know
what page you're on
Oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fall out
So_many things
that I wish you knew
So_many walls up
I can't break through
Now I'm standing_alone
in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's_killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
when it all broke_down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy_now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling
at my clothes and trying
to look busy
And you're_doing your
best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day
I'll tell the story of us
how I was losing my mind
when I saw you here
But you held your pride like
you should've held me
Oh I'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending
this is nothing
I'd tell you I miss you
but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite
this loud
Now I'm standing_alone
in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's_killing me Yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
when it all broke_down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy_now
This_is looking like a contest
Of who can act_like they careless
But I liked it better
when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather
love than fight
So_many things that you
wish I knew but the story of us
might be ending soon
Now I'm standing_alone
in a crowded_room
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killing you like
it's_killing me yeah
I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
when it all broke_down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy NOW NOW NOW YEAH
And we're not_speaking
And I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's_killing me yeah
And I don't know what to say
since a twist_of fate
cause we're_going down
And the story of us looks a lot
like a tragedy_now
the end
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought
I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and
its all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you
like it's all a big mistake
Oh holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your
eyes go cold
Come on come on
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Something's_gone terribly_wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on come on
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Can't_breathe whenever_you're gone
Can't turn back now
I'm haunted
Stood there and watched you walk_away
From everything we had
But I still mean
every_word I say to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing
he was you instead
Oh holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me
holding on to nothing
Come on come on
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Something's_gone terribly_wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on come on
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Can't_breathe whenever_you're gone
Can't turn back now
I'm haunted
I know I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
No
Come on come on
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Something's_gone terribly_wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come_on, come on
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured_out
Can't_breathe whenever_you're gone
I can't go back
I'm haunted
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought_I'd see it break
Never_thought I'd see it
I said remember this_moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our
shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced
like you knew our_lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It_was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long_live the walls
we crashed_through
How the kingdom_lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming_long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One_day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that
we stood there
On the side lines
wishing for right_now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your
baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we help them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming this is absurd
Cause for a moment a
band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to
rule the world
Long_live the walls
we crashed_through
How the kingdom_lights
shined just for me and you
I was screaming_long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long_live all the
mountains we_moved
I had the time of
my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming_long
live the look on your_face
And bring on all the pretenders
One_day we will be remembered
Hold on
Just spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Can you take a moment
promise me this
That you'll stand_by me forever
But if God forbid fate
should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please_tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds
went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long_live the walls
we crashed_through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we
crashed_through
How the kingdom_lights shined
just for me and you
I was screaming_long live all
the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing long live all
the mountains we_moved
I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
Long long live the
look on your_face
And bring on all the pretenders
One_day we will be remembered
Hey little girl, braids in your hair
Big bad world but you ain't scared, no
��Cause nobody's gone and told ya
To shut up, play nice, do what you're told
Marry into money and don��t ever let him go
Is what they're gonna tell ya
'Cause it's two steps back and one step forward
The judge and the jury are workin' for each_other
They ain't gonna tell you how to play the game
Chorus
Little_girl, don't ever let_'em keep you down
Little_girl, dream bigger_than they tell you how

Keep those lights on
Toys on the front lawn
Disney World trip next summer
Used kit for our little air-drummer
Food on the table
Brand new cradle
For the angel that's coming in a minute
This house and everybody in it
Pre-Chorus
Got my bags packed, got my ticket
Got a heartache to go with it
Baby, kiss me, say you'll miss me
Oh, while we still got time
Chorus
Take a look_at our little paradise
It ain't much but baby, you and I
Picked the right stars, made the right wish
Ain't_nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
That every_time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for
Verse_2
When I'm out there
I know I'm where
I'm meant to be picking them strings
And getting that small_town to sing
On that last turn home
I can_hardly wait
To drop my bags, kiss your_face
'Cause all I can do is stop and
Chorus
Take a look_at our little paradise
It ain't much but baby, you and I
Picked the right stars, made the right wish
Ain't_nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
That every_time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for, ooh
Pre-Chorus
Oh, got my bags packed, got my ticket
Got a heartache to go with it
Baby, kiss me, say you'll miss me
While we still got time
Chorus
Take a look_at our little paradise
It ain't much but baby, you and I
Picked the right stars, made the right wish
Ooh, ain't nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
You know that this heart of mine is yours
You know that this heart is yours
Oh, and every_time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for
Outro
Mmh-hm
We had some_fun
we had some laughs
I licked the salt
right off the glass
Danced to the music
racked up a tab
I thought you were thinking
what I was thinking
Thought we were going somewhere
with all this drinking
Well I guess the Cuervo
it led me on
'Cause I turned around
and you were gone
You're just a waste of lime
Waste of a real good time
I guess I'll be going home
all alone
No Patron Silver lining
Just an_empty margarita
Left me and this tequila
high and dry
No drunk pickup lines
No Your place or mine
You're just a waste of lime
Bermuda Bahama
guess I'm never gonna
Meet your_mama or brother
nothin' left to do
Well I'd take a kiss
no second date
And I'd take a two-mile
in-the-rain walk of shame
Yeah that'd be great
compared to this
Oh baby what a miss
You're just a waste of lime
Waste of a real good time
I guess I'll be going home
all alone
No Patron Silver lining
Just an_empty margarita
Left me and this tequila
high and dry
No drunk pickup lines
No Your place or mine
You're just a waste of lime
Bermuda Bahama
guess I'm never gonna
Meet your_mama or brother
nothin' left to do
But have another tequila
just enough to know that
I don't need ya
don't need ya nah
You're just a waste of lime
Waste of a real good time
I guess I'll be going home
all alone
No Patron Silver lining
Just an_empty margarita
Left me and this tequila
high and dry
No drunk pickup lines
No Your place or mine
You're just a waste of lime
Bermuda Bahama
guess I'm never gonna
Yeah you're just a waste of lime
Meet your_mama or brother
nothin' left to do
But have another
Every city street
Would be celebrating
All the evergreens
Would be decorated
And there'd still be a million lights
There'd still be mistletoe
But it wouldn't feel the same
'Cause all I know is
Christmas_isn't Christmas
if it's not with you
Red and green and silver bells
would all be blue
All the presents are just boxes
with no_one to give them to
'Cause Christmas_isn't Christmas
if it's not with you
Oh-oh_oh-oh oh-oh_oh-oh
Oh-oh_oh-oh oh-oh_oh-oh
It'd be just a day
at the end of December
And a lonely night
if you and I weren't together
And those songs wouldn't
sound the same
Home wouldn't feel like home
I'm thankful you're here tonight
'Cause all I know is
Christmas_isn't Christmas
if it's not with you
Red and green and silver bells
would all be blue
All the presents are just boxes
with no_one to give them to
'Cause Christmas_isn't Christmas
if it's not with you
With you holding me close
Looking out the window
While we watch the snow come down
Oh it's true ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Christmas_isn't Christmas
if it's not with you
Red and green and silver bells
would all be blue
All the presents are just boxes
with no_one to give them to
Oh 'cause Christmas_isn't Christmas
if it's not with you
Oh-oh_oh-oh oh-oh_oh-oh
Oh-oh_oh-oh oh-oh_oh-oh
If it's not with you
Oh-oh_oh-oh oh-oh_oh-oh
Oh-oh_oh-oh oh-oh_oh-oh
Hold on to things
that make you stronger
You know love is right
around the corner
We fall by the wayside
Keep hanging on a cloud
Ouh ouh_ouh ouh
Too young to be right
Soon too old to fight
Ouh ouh_ouh
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado
And let it all get out of hand
Sitting by the water
Time feels right
Better_run fast_enough
while you still can
Hold on your fingers on a trigger
Run far
won’t keep on waiting longer
Heading to the seaside
We know we’ll be fine
Ouh ouh_ouh ouh
Ready for the fight
Ain’t too_late to be right
Ouh ouh_ouh
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado
And let it all get out of hand
Sitting by the water
Time feels right
Better_run fast_enough
while you still can
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado
And let it all get out of hand
Sitting by the water
Time feels right
Better_run fast_enough
while you still can
Better_run far
While you can ooh
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado
And let it all get out of hand
Sitting by the water
Time feels right
Better_run fast_enough
while you still can
Can we drive to San Diego
Stay in Coronado
And let it all get out of hand
Sitting by the water
Time feels right
Better_run fast_enough
while you still can
Ouh ouh_ouh
-ay-ay
Talk about it, dream about it
Joke about it, worry_about it
Lie about it, laugh about it
Leaning on it, learning about it
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
All we know is
that the feelings are strong
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
It all depends
which side you are on
Shy about it, cry about it
Ask about it, honest about it
Taken by it, shaken by it
Aching a bit
when you're denied of it
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
All we know is
that the feelings are strong
Who's to say
what's right or what's wrong?
It all depends
which side you are on
And now we got to know it,
how can we erase?
How can we un-know it? Love
Although it may upset you,
you chose me just as much
And I should just forget you, no
Eyes of brown
Beautiful and she's so warm to just be around
My heart, it pounds
That she is more_than a pretty_face lost in the crowd
[Chorus]
Won't you lie_next to me, oh,_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh,_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh,_Kayla?
Won't you lie, oh, next to me, okay love?
Okay
[Verse_2]
Rose-like cheeks
You'll tell me I'm wrong and that's just because you don't like what you see
Just know I do and
All of the time, you're on my mind, making me blind
[Chorus]
Won't you lie_next to me, oh,_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh,_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh,_Kayla?
Won't you lie, oh, next to me, okay love
Okay
Okay love, okay
I know a place
That's sound and safe
For us now
No need to hide
Or say goodbyes
Leave them out
We'll run_away
It'll be okay
Hmm
Bum bah dum dum
We can chase waterfalls
And talk 'til all my hair dries
Just lie on the sand
Each hand in hand
In paradise
'Cause we don't got long
'Til we say so long
Hmm
Dum dah dum dum dah duh duh dum dah
We can live in this lovely dream
It'll be my reality
Hmm
I know a place
That has no trace
Of us now
It's just a thought
So don't tell me it's wrong
Every day felt_like Friday
Walking to the 7-Eleven
Me and all of my best friends
We were always together
I remember talking on the phone
all night
Didn't know it was a simple time
Wish that I could
put this game on pause
Skip this round
take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like
there's_nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown_up kinda sucks
And I'm really just
missing the simple times ah-ha
I think I'm going off
of the deep_end
I wanna wake_up on an_island
Throw еverybody a peace sign
Put all thе static on silent
We can stay up all night
Pour one out for the simple times
Wish that I could
put this game on pause
Skip this round
take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like
there's_nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown_up kinda sucks
And I'm really just
missing the simple times ah-ha
There's_nothing really going on
But I heard about a rager
I won't be waiting by the phone
So you can hit me on the pager
Oh-oh_oh-oh oh-oh
Wish that I could
put this game on pause
Skip this round
take the headset off
Put my high-tops on
Kick it at the mall like
there's_nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown_up kind_of sucks
And I'm really just
missing the simple times ah-ha
Oo-ooo oo-oo oo-oo oo-oo
Praise the Lord for southern women

Praise the Lord

Crystal vibration
Down by the boardwalk
Stock up on mood rings
Elephant-shaped rock
We both stopped drinkin'
We still have fun
'Cause LA is sinkin'
So fight everyone
We fight everyone
We fight everyone
We fight everyone
We fight everyone
White birds in motion
Down by the sea
Band on the pavement
Playing Britney
I never noticed
The weight of this song
We stop to listen
I sing_along
We sing_along
We sing_along
We sing_along
We sing_along
Then we go out late at night
We’re not that brave
but we're high
Try not to hurt anyone
Then you stand on my shoulders
You're high enough to see
all the serial killers
Heads look like drums
of you squint the right way
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Drugs they start working
We know what to do
We end up on Sunset
We must look confused
A man tries to help us
And asks if we're safe
We both start laughing
'Cause it's way too_late
It's way too_late
It's way too_late
It's way too_late
It's way too_late
Then we go home late at night
We're not that safe
but we're fine
We're seeing how far we can run
When I stand on your shoulders
I'm high enough to see
all the serial killers
Heads look like drums
of you squint the right way
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh_oh oh_oh
And I'm never gonna
waste your love on me
Oh_oh oh_oh
And I'm never gonna
waste good drugs on me
Oh_oh oh_oh
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel sometimes
I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel sometimes
So I, I get high
I don't wanna text, I don't wanna talk, I don't wanna call you back
I just wanna live, I just wanna love, feel just a little_less bad
So I, I get high
I could be out with a stranger
Home with someone I love
Could be when I'm feeling good or feel like I'm not enough
So I, I get high
Wanna stay awake, wanna stay asleep
Anything to pass the time
Sick of growing up, sick of being young
I just wanna feel alive
So I, oh I, I fly
It's when I'm home with my family
Or I'm out on the road
I'm the center of attention or completely alone
That's why
I get high
I get high
I get high
I can't hide myself
I don't expect you to understand
I just hope I can explain
What it's like to be a man
It's a lonely road
And they don't_care 'bout what you know
It's not 'bout how you feel
But what you provide inside that home
Yeah, I know this life can really beat you down, uh
You wanna scream but you won't make a sound, uh
Got so_much weight that you've_been holdin'
But won't show any emotion, as a man, that goes unspoken
That we can't cry when life gets hard
Unconditional love for women, children and dogs
We know that we just have to play our parts
And don't nobody give a damn about our broken hearts, yeah
As a man, we gotta pave our way
Our only function is to work and slave
There's_no respect for you if you ain't paid
You're disregarded as a human and you can't complain
And if you ever make it up and actually reach that place
And find a woman that you love and give her your last name
You'll feel the things that you provide is only why she stays
And when you try to explain, you'll say
I can't hide myself
I don't expect you to understand
I just hope I can explain
What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)
It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)
And they don't_care 'bout what you know (care 'bout what you know)
It's not 'bout how you feel
But what you provide inside that home
Don't give up, keep fightin'
As a man, our son is our horizon
And our fathers' actions play a role and we end up like him
So they can't let us see them hurt
'Cause we'll embody what we do and start a generational curse
No wonder most men are so depressed
All the things that they can't express
They go to war, get thrown on the shelf
Then go back to war with they mental health
Then grab that bottle and ask for help
Try to pull themselves out of hell
Then fall back down and then realize
That they gon'_have to do it themselves
It's the circle of life, as a man, you provide
They don't know what you're worth 'til the day that you die
And that's when they start cryin'
Then move on to a man to confide in
That's why we feel
We can't hide ourselves
We don't expect you to understand
We just hope we can explain
What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)
It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)
And you don't_care 'bout what we know (care 'bout what we know)
It's not 'bout how we feel
But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)
That home
It's not 'bout how we feel
But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)
Ooh-ooh, ooh,_ooh, ooh
It's been a long year
Would we survive in a horror movie?
I doubt it, we're too slow moving
We trust everyone we meet
Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat
And stare_at a drive-in screen
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried oh,_oh-oh, oh,_oh-oh, oh
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
Everywhеrе, everything, I wanna lovе you
'Til we'rе food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
(Mm-hmm-mm) Drive slowly,
I know every route in this county
And maybe that ain't such a bad thing
I'll tell where not to speed
And it's been a long year
And all of our book's pages dog-eared
We write out the ends on our palms, dear
Then forget to read
And we couldn't know that
the sun was collapsing
Until the seas rose and
the buildings came crashing
We cried oh,_oh-oh, oh,_oh-oh, oh,_oh
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hand in yours
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hand in yours
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh)
(Woah-oh)
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, I'll keep my hands in yours
The tune that I'm singing
I might have borrowed
The truth that I'm telling
Might not be true
The gifts that I bring
They_might be stolen
But I'm here right_now
And I will give them to you
They_say that it's over
Well I don't believe it
They tell me it's gone
But that can't be true
And if it's lost
Well I'm gonna find it
Turn me a page
Let's start anew
Lend me your ears
And I'll sing you a secret
If you take my hand
I'll get you there
I give you my word
And this time I mean it
But if you turn me away
Save me a prayer
They_say that it's over
Well I don't believe it
They tell me it's gone
But that can't be true
And if it's lost
Well I'm gonna find it
Turn me a page
Let's start anew
Yesterdays gone
And I'm right behind it
The storm when it comes
Let it rain down on me
It's sad and it's true
But you laid it on the line
And in a little while
You'll be free
In a little while
We'll be free
In a little while
We'll be free
In a little while
We'll be free
when past sometimes takes
you with soft hands
forcelessly pulls you to your chair
hides you away_from these half days
sunless at the end of the year
the air is like a knife
cutting through you
a room in the house is always
warm stretched out
on the bathroom floor thinking
of fair days your future may hold
love comes like surprise_ice
on the water
love comes like surprise_ice at dawn
love comes like surprise_ice
on the water
love comes at dawn
deprived of the light and of colours
the world ends at your
windowtree darkness creates
these illusions
but pale days can teach you to see
rain falls but no life is given
weeks pass no progress is made
past sometimes takes you
with soft hands
and all that surrounds you will fade
love comes like surprise_ice
on the water
love comes like surprise_ice at dawn
love comes like surprise_ice
on the water
love comes at dawn
Well it's a sad picture
the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets
what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same
another time and place
Repeating history and
you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do_anything to see it through
Because these_things will change
Can you feel it now
These_walls that they put up to
hold us back will fall down
This revolution
the time will come
For us to finally_win
And we’ll sing_hallelujah
we'll sing_hallelujah
Oh_oh
So we've_been outnumbered
raidеd and now cornered
It's hard to fight
when thе fight ain't_fair
We're getting stronger now
finding things they never found
They_might be bigger
but we're faster and never scared
You can walk_away
say we don't need this
But there’s_something in your eyes
says we can beat this
’Cause these_things will change
Can you feel it now
These_walls that they put up to
hold us back will fall down
This revolution
the time will come
For us to finally_win
And we'll sing_hallelujah
we’ll sing_hallelujah
Oh_oh
Tonight we'll stand
get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked
for all these_years
And the battle was long
it's the fight of our_lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight
It_was the night things changed
Can you see it now
When the walls that they put up to
hold us back fell down
It's a revolution
throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing_hallelujah
we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
Untouchable like a distant
diamond sky
I'm reaching out and
I just can't tell you why
I'm caught_up in you
I'm caught_up in you
Untouchable
burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close
I feel like coming_undone
In the middle_of the night
when I'm in this dream
It's like a million_little stars
spelling_out your name
You got to come on come on
say that we'll be together
Come on come on
little taste of heaven
It's half full and
I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that
you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable
burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close

Blue songs are like tattoos
You know I've_been to sea betore
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail_away
Hey blue here is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty_space to fill in
Well there're so_many sinking now
You've_got to keep thinking
You can make it thru these waves
Acid booze and ass
Needles guns and grass
Lots of laughs lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that
hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a
look around it though
Blue I love you
Blue here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There_is your song from me
Well a man come on the 6 olock news
Said somebody been shot,
somebody been abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn get too_far yeah
They didn get too_far
Grandpappy told my pappy,
back in my day, son
A man had to answer
for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree,
round up all of them bad boys
Hang them high in the street for
all the people to see that
Justice is the one_thing
you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles
we l sing a victory tune
We l all meet back at the local saloon
We l raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men,
beer for my horses
We got too_many gangsters doing dirty deeds
too_much crime in the streets
It time the long arm of the law put
a few more in the ground
Send all to their maker and he l settle_down
You can bet he l set down ause
Justice is the one_thing
you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles
we l sing a victory tune
We l all meet back at the local saloon
We l raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men,
beer for my horses
whiskey for my men,
beer for my horses
Justice is the one_thing
you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles
we l sing a victory tune
We l all meet back at the local saloon
We l raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men,
beer for my horses
Singing whiskey for my men,
beer for my horses
Ev'ryone considered him
the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time
to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy
the folks just called him yellow
But something always told me
they were reading Tommy wrong
He was only ten_years old
when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy
'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words
my brother said to Tommy
Son my life is over
but yours is just begun
Promise me son
not to do the things I've_done
Walk away_from trouble
if you can
It won't mean you're weak
if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough
to understand
Son you don't have to fight
to be a man
There's someone for ev'ryone
and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have
to prove he was a man
One_day while he was workin'
the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky
There was three of them
Tommy opened up the door
and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress
the shattered look was more
than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace
and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face
he heard these_words again
Promise me son
not to do the things I've_done
Walk away_from trouble
if you can
It won't mean you're weak
if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough
to understand
Son you don't have to fight
to be a man
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him
halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned
around they said
Hey look ol' yellow's leavin'
But you coulda heard a pin drop
when Tommy stopped and
blocked the door
Twenty years of crawlin'
was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin' nothin' back
he let_'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom
not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said This one's for Becky
as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say
I promised you Dad
not to do the things you done
I walk_away from trouble
when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak
I didn't turn the other cheek
and Papa
I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight
when you're a man
Ev'ryone considered him
the coward of the county
And here's to you, Mrs._Robinson
Jesus_loves you more_than you will know (Wo,_wo, wo)
God_bless you please,_Mrs. Robinson
Heaven_holds a place for those_who pray
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
We'd like to know a little_bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home
And here's to you, Mrs._Robinson
Jesus_loves you more_than you will know
(Wo,_wo, wo)
God_bless you please,_Mrs. Robinson
Heaven_holds a place for those_who pray
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
Hide it in a hiding place where no_one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've_got to hide it from the kids
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs_Robinson
Jesus_loves you more_than you will know
(Wo,_wo, wo)
God_bless you please,_Mrs. Robinson
Heaven_holds a place for those_who pray
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've_got to choose
Ev'ry way you look_at it, you lose
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
(Woo, woo, woo)
What's that you say, Mrs._Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
(Hey,_hey, hey...hey,_hey, hey)
I`m letting_go
To see if you`ll hold on to me
I`m in doubt
Of what is thought
and what is real
In our room
Between the shapes
I thought I knew
A guillotine
A pillow with feathers like snow
I`ve come
To a listening post
beyond your lines
I`m all ears
To gather clues and look for signs
But I can`t hear
The song you sing
while you try to soothe
Why are you whispering
While the bombs are falling
Go easy on me
I can`t help what I`m doing
Go easy on me
Oh I can`t help what I`m doing
Hello again
I buried you where have you been
My renegade
You came back from the labyrinth
Unlike me
You`ve looked for things
that could be found
And the thread
That guides through black times
Go easy on me
I can`t help what I`m doing
Go easy on me
Oh I can`t help what I`m doing
When thoughts
Had outnumbered spoken words
In the early hours
We failed to establish
Who was hurt
Most
Feeling the comfort of
eyes is your sole intention.
We all want to be understood
unconditionally.
But you have to realize
that a viewer needs distance.
And the moment your wall
melts down-the inside is outside.
Maybe way back in the past
when people different,
shortening bonds made them last.
Now we emphasize our difference.
We have been enrolled one by one
for the Peacetime Resistance.
and we're fighting our battles alone.
We've got four eyes-so why
yearn for one perspective?
We've got colours
with shades erased
when blended
We've got four eyes
so why yearn for one perspective?
We've got colours,
but they disappear when blended.
If we never found this love
If we never took that road
If we hadn`t had the heart
We wouldn`t have this home
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
In this world the heart beats slow
In my arms let`s share the cold
In my eyes your all I`ve known
Darlin let`s go home
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Love love will take you
Love love will take you there
Oh pour me another drink
And punch me in the face
You can call me Nancy
Every man wears a symbol
And I know I have mine
I've got my right hand stamped
In the concentration camp
where my organs scream slow down man
Milk and honey flow
Just a_couple states below
Oh hook me up to the tank
And roll me to the door
I'm going where my body leads me
I can fend for myself
With what looks I have left
I'll put away a few
And pretty soon
I'll be breaking things I have of you
Milk and honey flow
Just a_couple states below
Forgive me how it was
A place under the sun
Before the devil made me run
Run boy run boy
You can't right click on a face
You can't be the winner of
the human race
You can't do everything in this place
But don't die curious
You can't be the healer of every soul
You can't be the Queen all on your own
You can't beat the nighttime
with a glow
But don't die curious
You can't count every_single
grain of sand
You can't save a heart
by holding a hand
You can't make everyone understand
But don't die curious
Hello words that I just did not say
I found a way to hesitate, to deviate
Oh, we just died curious
You can't be a runner with a broken toe
You can't paint a painting
like Van Gogh
You can't pronounce
everything right, you know?
But don't die curious
You can't move a mountain in a beat
You can't find the truth of
everyone you meet
You can't kiss a stranger in the street
But don't die curious
Hello words that I just did not say
I found a way to hesitate, to deviate
Oh, we just died curious
You can't change a mind
without a fight
Waiting_for the hope of a morning_light
You can't find love on your own tonight
Hello life that I just did not do
Ignored the clues, I ran from you
I found the blues
Oh, we just died
Hello words that I just did not say
I found a way to hesitate, to deviate
Oh, we just died curious
Outside outside it's cold
That wild wind Old Man
Winter's on a roll
But if you could
come a little_closer
You could keep me warm
And we could leave our mittens
in the drawers
It's a beautiful_day
to be with you
It's a beautiful_day
to be with you
Oh when I see your_face it's true
The sky's a brighter blue
It's a beautiful_day
to be with you
Outside it feels_like rain
These old knees they tell me
Thunder's on the way
But if you could
come a little_closer
That's all I would need
April showers become
distant memories
It's a beautiful_day
to be with you
It's a beautiful_day
to be with you
Oh when I see your_face it's true
The sky's a brighter blue
It's a beautiful_day
to be with you
So why don't you
come a little_closer
Until those skies are clear
And we can watch
our troubles disappear
It's a beautiful_day
It's a beautiful_day
It's a beautiful_day
It's a beautiful_day
It's a beautiful_day
It's a beautiful_day
It's a beautiful_day
It's a beautiful_day
to be with you
Girl our mamas are best friends
and so are we
The_whole town's rooting for us
like the home team
Most likely to settle_down
Plant a few roots real deep
and let_'em grow
But we can't stop this real
world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called
I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all
packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more
than a California sunset
More_than a beer
when you ain't twenty-one yet
More_than a Sunday_morning Lord
Turnin' some poor
lost souls 'round
and Hallelujah bound
Yeah I love you more
than the feeling
when the bass
hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl
at the end of the book
But baby this might
be the last time
I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more
than my hometown
I ain't the runaway kind
I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these
streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame man
to think that
I love you more
than a California sunset
More_than a beer
when you ain't twenty-one yet
More_than a Sunday_morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls
around and Hallelujah bound
Yeah I love you more
than the feeling
when the bass
hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl
at the end of the book
But baby
this might be the last time
I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more
than my hometown
Yeah you got a wild
in your eyes
that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup
of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill
girl not in 'em
So hang onto these_words
'til them avenues help
you forget 'em
'Cause I love you more
than a California sunset
I love you more
in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car
you got your keys in
Girl but I hate even more
that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more
than the feeling
when the bass
hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl
at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so
I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more
than my hometown
Love you more_than my hometown
Love you more_than my hometown
Love you more baby love you more
All the places I could be
Too_many to choose
I’m getting tired_of East LA
Oh I think it’s time to move
I’m spending all my money
I’m losing all my friends
And I’ll be left with nothing
If this don’t ever end
Let’s just go
Find a road
And follow all the signs
That lead to Colorado
Let’s just go
Find a home
And maybe settle_down
For a_couple months_or so
Colorado
Saying things I’ve never said
Doing things I never did
Everybody here is so in love
Until the next one walks in
I’m spending all my money
I’m losing all my friends
And I’ll be left with nothing
If this don’t ever end
Let’s just go
Find a road
And follow all the signs
That lead to Colorado
Let’s just go
Find a home
And maybe settle_down
For a_couple months_or so
Colorado
Take me to the place I know
Take me to the hills
where my mother was grown
Let’s just go
Find a road
And follow all the signs
That lead to Colorado
Let’s just go
Find a home
And maybe settle_down
For a_couple months_or so
Colorado
I could be a sinner
I could be a saint
I could be the savior
You look for when you pray
Maybe I’m the dealer
Maybe I’m the drug
I’d never be judge
They’re always locking people up
I could be anywhere
Anyone that I like
And I don’t need a reason_why
I could sell all my things
And leave behind
this load I’m carrying
When you’re dreaming
in these times
All you’ve got is a moonshot
I could be a sailer
I could be in space
I could be a cowboy
Riding through the open range
Or_maybe I’m the shadow
Standing by your side
I bet that you would see me
If you didn’t avoid the light
Or I could have a family
I could have some kids
I could tell the world
That its the best_thing I did
I could be anywhere
Anyone that I like
And I don’t need a reason_why
I could sell all my things
And leave behind
this load I’m carrying
When you’re dreaming
in these times
All you’ve got is a moonshot
Baby I’ve_been living
Really I’ve_been fine
Just wanted you to listen
To me say it one_more time
It's been a little_bit cold these_days
'Cause I don't know what it means
To be held by somebody who loves me
Been a little_bit lonely and afraid
To go searching for somebody
Who will love me the way
that he loved me
Early mornin' on mind
Sleepin' dreamin' of you all the time
Words that you told me
Words that'll_haunt me
Early mornin' on mind
Sleepin' dreamin' of you all the time
Words that you told me
Words that'll_haunt
It's been a little_bit hard
to hold_onto hope
When it feels_like
I won't ever be good enough
For someone to want me
I've_been a little_bit desperate
And to cope
I've_been lying to myself
about the way
That I felt when you left me
Early mornin' on mind
Sleepin' dreamin' of you all the time
Words that you told me
Words that'll_haunt me
Early mornin' on mind
Sleepin' dreamin' of you all the time
Words that you told me
Words that'll_haunt me
Oh_oh oh_oh
I remember your bare feet
down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes
looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing
before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in
and whispered to you
Come on baby with me
we're_going to fly_away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to
crying and screaming Why
Flowers pile up in the worst way
no_one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted
if you were still here
I remember the last day
when I kissed your_face
And whispered in your ear
Come on baby with me
we're_going to fly_away from here
Out of this curtained room
and this hospital gray
we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
we're_going to fly_away from here
You were my best four years
What if I'm standing in your closet
trying to talk to you
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs
you won't grow into
And what if I really thought
some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was
even getting one moment with you
Come on baby with me
we're_going to fly_away from here
Come on baby with me
we're_going to fly_away from here
You were my best four years
I remember your bare feet
down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back
[Verse_1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more_than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old_pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Verse_2]
There's_no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's_nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old_pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old_pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In_case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old_pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn
Well, if you wanted honesty
that's all you had to say
I never want to
let you down or have you go
It's better off this way
for all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
What will it take to show you
that it's not the life it seems
I told you time and time again
You sing the words
but don't know what it means
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as
we_both shook for the last time
Take a good hard look
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
Oh,_oh, oh, woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh,_oh, oh, oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh,_oh, oh,_oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Forget about the dirty looks
Thе photographs
your boyfriend took
You said you read me likе a book
But the pages are all torn
and frayed now
I'm okay
I'm okay
I'm okay now I'm okay now
But if you really listen to me
I'll tell you the truth, trust me
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay-ay
I'm not okay
I know that you are having a hard
Time right_now
That everything seems to crumble
Around you
[Chorus]
I know that you feel all alone in this world
But you have to put your trust into us
And we will help you through
'Cause we only want what's best
What's best for you
[Verse_2]
I know that you are having trouble
Leaving right_now
But everything is gonna be
Is gonna be alright
[Chorus]
I know that you feel all alone in this world
But you have to put your trust into us
And we will help you through
'Cause we only want what's best
What is best for you, ooh
[Bridge]
Ooh oh_oh
Ooh oh_oh
Ooh oh_oh
[Chorus]
I know that you feel all alone in this world
But you have to put your trust into us
And we will help you through
'Cause we only want what's best
What's best for you
[Outro]
For you
What is best for you
For you
[Verse_1]
(I'm) Waiting at the door step
(I')m finally home
I haven't gone for too long
Standing here while just taking all in
Radio's playing a song
Then you stood there smiling at me
As so_many times before
I never wanna be [missing word] leave you again
You're all I want more
[Chorus]
It's true
If only I could do one thing, I'll be with you
It's true
Baby how I need the [missing words] you
[Verse_2]
I'm waiting at the door step
(I')m finally home
I haven't gone for too long
Standing here while just taking all in
Radio's playing a song
[Chorus]
It's true
If only I could do one thing, I'll be with you
It's true
Baby how I need the [missing words] you
[missing verse]
[Outro]
(I'm) Waiting at the door step
(I')m finally home
I haven't gone for too long
[Chorus]
It's true
If only I could do one thing, I'll be with you
It's true
Baby how I need the [missing words] you
Baby how I need the [missing words] you
Baby how I need the [missing words] you
One, two, three, four
[Verse_1]
Hysteria in the morning flush
In the vapid rush
Hysteria, hold me down
These rivers in my eyes
Hysteria, I love you
Don't wanna go home
Hysteria don't know how to grow
This winter chills my bones
[Chorus]
Silver diamond threads, they travel
Watch my, watch my soul unravel
[Verse_2]
Hysteria in the weightless crush
Wanna hold you so_much
Hysteria in the weightless crush
Wanna hold you so_much
Hysteria, now it's time to leave
And I cannot feel my hands
Hysteria, you're telling me to breathe
I'm going to the promised lands
[Chorus]
Silvеr diamond threads, they travel
Watch my, watch my soul unravеl
[Verse_3]
Hysteria in the vacant numb
Hysteria, we've gone too_far
Hysteria in the swelling dream
Hysteria in the silent screams
Hysteria, don't let go
Hysteria, come to me
Hysteria, I'm so sorry
Hysteria let love please
[Chorus]
Silver diamond threads, they travel
Watch, watch my soul unravel
I wish I would've met you anywhere but where I did
Some old high rise town that I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around In some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like
[Pre-Chorus]
We were listenin' to One More Silver Dollar
Hanging out my Silverado
Down a road I love to ride
[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
[Verse_2]
I don't_care how_much they're bitin'
I won't even crank thе boat
Soon as that bobber hits the water
Girl, your mеmory starts to float
Baby, why'd l ever take the bait
And take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know
[Pre-Chorus]
I even took you to my hometown to meet my Mama
Now, I'm gonna see you every_time
I see that welcome sign
[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hear One More Silver Dollar
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used_to ride
[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
[Chorus]
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey
'Cause you used_to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck
And now, I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Put your_lips close to mine
As_long as they don't touch
Out of focus eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too_much
And I'll do_anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk_away
But you're quicksand
This_slope is_treacherous
This path is reckless
This_slope is_treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
This_slope is_treacherous
This path is reckless
This_slope is_treacherous
And I I I like it
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless_night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I will follow you
follow you home
Follow you follow you home
This hope is_treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is_treacherous
I-I-I I-I-I I-I-I
Two headlights shine
through the sleepless_night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed
through my mind
And I just think you should
think you should know
That nothing safe
is worth the drive
And I will follow you
follow you home
Follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home
Follow you follow you home
This_slope is_treacherous
I-I-I like it
All this time I was wasting
hoping you would come around
I've_been giving out chances
every_time and all you
do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby
but I've figured you out
And you're thinking
we'll be fine again
but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
like I did_before
You're not_sorry
No no oh-oh
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you
if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
if you hadn't lеft me
waiting in the cold
And you've_got your sharе of secrets
And I'm tired_of being
last to know oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to
call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
like I did_before
You're not_sorry
No no oh-oh
You're not_sorry
No no oh-oh
You had me crawling
for you honey
And it never
would've gone away no
You used_to shine so bright
but I watched all of it fade
So you don't have
to call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
There's_nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
like I did_before
You're not_sorry
No no oh-oh
You're not_sorry
No no oh-oh
No no no no no no
no no no no no no
Woah_oh oh_oh oh_oh oh
Oh_oh oh no no no no no no
I'm five years old
it's getting cold
I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and
look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall_asleep
on the way home
I don't know why all the trees
change in the fall
But I know you're not scared
of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house
is near or far_away
But I know I had the best day
with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
could be so mean
I come home crying and you
hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive
until we found a town
far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to
talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long
it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
with you today
I have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
inside and out
He's better_than I am
I grew_up in a pretty house
and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There_is a video I found from back
when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate
ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady
in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees
change in the fall
I know you were on my side even
when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today
And it's a sad picture
the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you
wanted again and You know
it's all the same another time
and place Repeating history
and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do_anything to see it
through Because these_things
will change Do you feel it now
These_walls that they put up
to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will
come For us to finally_win
We sing_hallelujah
we sing_hallelujah
So we've_been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight
when the fight ain't_fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They_might be bigger But we're
faster and never scared
You can walk_away
say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
Because these_things will change
Do you feel it now
These_walls that they put up
to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally_win
We sing_hallelujah
we sing_hallelujah
Tonight we stand
get off our knees Fight for what
we've worked for all these_years
And the battle was long
it's the fight of our_lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
It_was the night things changed
Do you see it now
These_walls that they put up
to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution
throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sang hallelujah
we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
I can get caught on the other_side
On the other_side of the line
I got to take my time
Im gonna step on the other_side
On the other_side of the line
I got take my time
All the things I gave away
I gave everything I had
All the things that came my way we not so_bad
Im gonna run on the other_side
On the other_side of the norm
You Im feeling torn
I always felt in a different time
In a different time in the world
Id be a different girl
All the things I gave away
I gave everything I had
All the things that came my way we not so_bad
I can get caught on the other_side
On the other_side of the line
I got to take my time
I got to take my time
I got to take my time
I'm not always right
mostly I'm wrong
I'm half of a joke
and half of a sad song
when the sun sets at night
over the hill top
you can see my shadow dancing
we drink a few drinks
and sing a few songs
and share a few looks
and then I'll be gone
as the moon shines bright
over the hill top
you can see my shadow dancing
I love you like I love Madrid
it's a place I've never been
but it's such a pretty dream
you
and the morning
and the sound of Spain
you
and the morning
and the sound of Spain
She says
Wake_up it's no_use pretending
I'll keep stealing breathing her
Birds are leaving
over autumn's ending
One of us will die
inside these arms
Eyes wide_open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes
'round the yard
She says
If I leave before you darling
Don't you waste me in the ground
I lay smiling
like our sleeping children
One of us will die
inside these arms
Eyes wide_open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes
'round the yard
Hello hello Loretta darlin' I knew it was you
Loretta there's something I just got to tell you
Oh please tell me what to do
I don't really know how to say this but I want to tell you that I
You gave me the will to go on as soon_as I picked up the phone
No no you don't understand Loretta I'm trying to tell you that I
The talk is around that we're through yeah I know I've heard it too
Oh darling tell me what to do
But that's just it that's what I'm trying to tell you I wanna tell you that
I knew you'd tell me they were wrong as soon_as I picked up the phone
Oh but it's true they're not wrong
Oh no I'm sorry Loretta oh no I can't believe that it's true
I'm sorry Loretta I'm really really sorry
Oh no oh no I can't believe that we're through
I know you know that I never thought it would come to this
You tell me it's over and done
I really thought that I loved you and you know that
You say that you've had all your fun
You've just got to believe me that I never meant to hurt you
But I can't believe you've_been gone
This_is the hardest thing that I've ever had to do and it hurts me too
As soon_as I hang up the phone yeah I'll be gone
As soon_as I hang up the phone goodbye Loretta
How could it all fall in one day
Were we too sure of the sun
If you need to keep time on me
If you need to keep time on me
Who_knows what state is in store
If they all turn will you run
If you need to keep time on me
If you need to keep time on me
When I need to
I'll keep time on you
Wide oceans roar
A frightened fool
stokes heatless fire
But if you need to
keep time on me
If you need to keep time on me
How could it all fall in one day
Were we too sure of the sun
If you need to keep time on me
I'm breathing black and white
let it fool
Caught by your linen eyes
let_them fool
But I don't know where we went
My dear don't unfold me
And call it all pretend
Be here and be holy
I don't know where we went
My dear don't unfold me
I'm coloured in again
In you
Green where my red love lies
was it all
Don't wear your winning prize
let it fool
But I don't know where we went
My dear don't unfold me
And call it all pretend
Be here and be holy
I don't know where we went
My dear don't unfold me
I'm coloured in again
In you
Oh what a waste
I'll be locked in your heaven
always
Oh what a way to be living
with all of your pain
Oh what a way to be
locking your heaven away
Oh what a wave you have made
The_thrill is gone
The_thrill is gone away
The_thrill is gone baby
The_thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday
The_thrill is gone
It's gone away_from me
The_thrill is gone baby
The_thrill is gone away_from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be
The_thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
The_thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be over it all baby
Just like I know a good man should
You know I'm free, free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
What is this thing called love
This funny thing called love
Who can solve its mystery
Why should it make a fool of me
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
Just what is this thing called love
I don't have a car
To drive around in
I just have a heart
That I walk about In
I walk around
If I could I'd buy
You a house in laurel canyon
Underneath the moon above
In the shade of the mountain
I walk around
Life's been hard and you've lived a few
Did I give too_much love to you
I'm sorry but it's what I had to do
You needed love
I needed you
Back in my hometown
Looking_for a silver Honda
But there's too_many all around
And I fear I'll never find you
So I walk around
Hoping that one day
I'll see you driving up my street again
On your grandpa's bicycle
With your long hair blowing in the wind
And we'll walk around
Life's been hard and you've lived a few
Did I give too_much love to you
I'm sorry but it's what I had to do
You needed love
I needed you
Life's been hard and you've lived a few
Did I give too_much love to you
I'm sorry but it's what I had to do
You needed love
I needed you
All we are are ghosts
Shadows at the most
Our fingertips our holding on
To something that we know is gone
And though we are old friends
And drive around
the same_old bends
We've got our whole lives left
So don't leave your words unsaid
And down to our bones
I think we_both know
I know we're counting the cost
It's better to have lost
Than never have loved at all
Down to our bones
Bones
You say that you need space
to breathe
Well maybe you need space from me
You know just what I need
You said you couldn't
give it to me
And down to our bones
I think we_both know
I know we're counting the cost
It's better to have lost
Than never have loved at all
And down to our bones
I think we_both know
I know we're counting the cost
It's better to have lost
Than never have loved at all
Down to our bones
Bones
And down to our
What you say what you say
Say what you mean to say
'Cause I won't wait
no I won't wait
If you're gonna walk_away
What you say what you say
Say what you mean to say
'Cause I won't wait I won't wait
If you're gonna walk_away
What you say what you say
Say what you mean to say
'Cause I won't wait I won't wait
If you're gonna walk_away
What you say what you say
Say what you mean to say
'Cause I won't wait
no I won't wait oh
Down to our bones
I think we_both know
I know we're counting the cost
It's better to have lost
Than never have loved at all
Oh_Alice I can't continue this way
Oh_Alice faking_smiles
since you've_been away
Alice tell me what is his name
Oh_Alice breaking hearts
'cause no one's the same
The night we broke
you told me I wasn't enough
I had to throw my memories
on the shelf
You told me you
didn't need any of me
So I took a plane
just to help_myself
Oh_Alice I can't continue this way
Oh_Alice faking_smiles
since you've_been away
Alice tell me what is his name
Oh_Alice breaking
hearts 'cause no one's the same
I've changed my ways
I'm so different now
A second chance seems
like it would work somehow
You told me you
didn't need any of me
I'm_asking you
please just hear me out
Oh_Alice I can't continue this way
Oh_Alice faking_smiles
since you've_been away
Alice tell me what is his name
Oh_Alice breaking hearts
'cause no one's the same
Trying not to let go
Shadowing my echoes
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Trying not to let go
Why can't this be simple
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh_Alice I can't continue this way
Oh_Alice faking_smiles since
you've_been away
Alice tell me what is his name
Oh_Alice breaking hearts
'cause no one's the same
Tell me things
you've never said out_loud
Just try and go there if you can
Show me the parts of you
you're not that proud of
I want to know I'm just a man
I'll have you know
that I have good and bad days
Come on now love
don't be naive
Lay out our cards
and you'll see all my mistakes
Well I don't mind
while you're with me
When have I fallen
Am I crawling on my knees
Here I'm calling
In the hope that you'll see me
Whoa-oh-a-oh-oh
whoa-oh-a-oh-oh whoa-oh-a-oh-ohh
Whoa-oh-a-oh-oh
whoa-oh-a-oh-oh whoa-oh-a-oh-ohh
When have I fallen
Am I crawling on my knees
Here I'm calling
In the hope that you'll see me
When have I fallen
Am I crawling on my knees
Here I'm calling
In the hope that you'll see me
You live right down the road
I suppose
I picture a yellow house
That you call home
And when I think of you I feel
And thats enough for me
I really don’t need much more
Oh except maybe a love like
Anna
Like Anna
I need a love like Anna
I keep my head real low
And I see
Your shadow on the ground
Oh could it be you
But every_time I look
You’re gone gone
You left me with the feeling
That we’re not done
Oh I just want a love like
Anna
Like Anna
I need a love like Anna
And so I wait for your return
Like a fool who just never learns
I think of you when moonlight fades
Baby I can’t help but to feel this way
And so I wait for your return
Like a fool who just never learns
I think of you when moonlight fades
Baby I can’t help
but to want a love like
Anna
Anna
Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Such spirit through the year
She asked me where I was from
I said Somewhere
you never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville
Headin' by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops
by my Red Wings on the beach
Yeah but now I'm dodging
potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way she
kissed me tells me
she loves Eastern Tennessee
Yeah but all I brought back
with me was some sand in my boots
I said Let's go shoot tequila
So we walked back
to that beach bar
She_said
Don't cowboy's drink whiskey huh
So we drank bottom shelf
She_said
Damn that sky looks perfect
I said Girl you've never seen
stars like the ones back home
And she said
Maybe I should see them
for myself
Yeah but now I'm dodging
potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way she
kissed me tells me
she loves Eastern Tennessee
Yeah but all I brought back
with me was some sand in my boots
I said Meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah but I still thought
that maybe she'd show up
Ah but now I'm dodging potholes
in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way
she kissed me tells me
she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah but all I brought back
with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah but all I brought back
with me was some sand in my boots
You said I know
When I said I need some time
need some space
To think_about all of this
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said
When can I-I-I come_back
And you said that's when
When I wake_up in the morning
That's when
when it's sunny or storming
Laughing when I'm crying
And that's when
I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when when I see your_face
I'll let you in and baby
that's when
Mm mm
I said I know
When you said I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said
Leave those all in our past
And you said
When can I come_back
And I said that's when
When I wake_up in the morning
That's when
when it's sunny or storming
Laughing when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting
at the front gate
That's when I see your_face
I'll let you in and baby
that's when
And you said Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me
And I said
That's when
when I woke_up in the morning
That's when
it was sunny or storming
And laughing when I was crying
And that's when you were
waiting at the front gate
And that's when
when I saw your_face
You let me in and baby
that's when
That's when
when I wake_up in the morning
Yeah
That's when
when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting
at the front gate
That when I miss you
that's when I want you
That's when when I see your_face
That's when I love you
that's when
Killers, won't you come here
and kill some time?
I've_been sentenced to wait here
for hours and days
Till when maybe she will be mine
The lies that you made up
to hide your crime
I could have used some to tell myself
she would come
In a more reassuring tone
The darkness that you carry
inside your hearts
And the freedom it gives
to let die or let live
When your play only has one part
In my play, my part is only one of two
What will happen to me
is not up to me
It depends on what she will choose
Rain that falls upon my window
An infinite circle, drops of the miracle
That brought you into my life
Love is not only what I feel for you
It's the spine and the posture
that's been keeping me upright
Since the day when I fell for you
Sheets between
which I'm trying to sleep
Have the sweetest of smell,
it's of you, I can tell
And that's all I now have of you
It's the blood that heals the wound
You are drivin', amber lights down the road
Yellow lines and the horizon looks cold
Been goin' all night now,
your darkness is goin'
And you've felt your day's been glidin' on
And the year's almost gone
You had something tyin' you down
Now you don't
Mmm-hmm, tarada, tarada
I am off now to get back there to you, mmm
Picture the mornin'
when your door I come through
And you're in bed still,
stirrin' like you were before
Like when I left you, and flew off
And I've_been away for far too long
Stuck in another time zone
I had something tyin' me down
Now I don't
Mmm-hmm, tarada, tarada
Now I don't
Mmm-hmm, tarada, tarada
We used_to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping_through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom
Chasin' that feeling that got gone too_soon
Chasin' that you and me
I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone_new
Still_chasin' you
Still_chasin' you
You always used_to talk_about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used_to know, used_to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom
Chasin' that feeling that got gone too_soon
Chasin' that you and me
I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone_new
Still_chasin' you
Still_chasin' you
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom
Chasin' that feeling that got gone too_soon
Chasin' that you and me
I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone_new
Still_chasin' you
Still_chasin' you
Still_chasin' you
Still_chasin' you
Long handwritten note
deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean
when you're a little too_late
I stood right by the tracks
your_face in a locket
Good girls hopeful they'll be
and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic
love affair
What a sad beautiful
tragic love affair
In dreams
I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds
different cities
And time is taking
its sweet time erasing you
And you've_got your demons
And darling they all look like me
'Cause we had a beautiful
magic lovе there
What a sad beautiful
tragic lovе affair
Distance timing
breakdown fighting
Silence
the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it
could you just try to listen
Hang up give up
and for the life of us
we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic
beautiful tragic beautiful
What we had a beautiful
magic love there
What a sad beautiful
tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic
love there
What a sad beautiful
tragic love affair
I'm walking fast
through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and
our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shadеs of wrong
We learn to live with thе pain
Mosaic broken_hearts
But this love is brave and wild
I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same
This_is a state of grace
This_is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These_are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This_is the golden age of
something good and right and real
And I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same oh
Oh I never
Saw you comin'
And I’ll never
Be the same
This_is a state of grace
This_is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Verse_1
You made up your mind, got off the couch
You did up your hair, now you're goin' out
You put on that party dress
Even_though your heart's a mess
Your friends swung by, you jumped in the car
You walked in here and now here we are
Puttin' the hurtin' on some José
And catchin' up while the band plays
You say you miss the girl you used_to be
Bet I can find her if you let me
Chorus
I can put the smile right back where your smile goes
Dreams back in what you see when your eyes close
I'll be the buzz that you feel when you sip slow
Slow dancе right back in your dirt_road
I can put the sun right back in your sunshine
Bring a little lovе back into your late night
Ain't gotta be nothin' more_than one_more drink
And maybe I can take the blue out of your brown_eyes, baby
Verse_2
And that wild side that you learned to tame
She'll roll in like a midnight train
Almost like she never left here
And I'll be ready, baby, when she gets here
Chorus
I can put the smile right back where your smile goes
Dreams back in what you see when your eyes close
I'll be the buzz that you feel when you sip slow
Slow dance right back in your dirt_road
I can put the sun right back in your sunshine
Bring a little love back into your late night
Ain't gotta be nothin' more_than one_more drink
And maybe I can take the blue out of your brown_eyes, baby Woo
Mm, mm-mm
Oh yeah
Bridge
Put the full back in your half empty
And put the two in your step again
About to see where leanin' in gets me
Baby, just say when
Chorus
'Cause I can put the smile right back where your smile goes
Dreams back in what you see when your eyes close
I'll be the buzz that you feel when you sip slow
Slow dance right back in your dirt_road
I can put the sun right back in your sunshine
Bring a little love back into your late night
Ain't gotta be nothin' more_than one_more drink
And maybe I can take the blue out of your brown_eyes, baby
Mm
Take the blue out of your brown_eyes, baby
Oh,_oh, oh, hey
Outro
Oh, yeah
I'll take the blue
Take the blue out of your brown_eyes, baby
Take the blue
I'll take the blue right out of your brown_eyes, baby
See the gold up in the hills?
It's got nothing to do with us
And eventually,
it'll rust (Mhm-mhm)
It might look beautiful set
in stone
Or, the world will stand in still
Standin' still for the two of us
Well, if you wanna hear,
"I_love you"
Then I'll tell you
one_more time, mhm
Want it to be simple
Don't want it
to be paradise (Yeah)
I'm not askin' for forever
Just give me one_more night
with you
And I'm set for life
Ooh, I'm set for life
Well, I got it bad,
but, that's on you
Like an ocean inside my head
You're just too_much
of a mess (Mhm)
And I like it here, I say,
"I don't know"
Thеre's nothin' to brag about
But, it's a room
with a million yous
And if you wanna hear,
"I_love you"
Thеn I'll tell you
one_more time, mhm
Want it to be simple
Don't want it to be paradise
(Yeah)
I'm not askin' for forever
Just give me one_more night
with you
And I'm set for life
Ooh, I'm set for life
And if you wanna hear,
"I_love you"
Then I'll tell you
one_more time, mhm
Want it to be simple
Don't want it to be paradise
(Yeah)
I'm not askin' for forever
Just give me one_more night
with you
And I'm set for life
Mhm, I'm set for life
I’m tired
And broken
But i was
Still hoping
That i’d finally
Catch my break
Found jesus
Not really
But they say that could heal this
Empty feeling
In my chest
I thought I
Was running out of luck
But my lucks been pretty great
The past_few weeks
Have really felt_like a lot
My bitter feelings
Leaving space for some change
It’s not likely
To happen
These dreams that i’ve been chasing
Since i was a
Little kid
Was useless
In highschool
Smoked too_much pot
To do much
Useful activity
But i’m growing up now
You’ll see
I thought I
Was running out of luck
But my lucks been pretty great
The past_few weeks
Have really felt_like a lot
My bitter feelings
Leaving space for some change
I’m tired
Not useless
I’ve grown_up
But truth is
I’m lying
When i say
I’m not afraid
I’m tired
Not useless
I’ve grown_up
But truth is
I’m lying
When i say
I’m not afraid
I thought I
Was running out of luck
But my lucks been pretty great
The past_few weeks
Have really felt_like a lot
My bitter feelings
Leaving space for some change
I thought I
Was running out of luck
But my lucks been pretty great
The past_few weeks
Have really felt_like a lot
My bitter feelings
Leaving space for some change
These better feelings
Leaving space for some change
Down in the willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we set there a courtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below
I drew a saber through her
It_was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sight
My_father oft had told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly
My_father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly
If I imagine myself peaceful
On the fire escape
Head first, my hands inside my
T-shirt, as we run_away
So now we have a running start
My body moves in mystic ways
I cross my arms to shield my heart
As everything turns into waves
I see the light upon the lake
The silver moon, the water snake
A_pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish
If I align myself with Pisces
In a funny way
Can you, my lover, kiss my bracelet
And my shoulder blades
We’ve always had a running start
I jump between the trampolines
You throw your arms_around my heart
As if to say you’re all I need
The winter pines, the lonely drake
The light beneath the frozen lake
A_pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
and Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance
feeling on New_York time
Back when you fit my poems
like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster_than
a green light go
Hey you skip the conversation
when you already_know
I left a note on the door
with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl
in a brand_new dress
We had this big wide city
all to ourselves
We blocked the noise
with the sound of
I need you
And for the first_time
I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart
in the usual way
And the story's got dust
on every page
But sometimes
I wonder how you
think_about it now
And I see your_face in every crowd
'Cause darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've_been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
It_was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've_been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
I made you laugh, I made you cry
I made you open up your eyes, didn't I
I helped you open up your wings
Your legs, and many other things, didn't I
Am I the greatest bastard that you know
The only one who let you go
Or the one you hurt so_much you cannot bear
We were good when we were good
When we were not misunderstood
You helped me love, you helped me live
You helped me learn how to forgive, didn't you
I wish that I could say the same
But when you left, you left the blame, didn't you
Am I the greatest bastard that you met
The only one you can't forget
Am I the one your truth's been waiting_for
Or am I just dreaming once again
Some dreams are better when they end
Some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some ret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down
We learned to wag and tuck our tails
We learned to win and then to fail, didn't we
We learned that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling, didn't we
Am I the greatest bastard that you know
When will we learn to let this go
We fought so_much we've broken all the charm
But letting_go is not the same as pushing someone_else away
So please don't let on you don't know me
Please_don't let on I'm not here
Please_don't let on you don't love me, cause I know you do
I know
That some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
But I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
But I never meant to let you down
I never meant to let you
I never meant to let you down
I never meant
Yeah, something of a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really I shouldn't be
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, but one_more call
It's the one_more “What'cha doing right now?”
It's the one_more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's the one_more here we go again
[Chorus]
One_more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each_other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one_more time is not enough
One_last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer
[Verse_2]
So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone, then I'm picking up the phone
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, it's the one_more call
It's the one_more “What'cha doing right now?”
It's the one_more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's the one_more here we go again
[Chorus]
One_more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each_other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one_more time is not enough
One_last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer
Yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, one_more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each_other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one_more time is not enough
One_last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer
Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer
Mmm-hmm, oh
Once_upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold_onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me
you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please_tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare_at the phone
he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always
Oh_oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here and it_rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that
cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
but I don't anymore
And I stare_at the phone
he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always
Oh_oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here and it_rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby
I don't think so oh
Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
'Cause it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here and it_rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always
Oh I stare_at the phone
he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
when we said forever and always
And it_rains in your_bedroom
Everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here and it_rains
when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby
You said Forever and always yeah
Springtime in the country
Each time I'm shocked by the light
The world lyin' fallow and you are apart from me
Everythin' in my vision is movement and life
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower and barley
Springtime in the country
I can smell summer on its breath
Low and harrowed lie the fields and the heart of me
Everythin' in my vision, departure, and death
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower, and barley
(The healers) This_year,
I swear it will be buried in actions (Are healin')
This_year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface,
some close to the casket
I feel as useful as dirt, put my body to work
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)
Springtime in the city
The canal banks are empty again
The grass cryin' out to be heated by bodies
The streets for the laughter of young women and men
Canal boat and trolley, wildflower and barley
(The healers) This_year,
I swear it will be buried in actions (Are healin')
This_year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface,
some close to the casket
I feel as useful as dirt, unreal unearth
(The healers) This_year,
I swear it will be buried in actions (Are healin')
This_year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
I feel as useful as dirt, put my body to work
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)
Springtime from my window
Another month has not much longer now
The sun hesitates more on each evening's darkenin'
Would all things God allows remain above ground
Like grief and sweet memory, wildflower and barley
WELCOME TO MY WORLD
WON'T YOU COME ON IN
MIRACLES I GUESS
STILL HAPPEN NOW AND THEN
STEP INTO MY HEART
LEAVE YOUR CARES BEHIND
WELCOME TO MY WORLD
BUILT WITH YOU IN MIND
KNOCK AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN
SEEK AND YOU WILL FIND
ASK AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN
THE KEY TO THIS WORLD OF MINE
I'LL BE WAITING HERE
WITH MY ARMS UNFURLED
WAITING JUST FOR YOU
WELCOME TO MY WORLD
I can feel your body
When I'm lying in my bed
too_much confusion
Going around through my head
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over
When will I ever learn
Old_love
leave me alone
Old_love
just go on home
I can see your_face
But I know that
it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used_to feel
And it makes me so angry
I know that the
flame will always burn
flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that
I'll never learn
Old_love
Old_love
leave me alone
Old_love
just go on home
Old_love
just go on home on home
Old_love
Old_love
Old_love
Old_love
Old_love
Old_love
Old_love
I was on top of the world living high
It_was right in my pocket
I was living the life
Things were just the way they should be
When from out of the sky like a bomb
Comes some little punk in a rocket
Now all of a sudden
Some strange things are_happening to me
I had friends
I had lots of friends
Now all my friends are gone
And i'm doing the best i can to carry on
I had power
I was respected
But not anymore
And i've lost the love
Of the one who i adore
Let me tell you about it
Strange_things are_happening to me
Strange_things
Strange_things are_happening to me
Ain't_no doubt about it
You got someone you think you know well
Who turns out a stranger
The minute you turn your back
You're in it all by yourself
They laugh of your jokes
You think you're_doing quite well
But you're in danger boy
You end up alone forgotten
Way up on the shelf
Strange_things are_happening to me
Strange_things
Strange_things are_happening to me
Ain't_no doubt about it
Strange_things are_happening to me
Strange_things
Strange_things are_happening to me
Strange_things
Looks_like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We might a took the long way
We knew we'd get
there someday They said
i bet they'll never make it
But just look_at us holding on
We're still together
still going strong
you're still the one
You're_still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're_still the one I want
for life
you're still the one
You're_still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're_still the one I kiss
good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look_at what we would be missin
They said
i bet they'll never make it
But just look_at us holding on
We're still together
still going strong
you're still the one
You're_still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're_still the one I want
for life
you're still the one
You're_still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're_still the one I kiss
good night
you're still the one
you're still the one
You're_still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're_still the one I want
for life
you're still the one
You're_still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're_still the one I kiss
good night
I'm so_glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
Walking up the hill tonight
and you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
all those mistakes and be wise
But please try to be patient
and know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to
see the strength inside of me burning
Where are you my angel
now don't you see me crying
And I know that you can't do it all
but you can't say I'm not trying
I'm on my knees in front_of him
but he doesn't seem to see me
But all his troubles on his mind
he's looking right for me
And I'm letting myself down in satisfying you
And I wish that you could see I have my troubles too
Looking at your sleeping
I'm with the man I know
I'm sitting here weeping
while the hours pass so slow
And I know that in the morning
I have to let you go
And you be just a man once I used_to know
And for these past_few days
someone I don't recognise
This isn't all my fault hurt when you realise
Looking at your leaving
I'm looking_for a sign
Why, why so quiet?
Oh my, mysterious country singer? she asked.
My life, it`s a riot
I`m climbing barricades
in empty streets at night.
When I`m down
fighting shadows.
Twenty-five postcards
in a box in my room.
Telephone conversations,
gas slowly leaking out
of a heart-shaped balloon.
It`s a dangerous game
that I`m not sure
if I could keep playing for long.
It`s a dangerous game,
it`s a very fine line
and if one step is wrong...
I have no cards to play
and that`s why
I`ve got nothing to say,
tonight.
I`ve got nothing to say,
tonight.
I only know not everyone sees
Something there beyond the breeze
A lioness stare blond wavy hair
Beautiful so hard not to care
Every move I make
gets closer to you
Reach your hand out
Should I grab or should I go
I'm feeling so weightless
I don't know what
I don't know how
I ended up in this cloud
I'm feeling so helpless
I don't know when
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get down
I got a question
can I stay for a while
I'm liking it here
but am I on file
I just want to talk
but you seem so far
Fading away just like a star
Before you could answer
You've drifted_away
Left me here alone
but right_now I'm feeling ok
I'm feeling so weightless
I don't know what
I don't know how
I ended up in this cloud
I'm feeling so helpless
I don't know when
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get down
Before I know it
I can't_help but wonder
My friends are waiting_for me
but if I could just stay_here
So caught_up in bliss
where is my answer
I'm feeling so weightless
I don't know what
I don't know how
I ended up in this cloud
I'm feeling so helpless
I don't know when
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get down
Feelin so weightless
Feelin so weightless
There I was again tonight
forcing laughter
faking_smiles Same_old tired
lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when I saw your_face
All I can say is it was
enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered
have we met
Across the room your silhouette
starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was
enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
I was_enchanted to meet you
The lingering queestion
kept me up
2AM who do you love
I wonder to I'm right awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It_was enchanting to met you
All I know is I was
enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
This night is flawless
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
I was_enchanted to meet you
This_is me praying that
this was the very_first page
Not where the story line ends
My_thoughts will echo your name
until I see you again
These_are the words
I held back as I was
leaving too_soon
I was_enchanted to meet you
Please_don't be in love
with someone_else
Please_don't have somebody
waiting on you
Please_don't be in love
with someone_else
Please_don't have somebody
waiting on you
This night is sparkling
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
This night is flawless
don't you let it go
I'm_wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
I'll spend_forever wondering
if you knew
I was_enchanted to meet you
Please_don't be in love
with someone_else
Please_don't have somebody
waiting on you

As I awoke I found out he had gone
For no reason at all
First came the rose
And then the thorn
And now he's gone
April was blooming all around
All I saw is he had gone
April has seen our rise and fall
And now he's gone
Pity me
when the evening shadows fall
Forgive me for what I've_done
For I've kept the taste
of a love that's gone
The rose and the thorn
April was blooming all around
All I saw is he had gone
April has seen our rise and fall
And now he's gone
Oh he is gone in the wind blow my hair
with thorn in my heart
I will learn to go on
He is gone in the wind bite my cheeks
with thorn in my heart
I will learn to go on
All I hear is raindrops
falling on the rooftop
oh baby tell me why'd
you have to go
'Cause this pain I feel
it won't go away
And today I'm officially
missing you
I thought that from this
heartache I could
escape
But I've fronted long
enough to know
There_ain't no way
And today I'm officially
missing you
Ooh can't nobody
do it like you
Said every little
thing you do
hey baby
Said it stays on
my mind
And I I'm officially
All I do is lay around
two years full_of tears
From looking at your
face on the wall
Just a week ago
you were my baby
Now I don't even
know you at all
I don't know you at all
Well I wish that you
would call me
right_now
So that I could
get through to
you somehow
But I guess it's
safe to say baby
safe to say
That I I'm officially
missing you
ooh can't nobody
do it like you
Said every little
thing you do
hey baby
Said it stays
on my mind
And I I'm officially
Well I thought
I could just get
over you baby
But I see that's
something I just
can't do
From the way ou
would hold me
To the sweet
things you told me
I just can't find a
way to let go of you
Ooh can't nobody
do it like you
Said every little
thing you do
hey baby
Said it stays
on my mind
And I I'm officially
It's official
Hoo you know
that I'm missin'you
yeah yes
All I hear is
raindrops oh yeah
And I I'm officially
missin' you
Woke up today
jumped out of bed
Feeling kinda great
cos you're on my head
Regrets and mistakes
put it behind us instead
Back to the old days
when we knew what lay ahead
And I was wondering
if I was on your mind
but I'm so out of line
I'll just get declined
Cos you're happier this time
without me in your life mmmm
I remember how we used_to be
I remember when you loved me
I remember
when you made me cups of tea
and I remember how scared you were
when you met my family
And I remember
when I used_to make you smile
I remember when you
used_to come around
I remember every_time
I had a frown
you'd hold me
until the stars came out
and the sun went down
I'm not saying
we can last forever
I just think
we could be much better
If you disagree then
honey go get her
Don't bother writing
an apologetic letter cos'
Darlin' Darlin' I won't reply
You're so out of line
and you'll just get declined
Cos I'm happier this time
without you in my life uh_uh
I remember how we used_to be
I remember when you loved me
I remember
when you made me cups of tea
and I remember how scared
you were when you met my family
And I remember
when I used_to make you smile
I remember when you
used_to come around
I remember every_time
I had a frown you'd hold me
until the stars came out
and the sun went down
Down down down down down
I remember how we used_to be
I remember how we used_to be
Down down down down down
I I remember every_time
I had a frown you'd hold me ahhhh
I remember how we used_to be
I remember when you loved me
I remember
when you made me cups of tea
and I remember how scared

And I remember

I remember when you
used_to come around
I remember every_time

No No No
This_is perfect
Come kiss me one_more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even_if I tried
You and me in this_moment
Feels_like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be
Everybody's talking about heaven
like they just can't_wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good
so beautiful
Lying next to you
in this bed with you
I ain't convinced
Cause I don't know how
I don't know how heaven heaven
Could be better_than this
I swear you're and angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you girl
I could stay_here forever
I'd be fine if we never
had to even leave this room
Everybody's talking about heaven
like they just can't_wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good
so beautiful
Lying next to you
in this bed with you
I ain't convinced
Cause I don't know how
I don't know how heaven heaven
Could be better_than this
Could be better_than this
Everybody's talking about heaven

Saying how it's gonna be so good

I ain't convinced
Cause I don't know how
I don't know how heaven heaven
Could be better_than this heaven
Could be better_than this heaven
heaven
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one_more time
The flickering TV
Our days are sloped and steep
But we get by
Climbing up like soldiers
Our phone calls late at night
They glow like candle light
They’re warm like double duvets
on our shoulders
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t_forget to wave
Your tracks in snow As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t_forget to wave to me
We steamed the windows up
Let iron patience rust
We’re gonna have
to throw ourselves outside
And when the blizzard comes
Let our feet go numb
We’ll be treading lightly
for a long time
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t_forget to wave
Your tracks in snow As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t_forget to wave to me
The snapshots fizzle out
Two was such a crowd
I bet your voice is different
since I saw you Though
the ice melts grey
Summer’s on its way
I’m brave enough to crawl out
from my igloo
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t_forget to wave
Your tracks in snow
As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t_forget to wave to me
When you leave I can breathe
Clear my chest
But don’t_forget to wave
Your tracks in snow
As you go
Winter’s cold
But don’t_forget to wave to me
How blessed we are to be in
this_moment that we’re in
In all eternity
right_now has never been
With every breath
we enter into a holy mystery
and maybe in this_moment now
is all we’ll ever need
How blessed we are to be in
this_moment that we’re in
In all eternity
right_now has never been
With every breath
we enter into a holy mystery
and maybe in this_moment now
is all we’ll ever need
Right outside of this one
church town
There's a gold dirt_road
to a whole_lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land
but it ain't my ground
This_is God's_country
We pray for rain
and thank it when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain
and a little_bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess_that's why they call it
God's_country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40
on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy
water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound
of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind
that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia
but he didn't stick_around
This_is God's_country
We turned the dirt and worked
until the week's done
We take a break and break
bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be
from God's_country Yeah_yeah
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40
on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in
holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound
of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind
that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia
but he didn't stick_around
This_is God's_country Yeah
This_is God's_country
God's_country
I don't_care
what my headstone reads
Or what kind_of pine wood box
I end up in
When it's my time
lay me six feet deep
In God's_country Yeah_yeah
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40
on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in
holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound
of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind
that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia
but he didn't stick_around
This_is God's_country God's_country
Yeah I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40
on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in
holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound
of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind
that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia
but he didn't stick_around
This_is God's_country
Yesterday you told me
that you wanna be alone
I could hear the distance
in your voice over the phone
You don't say I love you back
Or let your feelings show
You used_to be so good at that
But now I never know
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me
how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Midnight drives in your old
sweatshirts never felt so cold
And I still hear the stupid
songs you showed me
everywhere I go
I can taste the hesitation
running from your_lips
I can feel it in my bones
they're breaking
We can't end like this
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me
how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Moments wrapped and romance
That end with bitter sunrises
and goodbyes
Moments so fragile and rare
That I wonder
if it would have the same taste
If not such a delicacy
But I'd still devour you
As I lay here and recall years
of wavering emotions
Suppressed desires
and volcanic explosions
That retreat into dormancy
I wonder could
we ever flow together
Or are we two twin souls
Finding each_other
in the wrong lifetime
'Cause maybe I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go
If I really love you
I'll let you go
Hmm yeah_yeah yeah
Maybe it's intuition
But some things
you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I found my best_friend
I know that it might sound
More_than a little crazy
but I believe
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
There's just no rhyme or reason
Only the sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home
I know that it might sound
More_than a little crazy
but I believe
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you
before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
yeah_yeah
Oh I knew I loved you
before I met you
I knew I loved you
before I met you yeah_yeah
In the heat of the fight
I walked away
Ignorin' words
that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said This time
I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little_closer
I said Leave
but all I really want is you
To stand outside
my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin' I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pourin' rain
comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other_side
of the door
Me and my stupid
pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs
starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things
we_both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
Oh babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left I wanted you
to chase after me yeah
I said Leave
but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window
throwin' pebbles
Screamin' I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pourin' rain
comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other_side
of the door
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look_at you
I don't need you
but I do I do I do
I say There's_nothing
you can say
To make this right again
I mean it I mean it
But what I mean is
I said Leave but baby
all I want is you
To stand outside my window
throwin' pebbles
Screamin' I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pourin' rain
comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other_side
of the door
With your_face
and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation
with the little white lies
And the faded picture
of a beautiful night
You carried me
from your car up the stairs
And I broke_down crying
was she worth this mess
After everything
and that little black_dress
After everything I must confess
I need you
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything
I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight."
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss_screaming
and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2_AM and I'm_cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kind_of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he_calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss_screaming
and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2_AM and I'm_cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kind_of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's_not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss_screaming
and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2_AM and I'm_cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kind_of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh,_oh
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way
I loved you oh,_oh, oh,_oh
Oh,_oh, oh, whoa
Never_knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
I lost count how many_times I've tumbled round inside your washing machine
Hung myself out to dry, to regain some of my self-esteem
Are you just a spoiled girl who's never had to make up her mind?
Am I just a fool to think that you could ever be mine?
Go and find_somebody else (go and find_somebody else)
Go and find_somebody else (go and find_somebody else)
It's true I'm more wise now than I was when I was twenty-one
It's true I've less time now than I had when I was twenty-one
I feel so vulnerable when you are not around
You have so_much power over me
Go and find_somebody else (go and find_somebody else)
Go and find_somebody else (go and find_somebody else)
Even If I was
Carelessly killed
I won’t go back to hate
Back in the past
I’d see red in my eyes
I’d never forget or forgave
Oh how do we love ourselves
If we’re tearing each_other down?
How do we love somebody_else
If the cost is the pain of
yourself? Oh, oh
If only a few, hear the message
I sing
At_least I still played my part
‘Cause what is the point, of
being a star
If you can’t even guidе
someone home
But how do wе love ourselves
If we’re tearing each_other down
How do we love somebody_else
If the cost is the pain of myself?
Oh-oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah (Yeah)
I get a feeling that I never, never, never
Never had before, no, no (Yeah)
I just wanna tell you right_now that I (Ooh)
I believe, I really do believe that
[Chorus]
Something’s got a hold on me, yeah
(Oh, it must be love)
Oh, something’s got a hold on me right now, child
(Oh, it must be love)
Let me tell you now
[Verse_1]
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand_new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
[Pre-Chorus]
I said, oh_(oh), oh_(oh), oh_(oh), oh (oh)
Hey, oh,_oh, it must be love
(You know it must be love)
Let me tell you now
[Chorus]
Something’s got a hold on me, yeah
(Oh, it must be love)
Oh, something’s got a hold on me right now, child
(Oh, it must be love)
Let me tell you now
[Verse_2]
I never felt_like this before
Something’s got a hold on me that won’t let go
I believe I’d die if I only could
I feel strange, but it sure feels good
[Chorus]
I said, oh_(oh), oh_(oh), oh (oh)
Hey hey, oh, it must be love
(You know it must be love)
Let me tell you now
[Bridge]
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt_like this before
Something’s got a hold on me that won’t let go
I never thought it could happen to me
Got me heavy without the misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love’s sure gonna put a hurting on me
[Pre-Chorus]
I said, oh_(oh), oh_(oh), oh_(oh), oh (oh)
Hey hey, yeah, it must be love
[Chorus]
(You know it must be love)
You know he walks like love
(You know he walks like love)
You know he talks like love
(You know he talks like love)
Makes me feel alright
(Makes me feel alright)
In the middle_of the night
(In the middle_of the night)
La, la,_la, la (La, la,_la, la)
La, la,_la, la (La, la,_la, la)
I hate the winter
can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans
(So sorry I can't make it)
But when the heat comes
something takes a hold
Can I kick it Yeah I can
My cheeks in high colour
overripe peaches
No shirt no shoes
only my features
My boy behind me
he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls
onto the beaches
Come one come all
I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus
Forget all of thе tears
that you've cried
It's ovеr (Over over over over)
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming my baby
Acid green aquamarine
The girls are dancing in the sand
And I throw my cellular device
in the water
Can you reach me No you can't (Aha)
My cheeks in high colour
overripe peaches
No shirt no shoes
only my features
My boy behind me
he's taking pictures
(He's taking pictures)
Lead the boys and girls
onto the beaches
Come one come all
I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus
Turn it on in a new kind_of bright
It's solar (Solar solar solar solar)
Come on and let the bliss begin
Blink three times
when you feel it kicking in
That solar olar_olar power
Solar olar_olar power
Solar olar_olar power
Solar olar_olar power
Solar olar_olar power
Solar olar_olar power
I don't need you to sell me
on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search
for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared
you're not enough
'Cause what
we've got going is good
I don't need more reminders
of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix
what I'd_rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noise
that's in your head
We can't compete_with all that
So what if it's us
what if it's us
And only us
And what came_before
won't count anymore
or matter
Can we try that
What if it's you
what if it's me
what if that's all
that we needed to bе
And the rest
of the world fliеs away
What do you say
I ain't never thought
there'll_be someone
like you who would want me
So I'll give you ten_thousand
reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me
and nothing_else
Well that's all
that I've wanted for longer
than you could possibly know
So it can be us it can be us
And only us
And what came_before
won't count anymore
or matter
We can try that
It's not so impossible
Nobody_else but the two of us here
'Cause you're saying it's possible
We can just watch
the whole_world disappear
'Til you're the only one
I still know how to see
It's just you and me
It'll be us
it'll be us and only us
And what came_before
won't count anymore
We can try that you and me
That's all that we needed to be
And the rest
of the world falls away
And the rest
of the world falls away
ayy_ayy ayy
The world falls away
the world falls away
the world falls away
the world falls away
And it's only us
Hey, you’re good at making me lose my mind
But I always come_around, don’t I?
And I know sometimes I’m bringin’ you down
But I always make you smile, don’t I?
Mmm
We’re like the waves on a big blue stormy sea
But still you're the one who brings the best out in me
We’re a little messed_up baby
Kinda up and down
And we keep falling 'til we hit the ground
But then we, ooh
We get back up again
Yeah we’re a little messed_up baby
It’s never getting boring
When we keep aiming for the stars
Just you and me, ooh
We always get back up again
You and me
Ooh, baby you and me
There_is no_one else who can make me feel like
I can do_anything I dream of but you
We can fight all day and make love at night
‘Cause we always figure it out, don't we, yeah
We’re like the waves on a big blue stormy sea
We’re a little messed_up baby
Kinda up and down
And we keep falling 'til we hit the ground
But then we, ooh
We get back up again
Yeah we’re a little messed_up baby
It’s never getting boring
When we keep aiming for the stars
Just you and me, ooh
We always get back up again
You and me
You and me
Baby, you and me
(Ooh)
You always leave me wanting_more
Baby, you and me we’re like the perfect storm
And you know that I can't get_enough of you, no

I know nothing_stays the same
If you're willing to play the game

Paradise is a swing on a porch
Summertime is a little too_short
The best things in life are free
And they're always gonna be
Hometown is a heaven on earth
Sundays are for football and church
The world_turns but I believe
There's always gonna be
Beer drinkin' kids on a backroad
Good_country songs on the radio
Tailgates fallin' down on a Friday
Long_goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long_as the sun keeps comin'_up
Long_as the Mississippi_River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
Girl, your eyes are my favorite blue
I double-take when I wake_up with you
I'm so in love with you lovin' on me
And I'm always gonna be
Holding you close for the rest_of my life
Forever and ever, baby, just like
Beer drinkin' kids on a backroad
Good_country songs on the radio
Tailgates fallin' down on a Friday
Long_goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long_as the sun keeps comin'_up
Long_as the Mississippi_River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
Always gonna hold your hand
Always gonna ask you to dance
Even when we're pushin' eighty
You're_still gonna drive me crazy
There's always gonna be
Beer drinkin' kids on a backroad
Good_country songs on the radio
Tailgates fallin' down on a Friday
Long_goodbye kisses in the driveway
Long_as the sun keeps comin'_up
Long_as the Mississippi_River runs
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
(Some things are always gonna be)
(Some things are always gonna be)
(Some things are always gonna be)
Baby, just like you and me
Some_things are always gonna be
In my head
Thoughts they weigh like lead
I can see the end
Don’t pretend to comprehend this
Bright whirlwind lights and white tour vans
Balance on the edge of the borderline
I would let you in but I know
You’ll never understand so why even try
You’re wishing that your life would be like mine
I keep on moving up while you fall behind
In the shadow of the spotlight
In every song
My words on your tongue
Everything I’ve done to throw you a lifeline
You’re where I was before the big tour bus
Miles from the ledge of the borderline
I would let you in but I know
You’ll never understand so why even try
You’re wishing that your life would be like mine
I keep on moving up while you fall behind
In the shadow of the spotlight
When you’re next to me all I see are empty spaces
It’s a one way street but you don’t even sing my praises
You’ll never understand so why even try
You’re wishing that your life would be like mine
I keep on moving up while you fall behind
In the shadow of the spotlight
In the shadow of the spotlight
In the shadow of the spotlight
In the shadow of the spotlight
You’ll never understand so why even try
I bet this time of night
you’re still up
I bet_you’re tired
from a long hard week
I bet_you’re sitting in your chair
by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes
you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes_everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every_time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
I bet you think
I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out
there’s no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you
That I can’t say_hello to you
And risk another goodbye
And I just want to tell you
It takes_everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every_time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
Oh we made quite a mess babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess babe
In my dreams
you’re touching my face
And asking me
if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes_everything in me
not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every_time I don’t
I almost do I almost do
I bet this time of night
you’re still up
I bet_you’re tired
from a long hard week
I bet_you’re sitting in your chair
by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes
you wonder about me
Don't give me
something to hold in my hand
Something else to believe in
Cause I'm over it
And your reasons for wanting to stay
Your reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything are dull to you
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box I'm living with
I could go wild
but you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
but god forbid then you might envy me
So don't give me
love with an_old book of rules
That kind_of love's just for fools
And I'm over it
My reasons for walking away
My reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything are lost with you
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box I'm living with
I could go wild
but you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
but god forbid then you might envy me
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box you call a gift
I could go wild
but you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
but god forbid then you might envy me
I could be wild and free
Well god forbid then you might
Rest your head
Over mine
I have faith in our love
Wash my mouth
Empty out
All the dirt that you found
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no_one but you
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no_one but you
Dust me off
Fix me up
I don't want
What I was
And lock it up
Keep it there
It's no good
And nowhere
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no_one but you
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no_one but you
And don't you take
my heart and break it
Be my friend
There_is no other way to say it
'Cause you got me again
Don't you take
my heart and break it
Be my friend
There_is no other way to say it
'Cause you got me again
'Cause you got me again
Rest your head
Over mine
I have faith in our love
Morning_has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has_spoken
Like the first spring
Praise_for the singing
Praise_for the morning
Praise_for them springing
Fresh from the world
Sweet the rains new fall
Sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall
On the first grass
Preaise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where his feet pass
Mine is the sunlight
Mine is the morning
Born of the one light
Eden saw play
Praise with elation
Praise every morning
God's recreation
of the new day
Morning_has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has_spoken
Like the first spring
Praise_for the singing
Praise_for the morning
Praise_for them springing
Fresh from the world
Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
Ay,_Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this_waltz, take this_waltz
Take this_waltz with the clamp on its jaws
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallways where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled_with footsteps and sand
Ay,_Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this_waltz, take this_waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this_waltz, this_waltz, this_waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
Ay,_Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this_waltz, take this_waltz
Take this_waltz it's been dying for years
There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow
Ay,_Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this_waltz, take this_waltz
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!"
This waltz, this_waltz, this_waltz, this_waltz ...
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, Oh my love
Take this_waltz, take this_waltz
It's yours now. It's all that there is
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo,
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo.
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal,
come bibble in the boo shy Lorey.
Here I sit on Buttermilk Hill;
who could blame me, cry my fill;
Every tear would turn a mill,
Johnny's gone for a soldier.
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo,
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo.
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal,
come bibble in the boo shy Lorey.
I sold my flax, I sold my wheel,
to buy my love a sword of steel;
So it in battle he might wield,
Johnny's gone for a soldier.
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo,
Oh my baby, oh, my love,
gone the rainbow, gone the dove.
Your father was my only love;
Johnny's gone for a soldier.
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo,
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo.
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal,
come bibble in the boo shy Lorey.
When I was just a lad of ten,
my father said to me,
"Come here and take a lesson
from the lovely lemon tree."
Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.
Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.
One day, beneath the lemon tree,
my love and I did lie,
A girl so sweet, that when she smiled,
the stars rose in the sky.
We passed that summer lost in love
beneath the lemon tree,
The music of her laughter
hid my father's words from me.
Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.
Lemon tree, very pretty,
and the lemon flower is sweet,
But the fruit of the poor lemon
is impossible to eat.
One_day she left without a word,
she took away the sun.
And in the dark she'd left behind,
I knew what she had done.
She'd left me for another,
it's a common tale but true.
A sadder man, but wiser now,
I sing these_words to you
Lemon tree Lemon tree
Lemon tree Lemon tree -
Try to remember the kind_of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind_of September
When grass was green And grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind_of September
When you were a tender And callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow,_follow
Try to remember When life was so_tender
That no_one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so_tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember the kind_of September
When love was an ember About to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow,_follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
Although you know The snow will follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
Without the hurt the heart is hollow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September That made us mellow
Deep in December Our hearts should remember
then follow, follow,_follow -
Sitting here on this lonely dock
Watch the rain play
on the ocean top
All the things I feel
I need to say
I can't explain in any_other way
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow_older
with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah I'd_rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
Now here's the sun
come to dry the rain
Warm my shoulders and
relieve my pain
You're the one_thing
that I'm missing here
With you beside me
I no longer fear
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow_older
with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah I'd_rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
I could have saved
so_much time for us
Had I seen the way to
get to where I am today
You waited on me for so long
So now listen to me say
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow_older
with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah I'd_rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
Say you feel the way I do
We were both_young
when I first_saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing_there
On a balcony of summer air
See the lights See the party
the ball gowns I see you make
your way through the crowd
You say_hello Little did I know
That you were_Romeo
you were throwing_pebbles
And my daddy_said stay away
from_Juliet And I was crying
on the staircase Begging you
please don't go and i said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
So I sneak out to the garden to
see you We keep quiet cause
we're dead if they know
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were_Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy_said stay away
from_Juliet But you were
everything to me I was begging you
please don't go and I said
Romeo_take me somewhere
we can be alone I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
Romeo_save me they try to tell me
how to feel This love is difficult
but it's real Don't be afraid
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
I got tired_of waiting
Wondering if you were
ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts
of town I said Romeo_save me
I've_been feeling so alone
I keep waiting_for you
but you never come
Is this in my head
i don't know what to think
He knealt to the ground
and pulled out a ring And said
Marry me Juliet you'll_never
have to be alone I love you
and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go
pick out a white_dress
It's a love story_baby just say_yes
Cause we were both_young
when I first_saw you
Forgive me Hera
I cannot stay.
He cut out my tongue,
there is nothing to say.
Love me oh Lord, he threw me away,
he laughed at my sins,
in his arms i must stay.
He wrote, I'm broke.
Please send for me.
But I'm broken too, and spoken for.
Do not, tempt me.
Her skin is white,
and I'm light as the sun,
so holy light shines,
on the things, you have done.
So I asked him,
how he became this man?
How that he learned,
to hold fruit in his hands?
and where is the lamb,
that gave you your name?
He had to leave,
though i begged HIM to stay.
Left me alone, when i needed the light
Fell to me knees and i wept for my life
If he had of stayed,
you might understand.
If he had of stayed,
you never would've taken my hand.
He wrote I'm low.
Please send for me.
but I'm broken too, and spoken for.
Do not, tempt me.
and where is the lamb,
that gave you your name?
He had to flee,
though I begged him to stay.
Begged him to stay,
in my cold wooden grip.
Begged him to stay,
by the light of my ship.
Me fighting him, fighting light,
fighting dawn.
The waves came, and stole him,
and took him toward.
He wrote, I'm broke.
Please send for me.
but I'm broken too, and spoken for.
Do not, tempt me.
Forgive me Hera, I cannot stay.
He cut out my tongue,
there is nothing to say
Love me oh lord, he threw me away.
He laughed at my sins,
in his arms i must stay.
We write.
That's alright.
I miss his smell.
We speak when spoken to.
That suits us well that suits us well.
That suits me well
I spilled the ink
across the page trying
to spell your name
So I fold it up and I flick it out
Paper aeroplane
It wont fly the seven seas to you
Cause it didn't leave my room
But it awaits the hands
of someone_else
The garbage man
Got to say mm_mm mm
Got to say mm_mm mm
So he opens it up
and reads it out to all his
friends
Amongst the crowd a heart will
break and a heart will mend
He walks on home tired from work
The letter falls from his_hand
He reaches out only
to catch the sky
Its gone with the wind
Got to say mm_mm mm
Got to say mm_mm mm
I spilled the ink across the land
Trying to spell your name
Up and down there it goes
Paper aeroplane
It hasn't flown
the seven seas to you
But its on its way
It goes through the hands
Then to someone_else
To find you girl
Got to say mm
Got to say mm
You were in college workin'
part time waitin' tables
Left a small_town
never looked back
I was a flight risk
with a fear of fallin'
Wonderin' why we bother
with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
You remember
we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin'
on the world together
And there's a drawer of my
things at your place
You learn my secrets and
you figure_out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make
my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured_out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is
what I thought about
You remember we were
sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city
lights on the water
You saw me start to believe
for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
And I remember that fight
2 30 am
You said Everything was
slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you
followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by_surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone
You said
I remember how we felt
sittin' by the water
And everytime I look_at you
it's like the first_time
I fell in love with a careless
man's_careful daughter
She is the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
do you believe it
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now
Send The Sun The Trees Ringtone to your Cell
The sun fills the kitchen in my house
it's warm and cosy and it helps me breathe
and I wonder_if you're making people laugh
'cause you're funny you're funny
The trees out of my window dance
oh they do dance with the wind
and I wonder why I wonder why
I wonder why we are apart
'Cause we're funny people beautiful inside
The sun the trees the moon the sea
the clouds above hang over me
The sun the trees the moon the sea
The sea goes quiet when the night is dark
with the lights reflected jump in from the sky
and I wonder_if we'll see the moon walk by
'cause it's shinning it's shinning
as it lights the sadows see the moon walk by
The sun the trees the moon the sea
the clouds above hang over me
The sun the trees the moon the sea
The sun the trees the moon the sea
When you're weary
feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh when times get rough
And friend just can't be found
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh when darkness_comes
And pain is all around
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down
Sail on silver girl
sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll ease your mind
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll ease your mind
I don't mind if you wanna go_anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go_anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go to the Chateau_Marmont
And dance in the hotel_room
We can run with headlights on
'Til we got nothing to lose
We have lifting from the ground
We go never coming down
I don't mind if you wanna go_anywhere
I'll take you there
Everyday the weekend
I'm tryna be your best_friend
Trying just to figure it out
Go on and let your gun burst
Living on the outskirts
Trying just to figure it out
Talking like a deadbeat
I just wanted you to see
Everything that I could see
Walking in the night sky
I'm always on your side
You are really saving me
We can go to the Chateau_Marmont
And dance in the hotel_room
We can go to the Chateau_Marmont
And dance we got nothing to lose
I don't mind if you wanna go_anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go_anywhere
I'll take you there
We had lifting from the ground
We go never coming down
I don't mind if you wanna go_anywhere
I'll take you there
I'll take you there
I'll take you there
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you
don't already_know
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you
don't already_know
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you
don't already_know
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you
don't already_know
Throw me a bone
Don't go_wasting your time
Don't be scared of what you
don't already_know
Throw me a bone
Don't go_wasting your time
Don't be scared of what you
don't already_know
Throw me a bone
Don't go_wasting your time
Don't be scared of what you
don't already_know
Don't go_wasting your time
Don't go_wasting your time
You shake me up
and turn me upside_down
Just like a snow globe
And every_time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight
on a Christmas tree
Every_single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
Outside it's coming down
But here inside it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight
on a Christmas tree
Every_single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
The winter is so gray
feels_like the ice is here to stay
But when you look_at me
you know you melt it all away
Every_single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you
decorate my heart
Oh so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart
Jingle_bell, jingle_bell
Jingle_bell, jingle_bell rock
Jingle_bell, jingle bell,

Jingle_bells chime
in jingle_bell time
Dancin' and prancing
in jingle_bell square
In the frosty air
Jingle, jingle_bell rock
That's the jingle_bell

There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my_brain
It's my first one today
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my_brain
It's-it's my first one today
Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your_mama at church
I'm pretty sure
I saw your car at the mall
I see your_face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's
all my phone wants to call
It's kinda funny_how I can't seem
To get away_from you
It's almost like
you don't want me to
You've_got a cold heart
and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey
but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress
just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight out of mind
Girl you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh you're breakin' my heart
Baby you're playin' hard to forget
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch on the swing
You'll come and grab 'em
by the end of the week
Well it's just some
jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole_lot of hurt
I think I know why you've_been
dragging your feet
Ain't it funny_how I can't seem
To get away_from you
It's almost like
you don't want me to
You've_got a cold heart
and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey
but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress
just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight out of mind
Girl you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine

That you showed up tonight
In that dress
just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight out of mind
Girl you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh you're breakin' my heart
Baby you're playin' hard to forget
Oh honey I'm fallin' apart
And you're playin' hard to forget
Yeah man oh man oh man
Bartender looked_at me like
Pony up man
we're closin' down
I paid the tab
and I turned around
Got on that phone
on the way home
And ended up
down the rabbit hole again
It's funny_how you
haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see
New_York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey what you gon' do
I'm sick of sittin'_at the house
dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere
I can be alone
Try to let you go
somethin' always reminds me
I bet_breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired_of gettin' drunk
tired_of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures
I don't wanna see
Girl you're everywhere
everywhere but behind me
I bet_breakin' up
was easy in the '90s
Back_then
I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called
when I was out
But you didn't know what to say
so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably
at home right_now
sound asleep
'Cause goin' out
isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue
what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls
I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again
I'm sick of sittin'_at the house
dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere
I can be alone
Try to let you go
somethin' always reminds me
I bet_breakin' up
was easy in the '90s
I'm tired_of gettin' drunk
tired_of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures
I don't wanna see
Girl you're everywhere
everywhere but behind me
I bet_breakin' up was easy in the '90s
Modern love
it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of
my generation and I
'Bout had enough
watchin' you gettin' on with your life
Baby I'm sick of sittin'_at the house
dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere
I can be alone
I try to let you go
somethin' always reminds me
I bet_breakin' up
was easy in the '90s
I'm tired_of gettin' drunk
tired_of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures
I don't wanna see
Girl you're everywhere
everywhere but behind me
I bet_breakin' up
was easy in the '90s
Hearts breakin'
I'm a product of my
Oh a product of my generation
oh and I
My baby my baby
Gracious and severe
and lying next to me
When I don't know
if you're sleeping,
but you oughta be
I just wanted to protect you,
with your shaking
hands and no shoes
I just thought that
you might grow to understand
I tap twice on your doorframe
and you let me in
I tap twice on your forehead
and a heart appears
It_seems like you're only high
when you're holding your breath
Only bright
when you're broken in half
When we met a few years back,
you didn't warm to me
And I left oranges in your_bedroom
like an offering
And I see you in the future,
you look just the same, but older
And I wave to you,
but I don't slow my pace
I tap twice on your doorframe
and you let me in
I tap twice on your forehead
and a heart appears
It_seems like you're only high
when you're holding your breath
Only bright
when you're broken in half
And I almost broke my wrists
trying to bring you back
And you thrashed around
like goldfish in a garbage bag
It_seems like you're only high
when you're holding your breath
Only bright
when you're broken in half
Time
Ticking in the back of my mind
'Cause I know what I'll find
If I sit in place
So I walk
Never really sure where I'm going
But it's better_than knowing
What everyday will be
I am who I am
And I know what I know
But I don't know my way
I just go where I go
But I never could forget your_face
It finds me in my sleep
And I'd like to tell you
about those dreams
But talk is always cheap
So I go where I go
That road is gone
Now it just lives in this song
I've_seen all I've_seen
But I sometimes wonder
If you still think of me
I never meant to fade away
It's just the way I'm made
I hope if you ever hear my name
That it doesn't bring you pain
And just know that I know
Yeah just know that I know
That those days were gold
And a heart always holds
Onto missing roads
I don’t remember much
about last_night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living_room
through these bloodshot
eyes of my mine
cold sober
You didn’t like
that I come home late
4am but it’s a Friday babe
And I’ve_been working hard
Can’t you give me some space
steada shoutin out
Oh my God
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me
miss you more
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
And I keep second_guessing
Where_did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve_had one too_many
Come take me home
Now I’m the one that’s crying
I didn’t wanna call
cos I didn’t wanna fight
I swear that I was trying
But everybody falls
when their head’s a little high
And I never meant to get
so out my mind
With you playing cool
just pretending it’s fine
Oh we’ve been
‘round ‘round ‘round this
Too_many times before
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me
miss you more more
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
And I keep second_guessing
Where_did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve_had one too_many
Come take me home
I don’t know how_lucky
how_lucky I am I am I am no
I guess sometimes
I should give more
of a damn a damn a damn
about you
I don’t know how_lucky
how_lucky I am I am I am no
I know we’re_both stubborn
Push each other’s buttons
I’d rather do it with you but
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
I spent all my money
Drinking on my own yeah
In this bar just sat_here
Staring_at my phone
And I keep second_guessing
Where_did I go wrong
I know I’m proud
But I’ve_had one too_many
Come take me home
Come take me home
Yeah I’ve_had one too_many
Verse_1
I took your number out my phone but it didn't even matter
'Cause I know it by heart, yeah
We can't even say, No, let alone let go
'Cause we'd_end up where we are
And I know I said I wouldn't
And you know said you wouldn't too
So how'd we end up here, in the same room
Chorus
It's irresponsible
To be this close after midnight
Irresponsible
To remind myself what your_lips taste like
'Cause I'm still gettin' over the last time, we said it's the last time
But I still, I still
Pick up when you call
Even_though it's irresponsible
Verse_2
I wish I had a good excuse but no matter_what I do
I can't even think of one
Yeah, I know history repeats, I'll be right back in your sheets
When it's all said and done
It's against our better judgement, I know
Even_though we_both want it, it's so, it's so
Chorus
Irresponsible
To be this close after midnight
Irresponsible
To remind myself what your_lips taste like
'Cause I'm still gettin' over the last time, we said it's the last time
But I still, I still
Pick up when you call
Even_though it's irresponsible
Bridge
And I know I said I shouldn't
And you know said you shouldn't too
So how'd we end up here, in the same room
Yeah, ayy, ayy
Chorus
Irresponsible
To be this close after midnight After midnight
Irresponsible
To remind myself what your_lips taste like What your_lips taste like
'Cause I'm still gettin' over the last time, we said it's the last time
But I still, I still
Pick up when you call
Even_though it's irresponsible
Outro
I still pick_up when you call
Even_though it's irresponsible
I still pick_up when you call, yeah
Even_though it's irresponsible
She’s a flower among the weeds,
more beautiful than any rose
I put the creases in her shoes,
she put the crinkle in my nose
I’ll have wrinkles when I’m young,
from all the laughing I suppose
And I’ll hold your heart forever,
long after I propose
Hold her while you can,
cause someday you won’t get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you’ve spent
Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won’t end
So, I’ll hold her while I can, till the one day that I get the chance again
She’s a doll at 83, acting like we_both just met
Reminding me of times,
that I swore I’d not forget
Now I’m 85 years old, alone,
lying on this bed
Missing the sound of her voice and the three words that she once said
Hold her while you can, cause someday you won’t get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you’ve spent
Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won’t end
So, I’ll hold her while I can, till the one day that I get the chance
Hold her while you can, cause someday you won’t get the chance
Cherish every moment and all the time you’ve spent
Cause this life will all be over, but my love for you won’t end
So, I’ll hold her while I can, till the one day that I get the chance
We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've_been thinkin' we need
A little time alone
So what you say we cancel our plans
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're_doing
to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta_have it
Let the passion take us
to a higher place
Makin' the kind_of love we make
There_ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think_about Oh, oh
Besides turn around
and lockin' the door
Watching your red_dress
fall to the floor
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're_doing to me
all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta_have it
Let the passion take us
to a higher place
Makin' the kind_of love we make
Kind of love we make
So what you say we cancel our plans
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man
Let's get some candles burning
Some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're_doing to me
all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta_have it
Let the passion take us
to a higher place
Girl, I want it, gotta_have it
Let the passion take us
to a higher place
Makin' the kind_of love we make
Kind of love we make
Makin' the kind_of love we make
You said isn't that better rising up from my sink
Hair down to your shoulders show me bright blue streaks
One and then another and some blue on the ground
Well, all of this color and it's so dark out
In the world
May we hold on to the pretty stuff
Showed me your tattoo of Neptune
And told me that nowhere's ever far enough
Then I was driving you home
I was driving you home
Dead of that winter in my brother's car
Heavy snow settled took us twice as long
Smoked out the window then you drew me a map
Said this is us here now look_at all of that
You were reaching
No this can't be all we ever are
Maybe we try California
Maybe we marry us some movie stars
Then I was driving you home
I was driving home
Found you much later you were in it deep
Dive down on the corner where you drank for free
Wrapped your tiny fingers_round a microphone
Oh, and you were singing you were no, no nobody's woman
I knew a_couple boys who thought you were
Said you're just trying to teach them
But look how they never learn
They never learn they never learn
I was driving you home
I was driving you home
Them neon lights
Look good on you, so good on you
But we ain't got
No room to move, no room to move
We need some space, and I know a place
Outside of town where it don't ever close down
No, we never close down
Yeah, we can two-step
Put cha boots_on, baby, we can do that
Girl,_cut a little_loose, you can move that
Move_that, aw yeah
I'll take you dancin' in the country
Levi's in them low_beams
Spin you in some red dirt
Sweep you off of both feet
Out_here where the sun sets
Silverado_backbeat
You'll never wanna go home
And never wanna not be
Dancin' in the country
Dancin' in the country
Yeah, it goes left, right, left
You makin' me wanna sway
You makin' me wanna play
Some Alabama and Jackson
Got you 'round my neck
You makin' me wanna stay
You makin' me wanna lay ya down here in the pasture
Yeah, we can two-step
Put cha boots_on, baby, we can do that
Girl,_cut a little_loose, you can move that
Move_that, aw yeah
I'll take you dancin' in the country
Levi's in them low_beams
Spin you in some red dirt
Sweep you off of both feet
Out_here where the sun sets
Silverado_backbeat
You'll never wanna go home
And never wanna not be
Dancin' in the country
Dancin' in the country
Aw yeah
I know you feel that heat
Watermelon summer
Get them Luccheses
Stompin' like the thunder
We can two-step
Put cha boots_on, baby, we can do that
Girl,_cut a little_loose, you can move that
Move_that, aw yeah
I'll take you dancin' in the country
Levi's in them low_beams
Spin you in some red dirt
Sweep you off of both feet (Aw yeah)
Out_here where the sun sets
Silverado_backbeat
You'll never wanna go home
And never wanna not be
Dancin' in the country (don't stop, don't stop,_keep it movin')
Dancin' in the country (don't stop, don't stop,_keep it movin')
Dancin' in the country (don't stop, don't stop,_keep it movin')
Dancin' in the country (don't stop, don't stop,_keep it movin')
Let's go
Can you lift me up to a higher place?
Forget everything that was before
Turn your_face around
Like the salted sphere
Turn yourself around
To see what once was there
Everything that rises must_converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must_converge
Everything that rises...
Jesus lift me up to a higher plane
Can you come around before I go insane?
Cast me not in hell
Where the demons rage
Turn yourself around
To see what I can save
Everything that rises must_converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must_converge
Everything that rises....
Turn yourself away
From the wickedness, I said
Evil comes to play
In the image of the dead
Everything rises, must_converge
Everything rises in a word
Everything rises, must_converge
Everything rises....
You're pulling out your cigarette
You bring it up towards your_lips
You breathe and push the smoke away
just like you do with all your friends
Your room is messy and full_of clothes
The curtains drawn, the windows closed
When did the person that I love turn into someone I don't know?
'Cause there's a light gone from your eyes
Like the whole world's not as bright until you find another high
There's so_much pain inside your voice
And you try to drown it out with anything to fill the void
But, trust me, mate, you've_got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promisе that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
Wе almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
I'm not giving up on you
I say it's time we have the talk
Make a move towards the door
And you deny there's anything you've_got to hide or answer for
You say, "I don't want you in my place"
"Just get the fuck out of my face"
But I won't give up so easy 'cause I know you'd do the same
So, trust me, mate, you've_got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promise that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
We almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
And, if it gets worse
Before it gets_better
Don't be afraid to fall
'Cause I won't let ya
If it gets worse
Before it gets_better
Don't be afraid to fall
So, trust me, mate, you've_got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promise that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
We almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
Well I held you like a lover
Happy hands and your elbow in the appropriate place
And we ignored our others, happy plans
For that delicate look upon your_face
Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no_one knows what we have done
Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?
Well you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands
And my foot in the appropriate place
And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands
In the mild issue of our disgrace
Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum
Well I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has accidental babies
For we are in love
Do you come
Together ever with him?
Is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?
What about me?
Cheers_darlin'
Here's to you and your lover boy
Cheers_darlin'
I got years to wait around
for you
Cheers_darlin'
I've got your wedding bells
in my ear
Cheers_darlin'
You give me three cigarettes to
smoke my tears away
And I die when you mention
his name
And I lied I should have
kissed you
When we were running in the rain
What am I darlin'
A whisper in your ear
A piece_of your cake
what am I darlin'
The boy you can fear
Or your biggest mistake
Cheers_darlin'
Here's to you and your
lover man
Cheers_darlin'
I just hang around and eat
from a can
Cheers_darlin'
I got a ribbon of green
on my guitar
Chrres darlin'
I got a beauty queen
To sit not very far_from me
I die when he comes around
To take you home
I'm too shy
I should have kissed you
when we were alone
What am I darlin'
A whisper in your ear
A piece_of your cake
What am i darlin
The boy you can fear
Or your biggest mistake
Oh what am I
What am i darlin'
I got years to wait
Just a smile, just a glance
The Prince of Darkness
He just walked past
There's been a lot of people
And they've had a lot to say
But this time, I'm gonna tell it my way
There was a town
There was a strange little town, they called The World
It_was a lonely, lonely little town
'Til one day a stranger appeared
And their hearts rejoiced
And the sad little town was happy again
But there was some that doubted
They disbelieved so they mocked him
And that stranger, he went away
Now the sad little town that was sad yesterday
It's a lot sadder today
I walked in a lot of places I never should have been
But I know that the Messiah, he will come again
It's the sugar so sweet
The kind I like to eat
You and me
Tell no_one else about it
I'm gonna make you mine
Cause I know we've got the time
Now and then baby
Hey I want you to know
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
Come on in the back of my 57
Let me show you the way
Way to heaven
You're looking so sweet
yes you are
I'll make sure that
you got some heat
I've got you on my mind
You know you've_got my time
Now and then baby
I want you to know
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
I'm falling in love with you
I'm in love with you
You make all my dreams come_true
Make all my dreams come_true
Falling in love with you
I wanna_marry you
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
I wanna_marry you
Isn't that what you want too
Use to be so easy
To give my heart away
But I found that the hard way
was the price you have to pay
I found that that love
is no friend of mine
I should have
know'n time after time
So long
it was so long_ago
But I've still
got the blues_for you
Use to be so easy
Fall in love again
But I found that the hard way
It's a roll that leeds to pain
I found now that love
is more_than just a game
Play and to win
but you loose just the same
So long
it was so long_ago
But I've
still got the blues_for you
So_many years
since I seal you face
You will my heart
there's an_empty space
Used to be
So long
it was so long_ago
But I've
still got the blues_for you
Golden days come and go
There_is one_thing I know
I've still got the blues_for you
Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two
jewels in the sky
Your back is straight
Your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One_more cup of coffee fore I go
One_more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below
Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to
pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles
as he_calls out
For another plate of food
One_more cup of coffee for the road
One_more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your_mama and yourself
You've never learned to
read or write
There's_no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One_more cup of coffee for the road
One_more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below
It's four in the morning
the end of December
I'm writing you now
just to see if you're better
New_York is cold
but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street
all through the evening
I hear that you're building
your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now
I hope you're keeping
some kind_of record
Yes and Jane came by
with a lock of your hair
She_said that you gave it to her
That night that you
planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear
Ah the last time we saw you
you looked so_much older
Your famous blue raincoat
as torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station
to meet every train
And you came home
without Lili Marlene
And you treated my woman
to a flake of your life
And when she came back
she was nobody's wife
Well I see you there
with the rose in your teeth
One_more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards
And what can I tell you my brother
my killer
What can I possibly say
I guess that I miss you
I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way
If you ever come by here
for Jane or for me
Your enemy is sleeping
and his woman is free
Yes and thanks
for the trouble you took
from her eyes
I thought it was there
for good so I never tried
And Jane came by with a
lock of your hair
She_said that you gave it to her
That night that you
planned to go clear
Well based on your smile
I'm betting all of this
Might be over soon
But your bound to win
Cause if I'm betting against you
I think I'd_rather lose
But this is all that I have
So please
Take what's left of this heart and use
Please use only what you really need
You know I only have so little
So please
Mend your broken_heart and leave
I know it's not your style
I can tell by the way that you move
It's real real soon
But I'm on your side
And I don't want to be your regret
I'd_rather be your cocoon
But this is all that you have
So please
Let me take what's left of
your heart and I will use
I swear I'll use only what I need
I know you only have so little
So please
Let me mend my broken_heart and
You said this was all you had
And it's all I need
But blah blah blah
Because it fell apart and
I guess it's all you knew
And all I have
But now we have
Only confused hearts and
I guess all we have
Is really all we need
So please
Let's take these broken_hearts and use
Let's use only what we really need
You know we only have so little
So please
Take these broken_hearts and leave
I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got a big coat on
I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
And run and run
At the pumpkin patch
The tractor rolls on
The sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall_asleep
The_whole way home
I don't know why all
the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared
of anything at all
Don't know if Snow
White's house is near or far_away
But I know that I had the best day
With you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean I come home crying
and You hold me tight
And grab the keys
And you drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away And we talk
and window shop Until I've
forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm gonna
talk to Now at school
I know I'm laughing on
the car ride home with you
Don't know how long
it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better_than nothing
I grew_up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There_is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint
set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the edge of princesses
and pirate ships And the
seven dwarves Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady
in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees
change in the fall
And you were on my side
Even when I was wrong And I
love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today
No, I really don't think so
That you think I'd be incapable of being on my own
No, I really don't think so
That I would for a second let you back in through my door
I have spent many a nights
Even when you are by my side
I shed tears I couldn't dry
I shed tears I couldn't dry
But I should thank you for
Taking my blindfold off now
I ain't jaded no more, no more
And I take pride in being the one that said goodbye
That could only mean I am me, once more
You would turn your head the other way
So you won't have to listen to what I have to say
You assume that I needed you
But you didn't realize that I needed no_one but myself
I needed no_one but myself
But I should thank you for
Taking my blindfold off now
I ain't jaded no more, no more
And I take pride in being the one that said goodbye
That could only mean I am me, once more
That could only mean I am me, once more
That could only mean I am me, once more
I like the way you sound
in the morning we're on the phone
and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best
sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my
focus I watch you talk
you didn't notice I hear the words
but all I can think is
we should be together
Every_time you smile I smile
and every_time you shine
I'll shine for you
Whoa I'm feeling you baby
don't be afraid to jump_then fall
jump_then fall_into me
baby I'm never gonna leave you
say that you wanna be with me too
cause I'm gonna stay through
it all so jump_then fall
Well I like the way your
hair falls in your_face
you got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your_face
oh I've never been so wrapped up
honey I like way you're everything
I've ever wanted I had time to
think it over and all I can say
is come closer take a deep_breath
and jump_then fall_into me
Cause every_time you smile I smile
and every_time you shine
I'll shine for you
Whoa I'm feeling you baby

Jump_then fall Jump_then fall
into me into me yeah
Long were the nights
When the days once
revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor
won't fall through again
My mother accused me of
losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue_sky
and go back
And turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules
every day
Wonderin which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to
let you know why
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I shoulda_known
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away
And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret
How I ignored when they said
Run as_fast as you can
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
Dear John
I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's
too_young
To be played by your dark
twisted games
When I loved you so
I shoulda_known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
And never impressed by me
Acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
Cuz you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young
To be messed with the girl
in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too_young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song
You should've_known
You shoulda_known
Don't you think I was too_young
You shoulda_known
I still remember the look
on your_face
Been through the darkness
at 1 58
The words that you whispered for
just us to know
You told me you loved me so
why did you go away
go away
I do recall now the smell
of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran_off the plane
That July 9th the beat
of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
Never_thought
we'd have a last kiss
Never_imagined
we'd_end like this
Your name forever the name
on my lips
I do remember the swing
of your step
The life of the party
you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and
then you pulled me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did because
I loved your handshake
meeting my father
I love how you walk with your
hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me
when I was in the middle_of
saying something
There's not a day
I don't miss those rude
interruptions and
I'll go sit on the floor wearing
your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
how to be something you miss
Never_thought
we'd have a last kiss
Never_imagined
we'd_end like this
Your name forever the name
on my lips
So I'll watch your life
in pictures like I used_to
watch you sleep and
I'll feel you forget me
like I use to feel you
breathe and
I'll keep up with our old friends
just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
and I hope the sun_shines and
it's a beautiful_day and
Something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
we can plan for a change in
weather and time
I never planned on you
changing your mind
So
I'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
how to be something you miss
Never_thought
we'd have a last kiss
Never_imagined
we'd_end like this
Your name forever the name
on my lips
Just like our_last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our_last
I will never change
your mind
In this world
we're lost and found
The dice keep rolling
stuck in a loop
No gravity in this game
Here we're dancing
with paper cranes
But when it all melts
in the sea you'll be gone
J I'm looking_for J
I'm waiting_for J
I'm looking_for J
The pirates call us sick
preperson
Turn your radio off that's
what Tempunauts do
Our voice keep growing
reaching the sun
No remedy in this game
Here we're dancing
with paper cranes
But when it all melts
in the sea you'll be gone
J I'm looking_for J
I'm waiting_for J
I'm looking_for J
Oh draw me a light
Oh take me to the mars
J I'm looking_for J
I'm waiting_for J
I'm looking_for J
Warm breath is all it takes
To feel the rush a little break
From how you thought it'd be
I'm not the type to boast
I just need to make the most
Of this reality
If every little thing
doesn't work out
like you planned
Remember every little footstep
doesn't have to land
And every little dream
that you have may_not come_true
But today we're starting_new
we're starting_new
One life is all you have
So be good
be good to yourself
Don't shy away
If every little thing
doesn't work out
like you planned
Remember every little footstep
doesn't have to land
And every little dream
that you have may_not come_true
But today we're starting_new
I don't want to live like this
Regretting all the
things I missed
And finally the feet I've got
Are gonna dance yah
If every little thing
doesn't work out
like you planned
Remember every little footstep
doesn't have to land
And every little dream
that you have may_not come_true
But today we're starting_new
Oh we're starting_new
We're starting_new
Midnight, and I'm a waiting on the twelve oh five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do_anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away_from you
Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do_anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away_from you
Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do_anything for you
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really_smart
The_joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do_anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away_from you
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Playing_with the queen of hearts
Candles burning, ruby red
Sheets are falling off the bed
Run your fingers through my hair
I know what you're thinking, take me there
You hypnotise me with your touch
And I can never get_enough of you, it's true
And anywhere you wanna go
My hand is only yours to hold, oh you know
I'm so obsessed with the way that your_lips
Kiss me like crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, you got me losing it
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, yeah
Every_time you walk_away
I guess your perfume likes to stay
On my pillow, on my shirt
Listen baby, for what it's worth
I'm so obsessed with the way that your_lips
Kiss me crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, you got me losing it
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, yeah_yeah yes
So give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me now
And I'm so obsessed with the way that your_lips
Kiss me crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, got me losing it babe
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, oh babe, yeah
When your friends are around
And you kiss me in front_of everybody
You know it drives me crazy girl
So come and lay one on my lips girl
Just do it to me, you know it, I'm so obsessed
You're never getting rid_of me baby
Never getting rid_of me baby
You know it, you know
You're never getting rid_of me baby
Never getting rid_of me baby
Break it down for me baby
Girl you know you're driving me crazy
I can't get_enough
I think you're feeling me too baby
So lay me down, show me right, do me good
Let's turn out these lights baby
I'm so obsessed with the way that you walk_into the room baby
I can't even take it, you know, you know you do
I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm obsessed baby
In a little café just the other_side of the border
She was just sitting there givin' me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man, José
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say, yeah
Come a little_bit closer
You're my kind_of man
So big and so strong
Come a little_bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long
So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
That I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
"Vamoose, José's on his way"
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah
Come a little_bit closer
You're my kind_of man
So big and so strong
Come a little_bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long
Then the music stopped
When I looked the café was empty
Then I heard José say
"Man you know you're in trouble plenty"
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to José, yeah
Come a little_bit closer
You're my kind_of man
So big and so strong
Come a little_bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long
La la-la-la la-la
La la-la-la la-la
Ho ho la-la
La_la la-la
I'd like to become the man that
I am supposed to be
But I'm a rotten tooth in
A mouth full_of crooked teeth
Now doing the right thing ain't easy
It_doesn't come naturally
And now you can barely look_at me
And I can barely speak
And love we used_to know
Where to find it
These feelings they don't go
And I can't hide it
Do you still want me
You can't look_at me
I should say I'm sorry
But my throat won't let me speak
I've_been hiding all my flaws
But you saw the truth on my face
And now that
it's all come crashing down
You've handled it with so_much grace
So now you know all my secrets
And yet you still talk to me
Your love was the atomic bomb
And my heart was Nagasaki
And love I used_to know
Who the hell I was
Now I can't shake your shadow
I can't escape your ghost
Do you still want me
You can't look_at me
I should say I'm sorry
But my throat won't let me speak
Do you still want me
I can_hardly breath
I should say I'm sorry
You can do better_than me
[Chorus]
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
[Verse_1]
So tired_of sleepin' alone
So tired_of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's_goin' on
Are we goin' strong?
She felt_like resting her head
My shoulder was the perfect height
We fit so right, so what's_goin' on?
'Cause I've_been undone
The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've_been undone
[Chorus]
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost
[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
[Verse_2]
And still the memory's right there
She put the breeze in my hair
No kiss was softer, softer than this
I'm readin' her lips, oh
Each line I read
She left her books in my bed
And her song in my head
I've_been undone
[Chorus]
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost
[Post-Chorus]
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
Lost
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
Lost
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
[Chorus]
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh,_Saturday Sun
I met_someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
Oh,_Saturday Sun
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
Lost, oh Saturday_Sun
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
I met_someone
Oh,_Saturday Sun
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
[Outro]
Ba-ba,_ba-ba
Ba-ba,_ba-b-ba-ba
He's a phone call to his parents
He's a bible by the bed
He's the t_shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from
One of the good_ones
He's one of the good_ones
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find
when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good_ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good_ones
You'll know him
when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh the way he pulls me in
I've known a_couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good_ones
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find
when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good_ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good_ones
We should all find us one
They're out there minus one
Some of the good_ones
Yeah I got a good one
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find
when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good_ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good_ones

I fell in love with a girl on the far side of the world
If I could fold the globe, our love would be more_than just heard
And I feel her smile as she talks
But it's not the same from an ocean away
I fell in love with a girl on the far side of the world
[Chorus]
If I shut my eyes, will you appear?
'Cause I'm not me without you here
And is it fair to let you know
That I'm afraid to let you go?
[Verse_2]
I fell in love with a girl on the dark_side of the moon
But when she steps out into the light, she's gone too_soon
And as she shines and wanes
I watch her wave from the milky way
I fell in love with a girl on the dark_side of the moon
[Chorus]
If I shut my eyes, will you appear?
'Cause I'm not me without you here
And is it fair to let you know
That I'm afraid to let you go?
[Post-Chorus]
If I shut my eyes, will you appear?
'Cause I can't be without you here
If I'm a fool, then let me know
And I'll make peace with the unknown
[Outro]
I fell in love with a girl who_lives inside my mind
And I go searching but she's right behind my eyes
And when she steps in frame, I reach out but she fades away
I fell in love with a girl who I may never find
Pretty bird
You just crossed my way
And I know
it's 'cause you're flying away
But I kinda really
want you to stay
Pretty bird
You had no time to see me
You were finally leaving the nest
I just wish I'd met you
before the best
That I know is yet to come
Just tell me once you're done
I saw you briefly and I said Hey
But it was too_late
'cause you were flying to LA
Pretty bird
You just crossed my way
And I know
it's 'cause you're flying away
But I kinda really want you to stay
Pretty bird
You had no time to see me
You were finally leaving the nest
I just wish I'd met you
before the best
That I know is yet to come
Just tell me once you're done
I saw you briefly and I said Hey
But it was too_late
'cause you were flying to LA
Verse_1
Some_things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leavin'
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go
Chorus
Like a runaway_Southbound train
Like an_Arizona desert_rain
Like_lightning in the sky
Like_fireworks in July
Like a left_field homerun_ball
Like a whiskey_shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going,_going, gone
Verse_2
I can say it wasn't_meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting_go
Change the way the river_flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind
Chorus
Like a runaway_Southbound train
Like an_Arizona desert_rain
Like_lightning in the sky
Like_fireworks in July
Like a left_field homerun_ball
Like a whiskey_shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going,_going, gone
Instrumental Break

She ain't got one bit of stick_around
There's_no sense in tryin' to slow her down
Chorus

Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been getting better by the day but tonight I drink
You say I gotta get over you
And get sober too
I got a lotta habits I gotta kick
Well, weigh out all your options
And take your pick
I can either_burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right_now
Never want you back long_as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell ya, girl
But I'm only quitting one_thing at a time
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forget
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all the help I can get
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey
Some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop loving you
Hey, what you want me to do?
I can either_burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right_now
Never want you back long_as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell ya, girl
But I'm only quitting one_thing at a time
Ah, yeah, I hate to tell you
Ah, yeah, I hate to tell you
I ain't_no superman
I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on
Then I need me something in my hand
Ain't_nothing wrong with that
And if you ain't coming back
I can either_burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right_now
Never want you back long_as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby, off my mind
I hate to tell ya, girl
But I'm only quitting one_thing at a time
Ah, yeah, I hate to tell you
Ah, yeah, I hate to tell you
Ah, yeah, I hate to tell you
Have you ever been afraid
Of something you don't have?
Been scared to start
'Cause you don't know the end yet?
Like the cards in your hands
But you don't wanna play
Or the words in your head
That you don't wanna say out_loud
You don't wanna get shut down
[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie awake in bed catching your breath
If you need to cry but you've_been holding back
[Chorus]
If you're_hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There_is a light at the end of this tunnel
If you're_hurting
It means you're here
[Verse_2]
It means you're one step closer
And two steps left behind
With your back to the mirror
'Cause you don't know what you'll_find yet
To the ones in your heart that'll never leave
To the ones in the crowd that just wanna be seen
You can lie in bed and catch your breath
It's okay to cry
The tears won't hold you back
[Chorus]
If you're_hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There_is a light at the end of this tunnel
If you're_hurting
It means you're here
[Bridge]
If you're fighting (If_you're fighting)
If you're broken (If_you're broken)
It means you're human (It means you're human)
You're one of us (You're one of us)
If you're bleeding (If_you're bleeding)
If you're healing (If_you're healing)
It means you're human (It means you're human)
You're one of us
[Chorus]
If you're_hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There_is a light at the end of this tunnel
Give yourself a little time to feel
If you're_hurting
I hope you hear me
When you're barely hanging on
There_is a light at the end of this tunnel
If you're_hurting
It means you're here
I'm glad you're here
I've_been lookin'_at you
from across the room
'Bout time I got my nerve
Well you might tell me "Boy hell naw"
But hell what can it hurt?
'Cause I just wanna
Spin you around,
and around this dance floor

Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's,
and baby if you're willin'

'Cause the way you stole
my heart without a sign
Girl, it oughta be a crime
Got a pretty good feelin'

Get your digits if I can find the right line

Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's,

I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole

I just wanna spin you around tonight
My Saturn has returned
When I turned twenty-seven, everything started to change
Took a long time, but I learned
There's two kinds_of people
One is a giver, and one's always trying to take
All they can take
So, I'm saying goodbye
To the people that I feel are real good at wasting my time
No regrets, baby
I just think that maybe
You go your way, and I'll go mine
It's been a real good time
But you've_got dark energy
Something I can't unsee
And I've got to take care of myself
I've found a deeper well
I used_to wake and bake
Roll out of bed, hit the gravity bong that I made
And start the day
For a while, it got me by
Everything I did seemed better when I was high
I don't know why
So, I'm getting rid_of the habits
That I feel are real good at wasting my time
No regrets, baby
I just think that maybe
It's natural when things lose their shine
So other things can glow
I've gotten older, now I know
How to take care of myself
I've found a deeper well
Hmm, mmm
When I was growing up
We had what we needed
Shoes on our feet
But the world was as flat as a plate
And that's okay
The things I was taught only took me so far
Had to figure the rest out myself
And then I found
I found a deeper well
Hmm, mmm
Hmm
Loving_him is like
driving a new_Maserati
down a dead-end_street
Faster than the wind
passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
Loving_him is like
trying to change your mind
once you're already flying
through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright
just before they lose it all
Losing_him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark_grey
all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving_him was red
Loving_him was red
Touching him_was like realizing
all you ever wanted was right
there in front_of you
Memorizing him_was as
easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite_song
Fighting with him_was like
trying to solve a crossword and
realizing there's_no right answer
Regretting him_was like
wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
Losing_him was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark_grey
all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying to
know somebody you never met
But loving_him was red
Oh red
Burning red
Remembering him comes
in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now
gotta let go
But moving on
from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning_red
Burning it was red
Oh losing him_was blue
like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark_grey
all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying
to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving_him was red
Yeah_yeah red
We're burning_red
And that's why he's spinnin'
'round in my head
Comes back to me burning_red
Yeah_yeah
His love was like
driving a new_Maserati
down a dead-end_street
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt_like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these_days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh,_oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used_to be a little_kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing_else I could do
And I forget_about you long_enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle_of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was_there, I remember it all too_well, yeah
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too_much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being_honest
I'm a crumpled up piece_of paper lying_here
'Cause I remember it_all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very_first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid_of it
'Cause you remember it all too_well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It_was rare, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It_was rare, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
Find myself at your door
Just like all those_times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This_is the last time I'm_asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This_is the last time I'm_asking you why
You break my heart
in the blink_of an_eye
eye eye
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those_times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come_back
Everything is better
And right before your eyes
I'm aching no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me-he-e-he-e-he-e-
he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he
This_is the last time I'm_asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This_is the last time I'm_asking you why
You break my heart
in the blink_of an_eye
eye eye
This_is the last time
you tell me I've got it wrong
This_is the last time
I say it's been you all along
This_is the last time
I let you in my door
This_is the last time
I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
Oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
This_is the last time I'm_asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This_is the last time I'm_asking you why
You break my heart
in the blink_of an_eye
This_is the last time
I'm_asking you this
This_is the last time
I'm_asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
Put my name at the top of your list
This_is the last time I'm_asking you why
This_is the last time I'm_asking you why
You break my heart
in the blink_of an_eye
You break my heart
This_is the last time I'm_asking you
last time I'm_asking you
Last time I'm_asking you this
This_is the last time I'm_asking you
last time I'm_asking you
Last time I'm_asking you this
This_is the last time I'm_asking you
last time I'm_asking you
Last time I'm_asking you this
This_is the last time I'm_asking you
last time I'm_asking you
Last time I'm_asking you this
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps
up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to
call your name
Just know I'm right_here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to
call your name
Just know I'm right_here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I've watched you so long
screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night
for all these games
Just know I'm right_here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
When you're weary
feelin small
when tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side oh
when times get rough
And friend just
can't be found
Like a_bridge over_troubled
water I'll lay me down
Like a_bridge over_troubled
water I'll lay me down
When you're down and out
when you're on the street
when evening fall so hard
I will comfort you
I'm take your part oh
when darkness_comes
And pain is all around
Like a_bridge over_troubled
water I'll lay me down
Like a_bridge over_troubled
water I'll lay me down
Sail on silver girl
sail on by
your time has come to shine
All your dreams are
on their way
See how they shine oh
if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a_bridge over triubled
water I'll aese your mind
Like a_bridge over triubled
water I'll aese your mind
dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
dance me through the panic till I’m gathered safely in
lift me like an olive branch and be my
homeward dove
dance me to the end of love
dance me to your beauty when the witness are gone
let me feel you moving like they do in babylon
show me slowly what I only know the limits of
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
we’re_both of us beeath our love, we’re_both of us above
dance me to the end of love
dance me to the children who are asking to be born
dance me through the curtains that
our kisses have outworn
raise a tent of shelter now though every thread is torn
dance me to the end of love
dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
dance me through the panic till
I’m gathered safely in
touch me with your naked hand or
touch me with your glove
dance me to the end of love
April come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain;
May, she will stay,
Resting in my arms again.
June, she'll change her tune,
In_restless walks she'll prowl the night;
July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight.
August, die she must,
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
September I'll remember
A love once new has now grown old.

Starry Starry night
paint your palette
blue and grey
Look_out on a summers day
with eyes that know
the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
sketch the trees
and the daffodils
Catch the breeze
and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy
linen land
and now I under stand
what you tried to say to me
How you suffered
for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen
they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry Starry night
flaming flowrs
that brightly biaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
reflect in Vincent's eyes
of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath
the artists loving hand
And now i under stand
what you tried to say to me
How you suffered
for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen
they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
for they could not love you
but still your love was true
and when no hope was left in
sight on that
starry starry night
you took your life
as lovers of ten do
but i could have
told you Vincent
This world was never meant for
one as beautiful as you
Starry Starry night
portraits hung in empty halls
frame less heads
on name less walls
with eyes that watch the world
and can't for get
like the stran gers
that you've met
the ragged men in ragged clothes
the silver thorn of bloody rose
lie crushed and broken
on the virgin snow
and now i think i know
what you tried to say to me
How you suffered
for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen
they're not listning
still perhaps they never will
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grievin'
But if you wanna leave
take good care
I hope you have a lot of
nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn
bad out there
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by
just upon a smile
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you
like a child, girl
You know I've_seen
a lot of what the world can do
And it's breakin' my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you
a sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you wanna leave
take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice
friends out there
But just remember
there's a lot of bad and beware
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by
just upon a smile
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you
like a child, girl
Baby, I love you
But if you wanna leave
take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice
friends out there
But just remember
there's a lot of bad and beware
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by
just upon a smile
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you
like a child, girl
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by
just upon a smile
Oh, baby,_baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you
like a child, girl -
Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy
I've_been walking these streets so long
Singing the same_old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle is the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are_shining on me
후렴 : Like a rhinestone_cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone_cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone
Well I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're_riding a train
That's taking the long way
And I dream of the thing I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are_shining on me
I can`t remember
what I planned tomorrow
I can`t remember
when it`s time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came_before
I wanted to think
there was endless love
Until I saw the light
dim in your eyes
In the dead of the night
I found out
Sometimes there`s love
that won`t survive
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful_disease
Laura kept all her disappointments
Locked up in a box behind
her closet door
She pulled the blinds
and listened to the thunder
With no way out
from the family store
We all told her things
could get better
When you just say_goodbye
I`ll lay awake one_more night
Caught in a vision I want to deny
And did I mention
the note that I found
Taped to my locked front_door
It talked about no_regrets
As it slipped from my hand
to the scuffed tile floor
I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie`s lullaby
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
Such a beautiful
Such a beautiful_disease
We were full_of the stuff
that every dream rested
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattooed conclusion
That the big one was
knocking on the door
What started as a mass delusion
Would take me far_from
the place I adore
New_York City
Such a beautiful_disease
New_York City
You are my beautiful
Such a beautiful_disease
She lifts her skirt up to her knees
Walks through the garden rows with her barefeet, laughing
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters.
I walk on down the hill
through grass grown tall and brown
and still it's hard somehow to let go of my pain
On past the busted back
of this old and rusted Cadillac
that sinks into this field collecting rain
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged.
Of these cutthroat, busted sunsets
These cold and damp, white mornings I've grown weary
If through these cracked and dusty dimestore lips
I spoke these_words out_loud
No one would hear me.
Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from your hair
and kiss me with that country mouth, so plain.
Outside the rain is tapping on the leaves
to me, it sounds like they're applauding us
The quiet love we've made
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged.
Well I looked my demons in the eyes
Laid bare my chest said do your best and destroy me
See I've_been to hell and back so_many times
I must admit you kind_of bore me
There's a lot of things that can kill a man
There's a lot of ways to die
Yes and some already dead that walk beside you
There's a lot of things I don't understand
Why so_many people lie
Well it's the hurt I hide that fuels the fires inside me
Will I always feel this way
So empty, so estranged
It's strange to think the
songs we used_to sing
the smiles the flowers
everything is gone
yesterday I found out about you
even now just looking at you
feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes
You should've said no
you should've gone home
you should've thought twice
before you let it all go
you should've_known that word
bout what you did with her
would get back to me
get back to me
and I Should've been there
in the back of you mind
and I shouldn't be
asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for my
forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no
baby and you might still have me
You can see that I've_been crying
and baby you know
all the right things
to say
but do you honestly expect me
to believe
we could ever be the same
you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of
weakness and you said yes
You should've said no
you should've gone home
you should've thought twice
before you let it all go
you should've_known that word
bout what you did with her
would get back to me
get back to me
and I Should've been there
in the back of you mind
and I shouldn't be
asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for my
forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no
baby and you might still have me
I can't resist
before you go tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this
no no no no no no
You should've said no
you should've gone home
you should've thought twice
before you let it all go
you should've_known that word
bout what you did with her
would get back to me
get back to me
and I Should've been there
in the back of you mind
and I shouldn't be
asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for my
forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no
baby and you might still have me
This_is my last dance with you
This_is my only chance to do all I can do
To let you know that what I feel for you is real
This_is the last_chance for us
This_is the moment that I just cannot let end
Before I know that there is a chance were more_than friends
So don’t let go, don’t let go
Make it last all night
This_is my last_chance to make you mine
I kept my feelings so deep
I kept my dreams of you and me somewhere inside
Although I prayed that you would see it in my eyes
But this is my last_chance to say
What’s in my heart before you stay out of my life
And then you’ll understand the way I feel inside
So hold me close ‘cause it feels so right
This_is my last_chance to make it mine
Make this dream reality
So close and yet so far
Gotta find a way into your heart
Gotta speak my mind
Gotta open up to you this time
I can’t let you slip away tonight
This_is my last_chance with you
This_is my only chance to do all I can do
To let you know that what I feel for you is so real
So don’t let go
Just make it last all night long
This_is my last_chance to make you mine, yeah
To make you mine
Drop_everything now
The way you move is like a
full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the
kind_of reckless that should
send me running
But I kinda know that I
won't get far
And you stood there
in front_of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you
couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop_everything now
Meet me in the pouring_rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause' I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something_that'll
haunt me
when you're not around
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me
you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's
really something
You find I'm even better
than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the
rest_of the world
But with you
I know it's no good
And I could wait
patiently but
I really wish you would
Drop_everything now
Meet me in the pouring_rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something_that'll haunt
me when you're not around
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
I run my fingers through
your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your
eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make it
feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show
Drop_everything now
Meet me in the pouring_rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile
Get me with those green
eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something_that'll haunt me
when you're
not around
Cause I see_sparks fly
whenever you smile

It_was I first_week Myrtle Beach
Where it all began
It_was a 102 nothin to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in
We were summertime
sippin' sippin'
sweet tea kissing off of your_lips
T shirt drippin' drippin' wet
How could I forget
Watching that blonde_hair swing
to every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every_wave crashing down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It_was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer
of 19 you and me
We had our first dance in the sand
It_was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up so in love
Let's just stay night here
till the sun starts creepin'
creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin'
thinkin' of
When i looked_at you
Watchin' that blonde_hair swing
to every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
of every_wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
that day we had to leave
It_was everything
we wanted it to be
The summer
of 19 you and me
You and me
Watching that blonde_hair swing
to every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
Beautiful Beautiful
Watching that blown hair_swing
to every song I'd sing
You were_California beautiful
I was playing everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
of every_wave crashin' down
like the tears we cried
that day we had to leave
It_was everything
we wanted it to be
the summer of 19 you and me
First week myrtle beach
Where it all began
It's funny_how we met on the telephone
You and I on the edge of the unknown
Oh in only a moment's time
I knew my heart was yours and yours was mine
When I saw you waiting at your place
Something felt familiar in your_face
Oh you smiled as if to say
I knew my heart was yours from the first day
We were right
We stood through it all
Holding tight
Whenever we fall
What we found is second to none
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
There were days when I thought_I'd lost you
I read the letter aloud what could I do
Now we're right back where we belong
Don't second guess your heart it's never wrong
We were right
We stood through it all
Holding tight
Whenever we fall
What we found is second to none
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
I knew I knew I knew this would be love
She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul
And I could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me
will work each time
Calling me to come_back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind
Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up
And I, I never_understood
what was at stake
I never thought your love was
worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling in your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling in your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling in your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling in your mind
Won't you let it be
And I could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me
will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again,
I'm burning up
And I, I never_understood
what was at stake
I never thought your love
was worth its wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
Right now he's probably slow dancing
with a bleached blond tramp
and she's probably getting frisky
right now, he's probably buying
her some fruity little drink
'cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up
behind her with a pool stick
showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
That I dug my key into the side
of his pretty_little souped up
4 wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger
to both headlights
slashed a hole in all 4 tires
Maybe next time he'll think
before he_cheats
Right now, she's probably up
singing some
white trash version
of Shania karaoke
Right now,
she's probably saying, I'm drunk
and he's a thinking that
he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably
dabbing on
3 dollars worth of
that bathroom Polo*
Oh, and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side
of his pretty_little souped up
4 wheel drive
carved my name into
his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger
to both headlights
slashed a hole in all 4 tires
Maybe next time he'll think
before he_cheats
I might've saved a little trouble
for the next girl
'cause the next time that he_cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side
of his pretty_little souped up
4 wheel drive
carved my name into his
leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger
to both headlights
slashed a hole in all 4 tires
Maybe next time he'll think
before he_cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think
before he_cheats
Oh, before he_cheats oh,_oh
Make her a flower in late December
When the sun is not shining on her
Write her a love song and play it all day long
To remind her of all that she is worth
Never never leave her
Take her on long drives for ice cream by sea sides
And give her your coat when she is cold
Tell_her you miss her when you're close enough to kiss her
And that you'd walk a thousand_miles to tell her so
But never never leave her
Take photographs of her on Brooklyn street in October
When her nervous smile is slightly curved
Some days when she is slightly down tell her it's okay to frown
It makes you just fall more in love with her
But never never leave her
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
For all the deadbeat dads
And the kids that they had
The ones that's left behind
that's always up on their minds
To know that there's_no excuse
To leave a boy in his youth
And now that dirty secret's
just some ugly truth
To be left all alone
To never pick_up the phone
And all the things I learned
I guess I learned on my own
But what's done has been done
And now your only son
Wants to share the love with you
he got from his mom
I said
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
I was still just a kid
Barely out of my crib
Left alone at home
yes I was raising my sibs
While my mother got paid
Always at someone's aid
She missed us kissed us
told us that she'd be home late
Now her kids is full grown
They've got kids of their own
Put the past behind you
mind you you're never alone
Cause my brothers they're two
Yes I got a nephew
Can't change who you are
until you change what you do
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Pull from the earth
Every last thing of worth
To know the soil is free of oil
to make that your work
To know that we share
The same water and air
So can't we be more mindful
of what we put in there
Cause we can't be_surprised
When the oceans do rise
To tell yourself you'll be okay
is to tell yourself lies
So let's change how we live
Less take and more give
It's in my mother's nature
now to always forgive
I said
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
Bad_boys need love too
You know who I'm_talkin' 'bout
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday_night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life_is short, make it sweet
[Verse_2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're_going baby I don't_care
I'm already there
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday_night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life_is short, make it sweet
[Bridge]
Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday_night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life_is short, make it sweet
Life_is short, make it sweet
Oh yeah
Everytime I look_at you
you slowly drift away
Your eyes are shut
and still you seem to see
the inner me
Everytime you touch my hand
I shrugg off anyway
But still you are
a field of energy
surrounding me
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Everytime you try to walk
away with all your strength
Some kind_of power
pulls you back again
Feels better then
Every try to leave behind
the cave in wich we stand
it leaves a wound
that someone has to mend
my only friend
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Ohh_we move like_magnet balls
Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired_of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out_loud
I've_been playing dead
My whole_life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time
[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
[Verse_2]
If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how_much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about
[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
[Verse_3]
I used_to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up
[Refrain]
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something
[Outro]
I'll climb through the window again
But right now, it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide_open
Let the dystopian morning_light pour in
Could you let me know
I could make some time
if you wanted
Couldn't find the phone
I guess I got it that summer
you said
I could be alright
if you could re-write my life
And I said it won't phase me
but I reckon I may've been wrong
I should let this go
I could be your water instead
I'll put on my coat
'Cause I could hear you stall
in the way you said
Is it alright to feel like I do at all
Got caught_up in the skylight
And the words just all came out wrong
Just called to let you know
This all is getting old
And I could be your water instead
Let me get my head aligned
Let my life be worth your while
Bend my arm I won't be far at all
I didn't know that
she was dancing right beside me
I only noticed
when she asked me so politely
could you play my favourite song
Latchin' on to all the words
that I was singing
It_wasn't hard to feel the heat
that she was bringing
But she was stringing me along
We danced the night away
She told me she would
stay the night at my place
But in the morning I called to say
You left some clothes last_night
And I wonder who you are
And I wonder are you far
You left still on my mind
And I'll never feel the same
Didn't even catch your name
She was drinking me
underneath the table
Tried to keep up
when I knew I wasn't able
She told me
practice what you preach
Then she kissed me
when I wasn't_expecting
Didn't think that
it would go in that direction
I guess its time for us to leave
We danced the night away
She told me she would
stay the night at my place
But in the morning I called to say
You left some clothes last_night
And I wonder who you are
And I wonder are you far
You left still on my mind
And I'll never feel the same
Didn't even catch your name
You left some clothes last_night
And I wonder who you are
And I wonder are you far
You left still on my mind
And I'll never feel the same
Didn't even catch your name
Just wanna know
You got me wondering
If you're there all alone
I'm on my couch
Wish you were blowing up
my phone
Something to let me know
that you're thinking of me
I'm sitting down
Just here wanting you
To come and take me out
With that dress
That's sitting in my closet how
Could I be such a fool
To even get it
I knew i wouldn't wear it
But how do you think
it's fine to forget_about me
And how do you not see me
Why does it have to be so hard
Wishing you were mine
Every_time that we're apart
I'm wishing you were mine
My heart is torn
Subtle tricks don't do it
For me anymore
So how about
You give me something more
Before I decide against it all yeah
And how do you think
it's fine to forget_about me
And how do you not see me
Why does it have to be so hard
Wishing you were mine
Every_time that we're apart
I'm wishing you were mine
I'm holding on to
what could happen
I feel like we could win
if you'd just let it
So come on be my babe
you know I feel it
But it's all in my head
And how do you think
it's fine to forget_about me
And how do you not see me
Why does it have to be so hard
Wishing you were mine
Every_time that we're apart
I'm wishing you were mine
All day at the bookstore
Curled up in the same chair
I was lost
In what we shared
[Verse_2]
On a train to Fleetwood
It began to rain
No one came
To get me
From the station
[Verse_3]
I walked home alone
With your song in my head
Finally understanding something
In what you said
In the moment
How the rain smelled
And I know now
And I know now
And I know now
Verse_1
You're callin' out the constellations
I swear you know 'em all by name
I see the moon accentuatin'
The summer freckles on your_face
Pre-Chorus
And I already miss right_now
And I wish I could slow this down
Slow it down
Chorus
'Cause time only moves in one_direction
These_are the nights we won't get back
Don't wanna waste one single second
Don't want the starts to fall so fast
'Cause someday we'll be sayin' how
We wish we could turn back around
Time only moves in one_direction
Come_on, get closеr, come, let me hold you now
Verse_2
'Causе I just wanna memorize you
And every detail I can see
So even_though we can't rewind
I'll have a picture I can keep

'Cause I already miss right_now
And I wish I could slow this down
Slow it down

'Cause time only moves in one_direction
These_are the nights we won't get back

That's what makes it better
So come, let me hold you now

you picked your chair to sit in
you made the bed in which you lay
i used_to tuck you in it
you let your dreams take you away
the clock was always tickin
i fought it off and stayed awake
but now these nights look different
the colors dyed another way
so you asked me what would i do
if just for a minute i was you
i took every_step
in your heart and in your head
i see what you see
but nothing looks right
you brought me somewhere i’d never be
you carved out your decision
before you took the turn from me
the life we almost lived in
the mornings walking turnham green
so you asked me what would i do
if just for a minute i was you
i took every_step
in your heart and in your head
i see what you see
but nothing looks right
you brought me somewhere i’d never be
i took every_step
in your heart and in your head
i see what you see
but nothing looks right
you brought me somewhere i’d never be
Head up, I’m going down
New paths on old ground
Wildflowers and bird songs
These hours, I feel strong
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
Novel in my hand
Propped up in the fine sand
By a lake in the summer
No name, no number
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
In a dream, on a long ride
On a stream in the sunshine
Eyes closed, with my headphones
Listening to the unknown
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
And the stress it unwinds
To a pulse of true time
And the symbols they rhyme
Pouring out into my mind
I’m here feeling it all
I’m here, big and small
I can do_anything
I can do nothing
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
I am_free, I’m free in my mind
Goodbye, Evergreen
You know I love you
But everything heaven-sent
Must burn out in the end
I promised you
Just as you were in my dream
Now let me off easy
And I’ll slip down through the drain
To release my scattered brain
My enemy
Something just isn’t right
I cut from the inside
I’m frightened of the end
I’m drowning in my self-defense
Now punish me
Think of me as what you will
I grow like a cancer
I’m pressed out in the rain
Deliver me from the poisoned pain
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.
I looked over Jordan, what do I see,
Coming for to carry me home.
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

I remember it well
The first_time that I saw
Your head around the door
Cause mine stopped working
I remember it well
There was wet in your hair
I was stood in the stairs
And time stopped moving
I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Cause I can't believe
what I found
I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Nothing is taking me
down down down
I remember it well
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing
I remember it well
I was stood in your line
And your mouth
your mouth your mouth
I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Cause I can't believe
what I found
I want you hear tonight
I want you hear
Nothing is taking me
down down down
Except you my love
Except you my love
Come all ye lost
Dive into moss
I hope that my sanity
covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper mach
Come all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This_is love this is porn
God will forgive me But I
I whip myself scorn scorn
I wanna hear
what you have to say about me
Hear

what you have to say about me
Hear

What the hell do you want
Here I am
everyday since you said

So when will I see
your_face again
When will you
touch my life again ohh yeah

Little thing like the rain

Help but wish I could see your_face
And I knew from the first note played

You smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row

And you'll_never see

Every night from the radio
So_dim that spotlight

I'm no_one special
just another wide_eyed girl
Who's_desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall superstar
Sweet sweet superstar
Superstar
She_said sing your song, Sweet Music Man
'Cause I won't be there to hold your hand
Like I used to, I'm thru with you
You're a hell of a singer and a powerful man
But you surround yourself with people who demand, so little of you.
You touched my soul, with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along
Right with you, and said I need you
Then you changed the words and added harmony
Sang the song you had written for me, to someone new.
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody_else could make me sing_along
Nobody_else could make me feel
That things are right, when I know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you.
She_said sing your song, Sweet Music Man
You travel the world with a six-piece band
That does for you, what you ask 'em to
And you try to stay young, but the songs are sung
So_many people have all begun, to come_back on you.
So, sing your song, sad music man
You're makin' your livin', doin' one night stands
It proves to you, they don't need you
You're_still a hell of a singer, but a broken man
But you keep on a-lookin' for one last fan, to sing to.
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody_else could make me sing_along
Nobody_else could make me feel
That things are right when they're wrong, with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you.
She_said sing your song, Sweet Music Man, I believe in you.
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright or in the darkest night
no_one knows she comes and goes
* Good bye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
at such a cost
* Repeat
"There's no time to lose"
I need her say
Catch your dreams
Before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?
*Repeat
Both Sides Now Bows and flows of angel hair
굽이쳐 흘러내리는 천사의 머리카락
And ice cream castles in the air
그리고 하늘에 떠 있는 아이스크림 성
And feather canyons everywhere
여기저기 자리잡은 깃털 모양의 협곡들
I've_looked at clouds that way
난 구름을 그렇게 봤었지요
But now they only block the sun
하지만 이제 구름은
태양을 가리는 존재일 뿐이에요
They rain and snow on everyone
모든 사람에게 짓궂게 비와 눈을 뿌리는...
So_many things I would have done
많은 일을 하려고 했지만
But clouds got in my way
구름이 날 방해했죠
I look_at clouds from both_sides now
난 이제 구름의 양면을 다 보아요
From up and down, and still somehow
또 아래 위로도요, 하지만 아직도 어쩐지
It's clouds' illusions I recall
기억나는 것은 구름이 주는 착각이죠
I really don't know clouds at all
정말 구름이 뭔지 잘 모르겠어요
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
달님과 싱그러운 유월 그리고 유원지의 회전 관람차
The dizzy dancing way you feel
춤추듯 어지러운 기분이죠
When every fairy_tale comes real
모든 동화 속 이야기가 현실로 나타나는 것처럼
I've_looked at love that way
나는 사랑을 그렇게 아름다운 것으로 보아왔죠
But now it's just another show
하지만 이젠 사랑은 단지
또 하나의 연극에 지나지 않아요
You leave them laughing when you go
떠날 땐 사람들이 웃을 수 있게 하세요
And if you care, don't let_them know
그들을 배려한다면 그들이 모르도록 해요
Don't give yourself away
본심을 드러내지 마세요
I look_at love from both_sides now
난 사랑의 양면을 생각하게 됐어요
From win and lose and still somehow
주고 받는 것에대해 그렇지만 여전히
It's love's illusions I recall
생각나는 것은 사랑이 주는 오해입니다
I really don't know love at all
사랑이 뭔지 정말 모르겠어요
Tears and fears and feeling proud
눈물과 두려움, 또
To say I love you cried out_loud
'사랑해'라고 바로 큰 소리로 외칠 수 있는 자신감
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
미래에 대한 꿈과 계획, 서커스의 구경꾼들
I've_looked at life that way
나는 인생을 그런 식으로 보아왔죠
But now old friends are acting strange
하지만 이제 오랜 친구들이 낯설게 행동하네요
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
설레설레 머리를 저으며 나더러 변했다는 거예요
Well, something's lost, but something's gained
하지만 잃는 것도 있고 얻는 것도 있는 거죠
In living every day
하루 하루의 삶은 말이죠
I look_at life from both_sides now
나는 이제 인생의 양면을 봅니다
From win and lose, and still somehow
얻기도 하고 잃기도 하는, 하지만 여전히
It's life's illusions I recall
생각하게 되는 것은 삶의 기만적인 모습이죠
I really don't know life at all
인생이 뭔지 정말 모르겠어요
A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an_island
I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need for friendship
Friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock
I am an_island
Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I'd never loved,
I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an_island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no-one and no-one touches me
I am a rock
I am an_island
And the rock feels no pain
And an_island never cries
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
'Twas grace that
taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers
toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace that
brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home
When we've_been there
ten_thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
to sing God's praise
Than when we first began
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
I fell in love with you
The first_time I looked into
Them there eyes
Cause you have a certain
Little cute way of
flirting with
Them there eyes
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm falling no stalling
In a great_big way for you
My heart is jumping
You started something with
Them there eyes
You better look out
Little brown_eyes
If you're wise
They sparkle
they bubble
Gonna get you in a
whole lotta trouble
Ooh baby them there eyes
I fell in love with you
The first_time I looked into
Them there eyes
Cause you have a certain
Little cute way of
flirting with
Them there eyes
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm falling no stalling
In a great_big way for you
My heart is jumping
You started something with
Them there eyes
You better look out
Little brown_eyes
If you're wise
sparkle
bubble
Gonna get you in a
whole lotta trouble
Ooh baby them there eyes

Uh oh_oh
Once_upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
When I caught your eye
we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please_tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare_at the phone
and he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me
to the core Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
But I don't anymore
And I stare_at the phone
and he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said
forever and always
Oh and it_rains in your_bedroom
everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby
I don't think so
Oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything
Back up baby back up did you
forget everything
'Cause it_rains in your
bedroom everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
Oh I stare_at the phone
and he still_hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when we said
forever and always
And it_rains in your_bedroom
everything is wrong
It_rains when you're here
and it_rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said
forever and always
You didn't_mean it baby you said
forever and always
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
most of my days i spend alone
A_thousand miles
from the place i was_born
But when she_wakes me
she takes me back home
Now most days
i spend like a child
Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind
I know there aint nothing out there
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
most of my days a i spend alone
A_thousand miles
the place i was_born
When she_wakes me
she takes me back home
A_thousand miles
the place i was_born
When she_wakes me
she takes me back home
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
most of my days i spend alone
A_thousand miles
from the place i was_born
When she_wakes me
she takes me
Ya when she_wakes me
she takes me back home
When she_wakes me
she takes me back home
When she_wakes me
she takes me back home
Hold on this will
Hurt more_than anything has before
What it was what it was what it was
I've brought this on us
More_than anyone could ignore
What I've_done
what I've_done what I've_done
I've worked for so long
Just to see you mess around
What you've_done
what you've_done what you've_done
I want back the years that you took
When I was young
I was young I was young
But it's done
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
We'll fall just like stars
being hung by only string
Everything everything here is gone
No map can direct how
To ever make it home
We're alone we're alone we're alone
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
He says he's not afraid to love me
So why am I
I picture everything going smooth as can be
but that's a lie
And it always ends up
That it's always my fault
cause I always mess up
and it's you that I call
Who forgot to mention that
love isn't always a walk in the park
Who misplaced the memo
and now you've_got me wandering around
in the dark
I don't want to go very far_from you
you've gotta know that I'm learning too
to fall and get back up
Oh he's the only one I want to be with
that's not the problem
It's more of it's too_far
and who's gonna drive the car
hush our pretty_little lips
to these pretty_little fits and
Better days out weigh the bad ones
what we have only happens once
Who forgot to mention that
love isn't always a walk in the park
Who misplaced the memo
and now you've_got me wandering around
in the dark
I don't want to go very far_from you
you've gotta know that I'm learning too
to fall and get back up
Well they forgot to mention
in the mail that
This isn't free and there are strings
but I've gotta say that you're the best_thing that has
happened to me since 19 something
Love is sweet with a side of bitter
I'm in love so I'm doing better
Still the question remains
Who forgot to mention that love
isn't always a walk in the park
Who misplaced the memo
and now you've_got me wandering around
in the dark
I never liked the dark
Hang on just hang
on for a minute
I've got something
to say
I'm not asking you
to move on or
forget it
But these are
better days
To be wrong all
along and admit
is not amazing grace
But to be loved
like a song
you remember
Even when you've
changed
Tell me did I
go on a tangent
Did I lie through
my teeth
Did I cause you
to stumble on
your feet
Did I bring shame
on my family
Did it show when
I was weak
Whatever you see
that wasn't me
That wasn't me
that wasn't me
When you're lost
you will toss
every lucky coin
you'll ever trust
And you will hide
from every god
like he never
turns his back
on us
And you will fall
all the way to the
bottom and fall
on your own knife
But you'll learn
who you are even
if it doesn't
take your life
Tell me did I go
on a tangent
Did I lie through
my teeth
Did I cause you
to stumble on
your feet
Did I bring shame
on my family
Did it show when
I was weak
Whatever you see
that wasn't me
That wasn't me
that wasn't me
But I want you to
know that you'll
never alone
I wanna believe do
I make myself a
blessing to everyone
I meet
When you fall
I will get you on
your feet
Do I spend time
with my family
Did it show when
I was weak
When that's what
you see that
will be me
That will be me
that will be me
That will be me
"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear.
She'll put on her make-up and brushes her long_blonde hair.
And then she_asks me, ""Do I look all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight.""
We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me.
And then she_asks me, ""Do you feel all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight.""
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes.
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how_much I love you.
It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head,
So I give her the car_keys and she helps me to bed.
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light,
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight.
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight.""
"
Listen to the river
Does it make you wonder
How anything could ever stand still
First lightning then thunder thunder
A kiss in the rain love
Feel the thrill
Сhorus
I only want you
I only want you
I want what we had
I only want you
I only want you
It's as simple as that
Run to the forest
You'll find some shelter
Remember how we fell in love so sweet
You said watch your step
Walk softer softer
'Cause dreams are growing beneath our feet
Сhorus
I only want you
I only want you
I want what we had
I only want you
I only want you
Can we get it back
I only want you
I only want you
I want what we had
I only want you
I only want you
It's as simple as that
Yours is the best love
It's the best love
So pure and so true
Our love will lift us
Our love will lift us
Only love my darling
Only you
When I do not feel inspired
I can only speak my heart
I'm sitting in the middle_of a fire fire
And I can't even catch a spark
Сhorus
I only want you
I only want you
I want what we had
I only want you
I only want you
Can we get it back
I only want you
I only want you
I want what we had
I only want you
I only want you
It's as simple as that
Smoke in my lungs
I'm dead and gone
I was alive but the feeling has gone
Wish I can feel again
I'm on my own
Just throwing stones in to the water
But they don't know how to float
Wish I could breathe again
I was in the ground
and the space don't feel the same
I was looking down
And she said my love could change
What are you waiting_for
She_looks in my eyes
Felt like the first_time
I saw a sunrise
Said what you waiting_for
She let the fire burn
As the world_turns
She_said don't let go
I said Geronimo
She's in my bones
It's in the air
It's in her stare
I try to touch it
As I watch it disappear
Are you really here
Cause I don't know
If I can go
Such a long time without
Seeing you again
Do you remember when
I was in the ground
and the space don't feel the same
I was looking down
And she said my love could change
She_looks in my eyes
Felt like the first_time
I saw a sunrise
Said what you waiting_for
She let the fire burn
As the world_turns
She_said don't let go
I said Geronimo
She_looks in my eyes
Felt like the first_time
I saw a sunrise
Said what you waiting_for
She let the fire burn
As the world_turns
She_said don't let go
I said Geronimo
She's in my bones
I was living in the dark
Couldn't feel my heartbeat
I was living the dark
Til the light you gave me
I was looking down
And she said my love has_changed
What are you waiting_for
She_looks in my eyes
Felt like the first_time
I saw a sunrise
Said what you waiting_for
She let the fire burn
As the world_turns
She_said don't let go
I said Geronimo
She_looks in my eyes
Felt like the first_time
I saw a sunrise
Said what you waiting_for
She let the fire burn
As the world_turns
She_said don't let go
I said Geronimo
She's in my bones
There's a road I'd like to tell you
about, lives in my hometown
Lake_Shore Drive the road is called
and it'll take you up or down
From rats on up to riches,
fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way
help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with
a heavenly grace help you right on by
And there_ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running_south on Lake_Shore Drive
heading_into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday_night trouble_bound
And it starts up north from Hollywood,
water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up,
throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green
if your mind is feeling fine
There_ain't no finer place to be
than running Lake_Shore Drive
And there's_no peace of mind or
place you see riding on Lake_Shore Drive
And there_ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running_south on Lake_Shore Drive
heading_into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD,
Friday_night trouble_bound
And it's Friday_night and you're
looking clean,
too early to start the rounds
A ten-minute ride from the Gold Coast
back, make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning
and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake
Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning
time, tomorrow is another day
Woo
And there_ain't no road
just like it anywhere I found
Running_south on Lake_Shore Drive
heading_into town
Just snaking on by on LSD,
Friday_night trouble_bound
I just think you should know
I’ve_been broken I’ve_been alone
And I was thinking you should know
I’ve given some heart away before
But I’ve got this feeling
You’re the one I’m waiting_for
you’ve got me fallin boy I’m all in
If there’s any love left
In these old_bones of mine
It’s yours
It’s yours
If there’s any love left in these
old_bones of mine
It’s yours
It’s yours
I was thinking
we should take it slow
cuz we’ve got some distance
we could go
and I’ve_been looking
for a way
to show this isn’t
what I’ve felt before
But I’ve got this feelin
you’re what I’ve waited for
you’ve got me fallin
girl I’m all in
If there's any love left
In these old_bones of mine
It's yours
It's yours
If there's any love left
In these old_bones of mine
It's yours
It's yours
And just so you know
I'm not perfect
I've got a long way to go
That makes two just so you know
Cuz I'm tired_of runnin
Your my coming_home
But I've got this feelin
You're the one I'm waiting_for
You've_got me fallin girl boy
I'm all in
If there's any love left
In these old_bones of mine
It's yours
It's yours
If there's any love left
In these old_bones of mine
It's yours
It's yours
If there's any love left
In these old_bones of mine
It's yours
It's yours
If there's any love left
In these old_bones of mine
It's yours
It's yours
In the dark in the quiet now
It's too_much for me to take
To feel alone
as if there's_no way out
Oh give me piece_of mind today
When the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
In the dark every lights gone out
And there's_nothing left to see
I hear her voice
softly calling out
To go the depth and feel the wait
And the nights are long
And the days go on
I don't feel the same anymore
And the nights are long
And the days go on
And you feel like home
By the window in me
I climb up to be astounded
By the window of the sea
I climb up, I may have found it
But I was lost, I was bored
By the thought of wanting_more
But I was lost, I was bored
By the thought of wanting_more
I demand you
Be here with me, a light in the quiet of the morning
Be here with me, alive in the quiet of the morning
Am I supposed to let you know
Am I supposed to let you go
And be free babe
I know you're no good for me

You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume
is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your
hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
But you won't be_surprised
It happens_every time
It's nothin' new
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank_God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look_at me
with those eyes

Starin'_at you standin'_there

What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you
is all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know
that you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've_been in a daze
Ever_since the day that we met
You take the breath
out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words
out of my mouth
without even tryin'
And I'm_speechless
Starin'_at you standin'_there
in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know that
you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room

After all this time I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room

Oh you know it baby
Mmm
I've_seen much more_than most
Much less than some
Took a while to give up a ghost
Thought it'd never come
There were times
blood on my hands and I
Tried to wash_away
Outside the lines I couldn't stand
Without a soft voice to say
That I'm here I'm here
Right now right_now
Not lost not lost but found
And everything I've_done
Has brought me to you
I got a scar I don't try to hide it
It's forever mine
Got a heart so long to find it
Can't remember why
You'll never know what you can be
Till ya come to realize
In the rearview all that has hurt you
It's just a passerby
'Cause you're here I'm here
Right now right_now
Not lost not lost but found
And everything I've_done
Has brought me to you
Now I hold my head_high
You can see it in my eyes
I won't turn away
If the darkness_comes I'll stay
I'll stay
'Cause I'm here I'm here
Right now right_now
Not lost not lost but found
And everything I've_done
Has brought me to you

Not lost not lost but I'm found
And everything I've_done

My honey likes
the sunshine on her face
I wish that I could
blow the clouds away
But I don't have lungs
big enough today
Not even for goodbye
And she_wants to fly far_away
To a bluer sky and sunny days
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
She_knows
that I prefer my ocean grey
That way that it
moves on stormy days
She doesn't have
a heart to make it rain
Not even for to cry
And she_wants to fly far_away
To a bluer sky and sunny days
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Oh, I miss her so
Indigo submerged in gold
Glowing brighter
than the daylight with
Undertones of gloomy night skies
It's so calm and yet so harsh
How the shades fell on her body
While she is washed away slowly
There_is not much that I know
What's going on below
That skin she scared
can't be undone
They told me I should go
Far and far_away from the girl
who fell in love
With the sun
She's a writer once a fighter
Saved her heart
from being slaughtered but
Wasted words on former lovers
And from time to time
she keeps telling herself
it's fine
Like petals holding on to flowers
She's kept away
from daylight for hours
When the demons take control
The cigarette she holds
No longer be her kind_of fun
Oh maybe I should go cos'
I could fall in love with the girl
who fell in love
With the sun
But then I
Can't complain she keeps me sane
You need to sunk a while beneath
To crave the air
you always breathe
Pulverised yet so divine
Heavy clouds ready to break
she is
Yearning for the ocean to embrace
In my arms where she'll feel safe
All of her mistakes
For once feels_like
it's been undone
Oh little did I know
I have fell in love with the girl
who fell in love
With the sun
I have fell in love with the girl
who fell in love with the sun
I have fell in love with the girl
who fell in love with the sun
Dame with eyes of green
Legs lie soft on the sand beside the sea
With tilted shades, beaming eyes they looked_at me
As if to say, “pull in your reel, pretty boy, and stop lookin’ this way”
But, ooo I love it
When you talk to me like you do
Oh, my lady by the sea,_come and lie_next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea,_come and lie_next to me
Your voice it blooms the flowers on the beach
With lips that glisten in the moon light every_time you speak
A somber tone of men I’ve known, bein lonely, oh, so lonely
But, Luckily, luckily she’s got her eyes on me
But, ooo I love it
When you talk to me like you do
Oh, my lady by the sea,_come and lie_next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea,_come and lie_next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea,_come and lie_next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea,_come and lie_next to me

If you want to do the most I can turn you to a ghost ya
Pick a bone pick a number

Acting grown feeling lucky

Please just let me stay right there a little_bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go

So baby, let's just stay_here tonight, tonight

I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in
Verse_2
It is always nice to see you, says the man behind the counter
To the woman_who has come in,_she is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them, and instead I pour the milk
Verse 3
I open up the paper, there's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking, it was no_one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking_for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head
Verse 4
There's a woman on the outside looking inside, does she see me
No, she_does not really see me 'cause she_sees her own reflection
And I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet
Verse 5
Oh, this rain, it will continue through the morning as I'm listening
To the bells of the cathedral
I am thinking of your voice
Verse 6
And of the midnight picnic once upon a time before the rain began
And I finish up my coffee
And it's time to catch the train
Outro
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

All just to see your hands jumpin' at the concert, yeah

And I love a little whiskey in my hand
Make it disappear then reappear again
Matter fact, I never want this life to end
Until the end Yeah
Verse_2
The voices in my head, they used_to make me wanna break down
Had me hella weighed down
Had me in a corner, had me beat but I'm okay now
True to what they say, if there's a will, then there's a way out
Took all of my dreams, I took 'em back 'cause I'm awake now, yeah

Used to dream about buying that bigger house, sitting on top of some hill
Losing sleep about filling my bank account, wondering if I ever will
But the older I get, I just care less and less 'bout keeping up with people named Jones
If you don't fill it up with somebody that you love, it ain't ever gonna feel like home
There's always gonna be a higher_high
You could chase for the rest_of your life
Greener_grass in the yard_next door
Or a shined up Chevy little_newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an_empty cup if what you got's_still not enough
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
I can hear the kids making little footsteps, running down the hallway upstairs
I can see the dogs playing in the back yard, through the kitchen window right there
Maybe life's kinda more 'bout a swing on the porch, holding her while the sun disappears
Why would I wanna be anywhere else in the world when my whole_world is sitting right here?
There's always gonna be a higher_high
You could chase for the rest_of your life
Greener_grass in the yard_next door
Or a shined up Chevy little_newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an_empty cup if what you got's_still not enough
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
No-no, no-no, no-no
There's always gonna be a higher_high
You could chase for the rest_of your life
Greener_grass in the yard_next door
Or a shined up Chevy little_newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an_empty cup if what you got's_still not enough
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
Mm-hmm
Did you ever make it back to El Dorado
I’d call and ask but hell if I know
If I still got your number or if you care
You moved away when you was younger
Was it escape or was it hunger
Kansas ain’t no place to be a man
You used_to say you’d settle_down
With that kind girl from school in town
She was gone before you got back home
To El dorado hell if I know
If you’re still alive
There’s a note in the glovebox of your drive
El Dorado hell if they know
The difference in a year
And a man I wish was still by my side
17 years old how our grins look scary brave
My momma always said we look so handsome when we shave
You used_to say if not you then who
And you’d go a thousand times or_two
Now your names up on a sign in el dorado driving through
In El dorado hell if I know
If you’re still alive
There’s a note in the glovebox of your drive
El Dorado hell if they know
The difference in a year
And a man I wish was still by my side
You’re in every last memory alive
And I called last week to talk
To my favorite old devil dog
They told he had finally headed home
'Til I'm brave enough to call you
I just fall through every_time
I wish I'd waved when I saw you
I just watched you passing by
So much coming_through, every_hour too
Can't_get enough of you
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You gave me no answers
Nor asked me to lie
You just gave me an amethyst
From your jeweled vest as you cried
So much coming_through, every_hour too
Can't_get enough of you
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You come_around, I'm_ruined
So much coming_through, every_hour too
Can't_get enough of you
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You come_around, I'm_ruined
We shared in the basement
As the fern bent to the window
And we drew to alignment
As the water soaked the pillow
So much coming_through, every_hour too
Can't_get enough of you
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You come_around, I'm_ruined
So much coming_through, every_hour too
Can't_get enough of you
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You come_around, I'm_ruined
So much coming_through, every_hour too
Can't_get enough of you
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You come_around, I'm_ruined
So much coming_through, every_hour too
Can't_get enough of you
You come_around, I'm_ruined
You come_around, I'm_ruined
So much coming_through, every_hour too
You come_around, I'm_ruined
For these_words
he won't come around here
And his eyes won't see
And you know
he won't come around here
He needs it to be
It's like something evil
is taking a hold
nothing deep here
It's like we're losing
our sense of home
Just dissapear
Just dissapear
Tell your mother you're leaving here
Tell your brother you're going away
Tell your mother
she needs to reassure herself
And this will be the only way
Sometimes he tries to reassure
himself
That it's all still there
Almost times he just cries to himself
Sunk deep into his chair
Tell your brother
you're listening to his dreams
Tell your sister she is all you need
Tell your mother she is the only one
And your father has made
you all that you've become
cause these_words
aren't meant for anyone else
but your family
Tell your brother
you're listening to his dreams
Tell your sister she is all you need
Tell your mother she is the only one
And your father has made you
all that you've become
And your father has made you
all that you've become
Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go
He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one_more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watch him fall down as the morning sun rose
He looked_at me
He said You missed my heart
You missed my heart
You got me good
I knew you would
But you missed my heart
You missed my heart
Were his last words before he died
Looking out the window up at the blue_sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost control
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
Underneath the whimpering I could hear the siren sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I miss
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin when she started laughing
While I clenched down on her wrists, she said That's quite a list
But there's one_thing you missed
You missed my heart
You missed my heart
That's quite a list
But what you really missed
You missed my heart
You missed my heart
That's quite a list
But what you really missed
Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policeman on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose but I failed and I broke loose
I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rights
And just before everything went dark
I said, You missed my heart
You missed my heart
He got me good
I knew he would
But he missed my heart
He missed my heart
And just before everything went dark
The most poetic dream
Came flowing like the sea
Laying there my life blood draining out of me
A childhood scene, night sky, moonbeams
Fishing with my friends, sitting in the wild reeds
Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting_for the bullhead catfishes to bite
Down river from the Moundsville prison graveyard
Don't even want the attention
But yeah
that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and
she's spinning around yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh I'm in Heaven I swear
right_now
And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind
Look what God_gave her
How perfect He made her
She walks in the room
It's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves
How could anybody blame her
I know she's got haters
But it ain't her fault nah
Look what God_gave her
It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here
this evening
I thought yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building
so hot
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith
Look what God_gave her
How perfect He made her
She walks in the room
It's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves
How could anybody blame her
I know she's got haters
But it ain't her fault nah
Look what God_gave her
Got that look in her eyes
Swear_she fell right out the sky
Yeah I think I've_seen the light
Every kiss I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man I swear I've_seen the light
Look what God_gave her
How perfect He made her
She walks in the room
It's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves
How could anybody blame her
I know she's got haters
But it ain't her fault nah
Look what God_gave her
Uuh uh
UUh look what God_gave her
Look what God_gave her
Uuh uh
Oh yeah look what God_gave her
[Verse_1]
Yesterday, there was sun and there was rain
Beauty in the mundane
And as the light, startled our eyes
We let go of disguise
And now, there's something in the air
And a sparkly shimmer on our skin
Restoring everything within
[Chorus]
Oh
Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel beyond all
[Verse_2]
Hand in hand, building castles out of sand
Reaching for the grand
As willows align, we lose track of time
Head up high, now we climb
[Chorus]
Oh
Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel, beyond all
[Bridge]
A bigger scale the world inhales
As we go
I wouldn't want it any_other way, no
[Chorus]
Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel, beyond all
Dreamy breezy, we go
Easy, easy on our tiptoes
Undercover agents of the other
Beyond gravel, beyond all
If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain
Well the night's forelorn
And the morning's born
And the morning's born
With the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
And that would break
My heart in two
If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain
Baby's with me now
Since I showed her how
To lay her lilly Hand in mine
Who would ill agree
She's a sight to see
A treasure for
The poor to find
If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain
Just before our love
got lost you said
I am as constant
as a northern star
And I said constantly
in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar
On the back of a carton coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your_face
sketched on it twice
Oh you're in
my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink
a case of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet
Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones
that ain't afraid
I remember that time
you told me you said
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine
Cause part you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh you're in
my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink
a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils
and your deeds
And she said
Go to him
stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed
Oh but you are in my blood
you're my holy wine
You're so bitter
bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink
a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
Well Today I'm so weary
음~~ 오늘은 제가 너무 피곤하네요
Today I'm so blue
오늘은 제가 너무 우울해요
Sad and broken hearted
슬프고 마음이 찢어질 것만 같아요
And it's all of because you
이건 모두 당신 때문이예요
Life was so sweet dear
삶은 정말 달콤했지요...
Life was a song
인생은 노래입니다.
Now you've gonna and left me
이제 당신은 날두고 가 버렸으니
Oh where do I belong
오~~ 어찌 하란 말인가요...
And it's all for the love of a dear little girl
그건 모두 한 사랑스런 소녀에 대한 사랑때문이야 ~~
All for the love that sets your heart in a whirl
그건 모두 내 맘을 소용돌이 치게하는 사랑 때문이야
I'm a man who'd give his life
난 나의 생명을 한 소녀를 위해 바칠 수도
and the joy of this world
그리고 세상의 모든 즐거움도
포기할 수도 있는 사람이야
All for the love of a girl
한 소녀의 사랑을 위해서라면 모든 것을.....
And it's all for the love of a dear little girl
그건 모두 한 사랑스런 소녀에 대한 사랑때문이야 ~~

I'm a man who'd give his life
난 나의 생명을 한 소녀를 위해 바칠 수도
and the joy of this world
그리고 세상의 모든 즐거움도

한 소녀의 사랑을 위해서라면 모든 것을.....
Dear Lord

My home may be out on the highway
Lord I've_done so_much wrong
But please

Dear Lord

My home may be out on the highway
Lord I've_done so_much wrong

Autumn leaves are blowing round my feet
winter wind is at my face
crulest stars are staring down
saying that I finally lost this race
Where_did I learn my wanderin' ways
what was I hoping there to find
when did I realize what lay ahead
could no make up for what I'd left behind
Must have been wrong rainbow
I don't see any pot of gold
all I see is a man too old to start again
I had a girl in the summer of my youth
she loved me more and more each day
god only knows why I gave her up
for marrige to that cold cold highway
Never_knew the years to go so fast
never felt my feet so slow
I bet it all on the yellow, red and blues
of a ghost I used_to call my rainbow
Must have been the wrong rainbow
I don't see any pot of gold
all I see is the man too old to start again.
Once I had a child
He was wilder than moonlight
He could do it all
Like he'd been here before
Once I had a child
She was smiling like sunshine
She could see it all
Like she'd been here before
Then I had a child
Took his while like northern summer
And he knows it all
Like he's been here before
When I get home babe
gonna light your fire
All day I've_been thinkin' about you
babe
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms_around you
Hold you close to me Oh

I wanna fill your fantasy yeah

Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No you're everything to me
Ev'rytime I'm with you baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're layin'

My Sweet Lady
Lady, are you crying,
do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time
together was all gone
Lady, you’ve been dreaming,
I’m as close as I can be
I swear to you our time has just begun

I promise I will stay right_here beside you
Today our_lives were joined,

I wish you could know
how_much I love you
Lady, are you happy,

Are there meanings
that you’ve never seen before
Lady, my sweet lady,
I just can’t believe it’s true
And it’s like I’ve never ever loved before
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind
I promise I will stay right_here beside you
Today our_lives were joined, became entwined
I wish you could know how_much I love you
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time together was all gone
Lady, my sweet lady, I’m as close as I can be
I swear to you our time has just begun
Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
마법의_용 퍼프는_바닷가에 살고있다네
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalei
그리고_"하날리"라 불리는_땅에서 가을_안개속을 뛰놀았지
Little Jackie_Paper loved that rascal Puff
꼬마 재키 페이퍼는 그런 장난꾸러기 퍼프를 사랑했고
and brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff
실과 봉랍, 그리고 다른 멋진 물건들을 가져왔다네
Oh, Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
오, 마법의_용 퍼프는_바닷가에 살고있다네
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalei
그리고_"하날리"라 불리는_땅에서 가을_안개속을 뛰놀았지
Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
마법의_용 퍼프는_바닷가에 살고있다네
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalei
그리고_"하날리"라 불리는_땅에서 가을_안개속을 뛰놀았지
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sails
그들은 함께 바람에 물결치는 돛을 단 배를 타고 여행을 했네
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
재키는 퍼프의 거대한 꼬리에 앉아 망을 보았지
Noble kings and princess would bow when there they came
그들이 지나갈때는 고귀한 왕과 왕자들이 머리를 숙였고
Pirate ships would lower their flads when Puff roared out his name
퍼프가 자신의 이름을 포효하면 해적선은 깃발을 내렸다네
Oh, Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
오, 마법의_용 퍼프는_바닷가에 살고있다네
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalei
그리고_"하날리"라 불리는_땅에서 가을_안개속을 뛰놀았지

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
용은 영원히 살지만 작은 소년은 그렇지 않아
Painted wings and giants rings make way for other toys
색칠된 날개와 커다란 반지는 다른 장난감들에게 자리를 비켜 주었네
One gray night it happened
어느 회색빛 밤, 그일이 벌어졌지
Jackie_Paper came no more
재키 페이퍼는 더 이상 오지 않았다네
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
그리고 강한 용_퍼프는 그의 겁없는 포효를 그쳤지
His head was bent in sorrow
그의 머리는 슬픔으로 떨구어 졌고
Grief scales fell like rain
슬픔으로 찬 비늘들은 비처럼 떨어졌네
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
퍼프는 더이상 체리나무 오솔길로 놀러가지 않았지
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be_brave
평생을 함께한 친구 없이는, 퍼프는 용감해 질 수가 없었네
So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave
그래서 강한 용_퍼프는 슬픔에 잠겨 그의 동굴 속으로 들어갔지
Oh, Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
오, 마법의_용 퍼프는_바닷가에 살고있다네
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalei
그리고_"하날리"라 불리는_땅에서 가을_안개속을 뛰놀았지
Puff the magic_dragon lived_by the sea
마법의_용 퍼프는_바닷가에 살고있다네
And_frolicked in the Autumn_mist in a land_called Hanalei

You_must've fallen from the sky
You_must've shattered on the runway
You've brought so_many to the light
And now you're by yourself
There comes a point in every fight
When giving up seems like the only way
When everyone one has said goodbye
And now you're on your own
If you need somewhere to fall_apart
Some where to fall_apart
The rules of cain, the rights you've made
The owls that caw, for those to blame
The broken glass, the fool that asked
The moving arrow to stop
You_must've fallen from the sky
You_must've come here in the pourin' rain
You took so_many through the light
And now you're on your own
If you need somewhere to fall_apart
Somewhere to fall_apart
The ruins of man, the bloody black
The fool that bull the prouder hag
The night the makes the rattle ask
The wolves that follow the outed man
The falling star the way we are
The vern
The rules that never ever multiply
You_must've fallen from the sky
You_must've come here on the wrong way
You came among us every_time
But now you're on your own
If you need somewhere to fall_apart
Somewhere to fall_apart
The call you seek, the basket case
The rules of thumb you have to break
The raging skull, The rag to the bull
The nails that drag in either hand
Well I will make my worker that
I know this place
I know this time
You_must've fallen from the sky
Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Feathers_on my breath
Gentle impulsion shakes me makes me lighter
Feathers_on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Feathers_on my breath
Nine nights of matter
Black flowers blossom
Feathers_on my breath
Teardrop on the fire of a confession
Feathers_on my breath

When i saw you walkin’ in
And my heart started
skippin’ a beat
I was tryin’ to play it cool
But i knew it was true
That nobody would
ever compete
Well first comes love and
then comes
First date first kiss
We were checkin’ off the list
Then you were gettin’ down
on your knee
And you didn’t have to guess
It_was a always a yes
Now there’s 2 less
fish in the sea
Let’s set the date
Let’s hire a band
Let’s cut the cake
Tie up the cans
I love the ring of your name
You’re the ying to my yang
Oh baby let’s give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I’m talkin’ about
tying the knot
Tie it up
Something old
something new
Something borrowed
something blue
And the chairs lined up
in the yard
The i do’s and the kisses
From a miss to a misses
Can’t wait for
forever to start
Let’s set the date
Let’s hire a band
Let’s cut the cake
Tie up the cans
I love the ring of your name
You’re the ying to my yang
Oh baby let’s give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I’m talkin’ about
tying the knot
Tie it up
Tie it up
Invite the town
Let’s raise a glass
and lock it down
Tie it up
Forever bound
Cuz I’m fit to be tied down
When Mama’s kicked
off her shoes
And Daddy’s spinnin
from the booze
And the last song is
finally sung
We can run to the room
Kickstart the honeymoon
Don’t it sound like
a whole lotta fun
Let’s set the date
Let’s hire a band
Let’s cut the cake
Tie up the cans
I love the ring of your name
You’re the ying to my yang
Oh baby let’s give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I’m talkin’ about
tying the knot
Tie it up
Tie it up
Tie it up
Time is such a hungry beast
It swallows all my memories
It makes all smells and colours fade
It takes the ones I love away
La_la la la,_la la_la love
You are my wildest wish come_true
I love the way you love and move me
I had never dared to ask
for this to come and stay and last
La_la la la,_la la_la love
It's not just the two of us, we're three
You, the hungry beast and me
And it's starving but it can't attack
I'll put two saddles on its back
La_la la la,_la la_la love
La_la la_la
We're laughing till we cry
to ourselves we lie
dance in the moonlight
satisfied
Wake_up to the sun
burning while we're young
set fire to our lungs
till what's left is none
We're the wild_ones
curious fools
trapped in flume
We're the wild_ones
raised by the wolves
we howl to the moon
oooooooohh
oooooooohh
War inside my mind
drowning in the tides
fighting for my life
I'm satisfied
Intoxicate my veins
make me misbehave
be my great escape
till we fade away
We're the wild_ones
curious fools
trapped in the flume
We're the wild_ones
raised by the wolves
we howl to the moon
oooooooohh
oooooooohh
We're the wild_ones
curious fools
trapped in the flume
We're the wild_ones
raised by the wolves
we howl to the moon
ooooooooooohh
Tho' you try you can't conceal it
Love has brought us only storms
I can see your eyes revealin'
Your a stranger in my arms
Say goodbye to our romancing
We have lost the flame that warms
Tho' I hold you while we're dancing
Your a stranger in my arms
Ev'ry story has an ending
This_is where our story ends
Please_don't hurt me by pretending
For lovers never can be friends
Thru the years your love will haunt me
And I'll dream about your charms
Still I know you'll_never want me
Your a stranger in my arms
Ev'ry story has an ending
This_is where our story ends
Please_don't hurt me by pretending
For lovers never can be friends
Thru the years your love will haunt me
And I'll dream about your charms
Still I know you'll_never want me
Your a stranger in my arms
Your a stranger in my arms
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no_one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you
Though you might hear laughin', spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget_about today until tomorrow
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey_Mr Tambourine_Man, play a song for me
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you
Chasing down a wild fire
Are you trying to make a cold
liar out of me
You wanna get high
You overcome those desires
before you come to me
I think your mama's kinda sad
And your papa's kinda mean
I can take that all away
You can stop playing it out on me
Me me
She keeps a pen behind her ear
In_case she's got something
she really
really needs to say
She puts it in a notepad
She's gonna write a book someday
Of course the only part
that I want to read
Is about her time spent with me
Wouldn't you die to know
how you're seen
Are you getting away with
who you're trying to be
Trying trying to be
Of course
there's things upon the Earth
That we must really try to defend
A lonely beast a kind heart
Something weak and on trend
I'd do it all for her for free
I need nothing back for me
There no sweeter deed may be
Than to love something enough to
wanna help it get free
Free free
Is there something on her mind
Something she needs to get by
Do you cry sometimes
Do you cry sometimes
You always say you love me most
When I don't know I'm being seen
Well maybe someday
when God takes me away
I'll understand
what the fuck that means
I just know your mama's kinda sad
And your papa's kinda mean
I can take it all away
You can stop playing
that shit out on me
Me me
Is there something on your mind
Something you need to get by
Do you cry sometimes
Do you cry sometimes
I know your mama's kinda sad
I know your papa's kinda mean
I would take it all away
You can stop playing
that shit out on me
Me me
Running from the start
and here we are again
Running from the start
and here we go again
Smile in the smoke
and find something to day
Smile in the smoke
and find something to say
Who the hell are we to start
this chain again
Who the hell are you to break
this chain again
Trying to imagine giving it away
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
Any chance that I could have
something to drink
Any chance that I could have
something to drink
Walking around here
looking_for something
I can get fucked up
on absolutely anything
I'd sweep you off your feet
when you will fall_apart
I'd sweep you off the floor
oh god you're drunk_again
Find it in the light of
somebody else's heart
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
Looking at the stars
I have you to myself
Looking at the stars
I have you to myself
Standing here with you
and thinking of someone_else
Standing here with you
and thinking of someone_else
Blanket on my back I'm cold
I'm cold again
Tryna see your eyes
oh make me warm again
Smile in the snow
tryna find something to say
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is
floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be_surprised
It happens_every time
It's nothin' new
It's always on a night like tonight
I think you can read my mind
'Cause when you look_at me
with those eyes
I'm_speechless
Starin'_at you standin'
there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know that
you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've_been in a daze
Ever_since the day that we met
You take the breath
out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words
out of my mouth
without even tryin'
And I'm_speechless
Starin'_at you standin'
there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is
all that I can do
And I'm_speechless
You already_know that
you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
Yeah baby mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
'Cause when you look_at me
with those eyes
I'm_speechless
You standin'_there in that dress
Girl it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is
all that I can do
Oh I'm_speechless
You already_know that
you're my weakness
After all this time
I'm just as_nervous
Every_time you walk_into the room
I'm_speechless
Oh you know it baby
In Milwaukee
I met a mountaineer
He told me how he'd taken
an_old lady from there
To one of those famous
mountaintops
Where her husband once
had perished and dropped
Being a gymnast
she was in very good shape
But once in a while they
had to stop for a break
To warm their hands
on a cup of java
As he helped her put
on her balaclava
It'd been forty-two years
he had heard
But the man's body was
quite well preserved
From the permanent cold he was
Forever_young forever beautiful
Forever_young forever beautiful
Forever_young
On the way down
her cheeks were redder
Redder than the reddest apple
They set up their tent at base camp
Crawled into their sleeping bags
And she lit a candle
She_said
You should have seen
him in his summer clothes
The short pants
that gently exposed
His calves that spoke
of hidden treasures
Golden ratios unknown pleasures
She told him how their
bodies had together bloomed
The first_time they did it
in her student room
How she had got on top of him
So she could see everything
Reflecting the light off the moon
Forever_young forever beautiful
Forever_young forever beautiful
Forever_young
I feel loved darling I feel used
Nobody makes me
feel the way that you do
And sometimes I sometimes I
sometimes I just can't stand it
Isn't that just the thing
about us
I'm still thinking
you could be the one
But you're always
you're always
you're always taking me
for_granted
I got something
I gotta get off of my chest
I've_been staying up
while you're sleeping in my bed
I don't hate you babe
it's worse than that
'Cause you hurt me
and I don't react
I've_been building up
this thing for months
Oh resentment
I know you better
than you know yourself
And there's a part_of you
that you won't help
You say you can't do it
just do it just do it for my sake
It's a shame knowing
we could be good
That you could treat me better
if you really wanted to
And if you can't do it
for my sake
then do it for our sake
I don't hate you babe
it's worse than that
'Cause you hurt me
and I don't react
I've_been building up
this thing for months
Oh resentment
Don't know how to leave
or how to stay
So I've_been talking to strangers
'Cause I can't talk to you
anymore that way
Did I let you down
'Cause you let me down
But you would never say
that I let you down
But you let me down
you let me down
But I don't hate you babe
it's worse than that
'Cause you hurt me
and I'm more_than sad
I've_been building up
this thing for months
Oh resentment
I feel it coming like a highball train
Barin' down on the end of the line
I see the black clouds following me
Like they're tied to the hands of time
I'm feeling meaner
than an_old bobcat
I got the hammer down
and won't look back
My mind is headed
down a one-way track
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats
I wish I had another day or_two
But I don't have time to kill
You'll probably never
see my face again
Once I make it across the hill hey
I'm feeling meaner
than an_old bobcat
I got the hammer down
and won't look back
My mind is headed down
a one-way track
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats
Mmm yeah
I got to get away get away oh
I got to get away get away yeah
I got to get away get away yeah
Woohoo
Woohoo-hoo hoo
I'm gonna have to burn
the whole_place down
If they try to throw
the brick at me
I'm gonna run from
the things I've_done
'Cause I'm guilty
in the first degree yeah
I'm feeling meaner
than an_old bobcat
I got the hammer down
and won't look back
My mind is headed
down a one-way track
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats yeah
I'm feeling meaner
than an_old bobcat
I got the hammer down
and won't look back
My mind is headed down
a one-way track
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats
I'm leaving_Lonesome Flats
Woohoo
Got a girl from the Southside
got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number
it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back
like Cadillac seats
Body like a back road
drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve
like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow
just as_fast as I can
The way she fit
in them blue jeans
she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out
I don't need no help
Got hips like honey
so thick and so sweet man
And ain't_no curves
like hers on them downtown streets
Body like a back road
drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve
like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow
just as_fast as I can
We're out here in the boondocks
with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
every inch is a mile
Body like a back road
drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve
like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow
just as_fast as I can
I'ma take it slow
Just as_fast as I can
Body like a back road
drivin' with my eyes closed
Got braids in her hair
I know every curve
like the back of my hand
Down the night when the sky
without light becomes one
with the water reflecting
Window lights flashing purple
and green floating high up
and holy above me
I know it's the only way to breathe
Packed tight inside
of a crowd of deadbeats
I enter hypnosis
You circle the squares
I enter hypnosis
You circle the squares
If I die and I come_back to life,
drop me there in the stare
I've_been missin'
All the time ticking past
since I last saw her dance,
maybe that time was nothing
She_knows
it's the only way to breathe
Packed tight
inside of a crowd of deadbeats
I enter hypnosis
You circle the squares
I enter hypnosis
You circle the squares

After my show
I think I’ll pull an all nighter
5am with my friends
In the back of a diner
Finally understand
What petty meant
about the vampires
I could smell the smoke
Now I see the fire
So let me off
Off the ride
‘Cause I have had enough
For one or_two lifetimes
Let me off
Off the ride
No it’s not the thrill
I thought that I would find
Oh we’re all just trying
to make it out alive
I don’t mind
living outta no suitcase
Singing alone
selling my heartbreak
At_least right_here
I’m living my way
And all the rest
I’ll gladly leave behind
So let me off
Off the ride
‘Cause I have had enough
For one or_two lifetimes
Let me off
Off the ride
No it’s not the thrill
I thought that I would find
We’re all just trying to make it
We’re all just trying
to make it out
We’re all just trying
to make it out alive
We’re all just trying to make it
We’re all just trying
to make it out
We’re all just trying
to make it out alive
Let me off
Off the ride
‘Cause I've had enough
For one or_two lifetimes
Let me off
Off the ride
No it’s not the thrill
I thought that I would find
Oh we’re all just trying
to make it out alive
I’m just trying
to make it out on time
One two three
Though we are parting ways
We shall come around to
touch our eyes again
If love is the foundation
If the purpose be to recycle life
I promise I'll bring us to one
Beating heart in the end now
Though we are parting ways
We shall come around to
touch eyes again
If love is the foundation
Purpose be to recycle life
Promise I'll bring us to one
Beating heart in the end
And may you be blessed
with good drink and food
And may your tongue be covered
with a garment of good news
Love is the foundation
Purpose is to recycle life
This_is how livin'
how it really began oh
How it all began oh
How true lovin' began
How true lovin' began
oh hmm-mm
Now love
Love love love
Talkin' 'bout love
Love oh love
God-given love
Talkin' 'bout love
God-given love
God-given love yeah
Verse_1
You are the man that I see when I look into my dreams
I've got to find a way to make it a reality
Every_time I hear you call, there's_nothing else I need
Everywhere I look I see visions of you
You holding me
Pre-Chorus
I thought I could handle
How hard it was to be away_from
The one that I love
Chorus
But who are we kiddin'
Baby I'm missin' you
Who are we kiddin'
Can't_help but missin' you
Verse_2
I will be there when you need me to be there for you
There_is no way we won't find
A way this time too
Pre-Chorus
I thought I could handle
How hard it was to be away_from
Thе one that I love
Chorus
But who are wе kiddin'
Baby I'm missin' you
Who are we kiddin'
Can't_help but missin' you
Bridge
All these nights I can't sleep
All the early mornings
All they do is bring me back to you
All these cold frozen days
All the warm summer rains
All they do is bring me back to you
Outro
Who are we kiddin'
Baby I'm missin' you
Who are we kiddin'
Can't_help but missin' you
Coming out from hiding
Least you know I’m_trying
Is it always hard?
Don’t know how to write this
I should stick to silence
But it breaks your heart
Someone inside right in front_of me
Is staring me down, and he wants to leave
Don’t know how to fight this, I’m not really like this
When you're not around
Cause I’m not easy to myself
It don’t complete me, feeling well
But can I find the change that helps?
Wondering for the rest_of my life
If I’m holding on
Is someone else?
You should be delighted
Lucky that you found it
How was I to know?
That coming out from hiding
Was kinda like rewinding
All the fear that grows
I don’t know how long it had taken me
To worry_about what I could never be
I should never fight it, I’m not really like this
When I just admit
That I’m not easy to myself
It don’t complete me, feeling well
But can I find the change that helps?
Wondering for the rest_of my life
If I’m holding on
Is someone else?
Cause I’ve_been losing so_much time
I’ve_been losing so_much time
I’ve_been losing so_much time
On myself
Don’t know how to write this
I should stick to silence
But it breaks your heart
Coming out from hiding
Least you know I’m_trying
Is it always hard?
Cause I’m not easy to myself
It don’t complete me, feeling well
But can I find the change that helps?
Wondering for the rest_of my life
If I’m holding on
Is someone else?
why this the color a flavour of spring time?
red the color of blood through my veins
blue the color of when you were leaving
tell me, let me know what you feel inside
cause you don't know me by name
you don't know me by name
it's like you don't know me by name anymore
some people say that the path you are choosing
only leads to where you wanna go
and some people say you forgive and forget but
tell me, let me know what you feel inside
cause you don't know me by name
( you don't know_)
you don't know me by name
( you don't know_)
it's like you don't know me by name anymore
anymore
( you don't know_)
blue the color of when you were leaving
tell me, let me know what you feel inside
cause you don't know me by name
( you don't know_)
you don't know me by name
( you don't know_)
it's like you don't know me by name
( you don't know_)
you don't know me by name
( you don't know_)
it's like you don't know me by name anymore
(you don't know_)
anymore
(you don't know_)
There were times I couldn't see it through
But now I can see you
Close my eyes under the midnight sun
Please make me whole as I can be
Although I'm far_from being ethereal
I still believe my heart's pure
I really never meant to hurt no_one
Oh it was never meant to be
[Chorus]
You said "no need to think it through
We've done that many_times
Either find_somebody new
Or love mе like I am
Don't waste my time too long
Just lovе me as I am
In the darkest night
And the bright daylight"
[Bridge]
We gunned a hole through every ridge and slope
So the earth began to bleed
And the sky was wrapped in bittersweet
Tattered maroon colored clouds
[Chorus]
You said "no need to think it through
We've done that many_times
Either find_somebody new
Or love me like I am
Don't waste my time too long
Just love me as I am
In the darkest night
And the bright morning light"
I was away when I heard
The news
My brother called me up
From the damned waiting room
I got a ticket to ride
Back home
My mind was racing
In fear of the unknown
I saw a dry barren land
All looked so lifeless and bland
On my way
Wait up before you cross the lake
Down by the ocean we hoped
To build a house
Tune into the sound of waves
And watch the sun go down
Riding along the open road
In a haze
It only took hours
But felt_like many days
I saw a dry barren land
All looked so lifeless and bland
The road into town seemed so long
The bird's sang a sad sad song
On my way
Wait up before you cross the lake
Verse_1
Mama always said I was_born on the wild side
One foot in the flames and the other trying to walk the line
Can't say I never saw it coming, I could see the warning signs
Mama always said I was_born on the wild side
I guess mama was right
'Cause when the clock strikes midnight
Chorus
Gonna ride the lightning, feel the thunder
'Til the darkness pulls me under
Gonna fly on wings of fire
Pray the good Lord lifts me higher
Singing,_Oh, when they call me home
Singing,_Oh, when they call me home
I'm gonna ride the lightning
Verse_2
Therе's a man in a black coat standing at a crossroads
With a pad in his_hand and a long list of lost souls
They_say he flips a coin forged out of fool's gold
Thеre's a man in black coat standing at a crossroads
I hope he lets me pass by
And I close my eyes
Chorus
I'm gonna ride the lightning, feel the thunder
'Til the darkness pulls me under
Gonna fly on wings of fire
Pray the good Lord lifts me higher
Singing,_Oh, when they call me home
Singing,_Oh, when they call me home
I'm gonna ride the lightning, ride the lightning, ride the lightning
Outro
I'm gonna ride the lightning, feel the thunder
'Til the darkness pulls me under
Gonna fly on wings of fire
Pray the good Lord lifts me higher
Singing,_Oh, when they call me home
Singing,_Oh, when they call me home
I'm gonna ride the lightning
I've_been looking through the windows
Standin' out here in the cold
But I will never want what they've got
Though the world will tell me so
[Pre-Chorus]
They can keep saying
They know the way
But there's a light inside us
They'll see some day
But they can keep thinkin'
They'll pull us in
But there's a new wave comin'
We're ready to begin
[Chorus]
I don't_care what they say
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe you're like me
We're so_much more_than anyone can see
[Verse_2]
We'll find our way, we use the moonlight
Punished by the lonely dawn
We see the wisdom in the quiet
We knew the answers all along
[Pre-Chorus]
But they can keep saying
They know the way
But there's a light inside us
They'll see some day
And they can keep thinkin'
They'll pull us in
But there's a new wave comin'
We're ready to begin
[Chorus]
I don't_care what they say
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe you're like me
We're so_much more_than anyone can see
[Bridge]
We find a happiness in ordinary days
We don't need the things that shine
I'll sit beside you while the birds begin to sing
Reminding us that they're alive
It's just enough to be alive
[Chorus]
So I don't_care what they say
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe you're like me
We're so_much more_than anyone can see
I don't_care (I don't care)
What they say (What they say)
I'm just different and that's okay
And maybe (And maybe)
You're like me (You're like me)
We're so_much more_than anyone can see
We got 'em thinkin'
sometimes you just have to figure_out
to take your life at 17 and turn it upside_down
and all the walls you build don’t make a house
with a heavy heart you make it work it somehow
i learned to love
the touch and go
the let it ride
the take it slow and I know
it’s a miracle
to let the tears run with a smile
and let it last a little while and i know it seems trivial
sometimes the best plans fall out of your hands
i loosen up on what i hold
and now i love the touch and go
sometimes you have nothing_left to give
you wish that you could take it back to ignorance is bliss
and while the water flows under the bridge
you think of all the time you lost
with all the love you missed
i learned to love
the touch and go
the let it ride
the take it slow and I know
it’s a miracle
to let the tears run with a smile
and let it last a little while and i know it seems trivial
sometimes the best plans fall out of your hands
i loosen up on what i hold
and now i love the touch and go
i learned to love

i loosen up on what i hold
and now i love the touch and go
All the dominos are falling
in the way you always
told me that they could
you get sick of things so easy
then you wind up leaving
and you’re gone for good
you say your fine
and that’s all right
i’ve learned to love
the little ways you lie
let me know when
you fall out of love with me
so it won’t hurt so_bad
when you leave
at_least then i’ll expect it
i’ll tell my heart accept it
when you fall out of love with me
all the promises of calling
start to feel like
if you wanted to you would
i get every message sent to me
i can read the room
youre understood
you say your fine
and that’s all right
i’ve learned to love
the little ways you lie
let me know when
you fall out of love with me
so it won’t hurt so_bad
when you leave
at_least then i’ll expect it
i’ll tell my heart accept it
when you fall out of love with me
let me know
when you fall out of love with me
I found myself among the wolves
I couldn't fight them
I found myself among the fools
I couldn't hide, I couldn't from them
I sought a way to set things right
Listened to my own advice
I found a light out in the night
And then I realized
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
I have done wrong that may be right
I won't fight that
I've set things wrong when they were right
I won't hide that
I might be numb but still alive
Waiting_for the morning_light
My fears and pain seem to have died
I've come to realize
Hеy love I'm ready now
Hey lovе I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
I sought the way to set things right
I found a light out in the night
I might be numb but still alive
Waiting_for the morning_light
My fears and pain seem to have died
I've come to realize
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
Hey love I'm ready now
been here before
felt every emotion
from raising the bar
getting disappointed
know this place from inside
i could be the tour guide i know
that’s it’s pointless but i
try, i’ll try, anything i can
just to remind myself that
not good’s not so_bad
oh i’m in a mess
i get sentimental when
things go worse to bad
then they get worse again (but)
i’m taking my first step
i’m rejecting perfect now
gotta stop the hate (hey)
hating on okay
okay’s a belief
it’s even a privilege
and anyway happy
is so overrated
comes and goes whenever
okay’s always there to rely_on
and i know we’ll never say_goodbye
i’ll try, anything i can
just to remind myself that
not good’s not so_bad
oh i’m in a mess
i get sentimental when
things go worse to bad
then they get worse again (but)
i’m taking my first step

I know what it's like to be half dead
And the other half gone out of your head
Time is only mercy
Time, give me time
It's in everything
We all must leave behind
If tomorrow starts today
We'd best be on our way
There's_no time to waste
Only you'll restore my faith
Mistakes I am destined to repeat
'til I get them right
Walk_with me into the wide_open light
Walk_with me into the wide_open light
The wide_open light
You looked_at me and
my skin jumped from my bones
I knew I would never be alone
Bring me your days dust
And if you're staying here,
you'll be staying with me, I trust
If tomorrow starts today
We'd best be on our way
There's_no time to waste
Only you'll restore my faith
Mistakes I'm destined to repeat
'til I get them right
Walk_with me into the wide_open light
Walk_with me into the wide_open light
The wide_open light
Silence always picks up where it left off
Silence always picks up where it left off
If tomorrow starts today
We'd best be on our way
There's_no time to waste
Only you'll restore my faith
Mistakes I am destined to repeat
'til I get them right
Walk_with me into the wide_open light
Walk_with me into the wide_open light
The wide_open light
The wide_open light
Wide open
Dinner with friends
In cities where none_of us live
The face that somebody makes
When you give 'em a gift
Every once in a while
When I wake_up early without trying
And catch a sunrise
The feeling you feel when you're looking at something you made
The layers and ruffles in my favorite pink-champagne cake
My home state of Texas
The sky there and horses and dogs
But none_of their laws
The shape of his eyes
The shape of his nose
The cute way he mispronounces certain words
The smell of his clothes
The things I would miss from the other_side
Intimate convos that go way into the night
The way that the sun on my floor makes a pattern of light
And early in June when the fireflies first start to glow
It never gets old
The shape of his heart
My shoes by his door
He loves me in all of the ways that I've never felt love before
Things I would miss
From the other_side
I don't_care if you never come home,
I don't mind if you just keep on
Rowing away on a distant sea,
'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me.
You cause a commotion when you come to town;
You give 'em a smile and they melt.
Having lovers and friends is all good and fine,
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine.
La_la, la_la la_la la.
La_la, la_la la_la la.
I don't_care what you do at night,
Oh, and I don't_care how you get your delights.
I'm gonna leave you alone, I'll just let it be,
I don't love you and you don't love me.
I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate.
We made a vow we'd always be friends.
How could we know that promises end?
La_la, la_la la_la la.
La_la, la_la la_la la.
I tried to love you for years upon years,
You refuse to take me for real.
It's time you saw what I want you to see,
And I'd still love you if you'd just love me.
I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate.

La_la, la_la la_la la.
La_la, la_la la_la la.
La_la, la_la la_la la.
La_la, la_la la_la la.
Treat me like a fool,
Treat me mean and cruel,
But love me.
Wring my faithful heart,
Tear it all apart,
But love me.
If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' so close to mine
If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' so close to mine
If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on knees,
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah
I guess you don't need it
I guess you don't want me
to repeat it
But everyting
I have to give l'll give to you
It's not like we planned it
You tried to stay
but you could not stand it
To see me shut down slow
as though it was
an easy thing to do
Listen when
All of this around us'll fall over
I tell you what we're gonna do
You will_shelter me my love
And i will_shelter you
I will_shelter you
I left you heartbroken
but not until those
very words were spoken
Has anybody ever made
such a fool out of you
It's hard to believe it
Even as my eyes do see it
The very things
that make you live are killing you
Listen when all of this
around us'll fall over
I tell you what we're gonna do
You will_shelter me my love
I will_shelter you
I will_shelter you
I will_shelter you
I will_shelter you
I will_shelter you
Listen when
All of this around us'll fall over
I tell you what we're gonna do
Hey you will_shelter me my love
I will_shelter you
If you shelter me too
I will_shelter you
I will_shelter you
I'm stranded since I've landed
Always unknown
A riddle now stalks me
I guess I'm on my own
Betray those beliefs
And lose that grin
Don't be yourself, that's a sin
I'll look deep_inside
Find my soul
Where's my road
The road back home
Hang in there that's what they say
Since I left my home
But choose now, choose wisely
The mysteries that roam
Betray those beliefs
And lose that grin
Don't be yourself, that's a sin
I'll look deep_inside
Find my soul
Where's my road
The road back home
They said You're always a zero
They said You'll never be a hero
I can't find te words tonight
Get ready for the news, boy
Welcome to the real life!
Betray those beliefs
And lose that grin
Don't be yourself, that's a sin
I'll look deep_inside
Find my soul
Where's my road
The road back home!
Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine

guitar solo 1
Well I love my baby like the finest wine

Yeah I love my baby, my heart and soul

she's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy
she's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy
How low are you willing to go
Before you reach all your selfish goals
Punch line after punch line
Leaving us sore, leaving us sore
Absorbed in your ill hustling
Feeding a monster, just feeding a monster
Invasion after invasion
This means war, this means war
Someday you'll be up to your knees
In the shit you see
All the gullible that you mislead
Won't be up or it
Where to, will you relocate
Now that it's war, now that it's war
You take a deep_breath
and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your
very_first day
You say hi to your friends
you ain't seen in a while
Try to stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year
and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this
town Hoping one of those senior
boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around
before Cause when you're fifteen
and Somebody tells you they love
you You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling
like There's_nothing to figure_out
Well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know
Who you're gonna be At fifteen
You sit in class next to
a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls
who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon
as we can And then you're on
your very_first date And he's
got a car and you're feeling like
flying And your mama's waiting up
and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancing round your
room when the night ends
When the night ends
Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen
and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around but
In your life you'll do things
greater than Dating the boy
on the football team
but I didn't know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be
wanted Wish you could go back
and tell yourself what you know now
Back_then I swore
I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger
dreams of mine And Abigail gave
everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind
And we_both cried
Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most
anything And you just might
find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who
I was supposed to be at fifteen
Your very_first day
Take a deep_breath girl
Take a deep_breath as you
walk through the doors
I could build a mansion
that is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts
I want and never ask please
I could fly to Paris
it's at my beck and call
Why do I live my life alone
with nothing at all
But when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come_true
when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come_true
I can be the singer
or the clown in any room
I can call up someone
to take me to the moon
I can put my make-up on
and drive a man insane
I can go to bed alone
and never know his name
But when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come_true
when I dream I dream of you
maybe some day you will come_true
Everythime I see your smile
It makes my heart beat fast
And know It's much too_soon to tell
I'm hoping this will last
Cuz I just always wanna have you
right_here by my side
The future is near but never certain
So please stay_here for just tonight
I must a done something right
To deserve you in my life
I must a done something right
Along the way
I just can't get you off my mind
And why would I even try
Cuz even when I close my eyes
I dream about you all the time
I just always wanna have you
right_here by my side
The future is near but never certain
At_least stay_here for just tonight
I musta done something right
To deserve you in my life
I must a done something right
Along the way
And even if
the moon fell down tonight
There would be nothing
To worry_about at all
Because you
make the whole_world shine
As_long as you are here everything
will be alright
I must a done something right
To deserve you in my life
I must a done something right
Along the way
I guess you really did it
this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to
get it back
Wasn't it easier in your
lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful
when you believed_in everything
And everybody believed_in you
It's all right just wait and see
Your_string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
You're_still an_innocent
There's some things
you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live
it all again
You wouldn't be shattered
on the floor now
If only you would sing
what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your
firefly catchin' days
And everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down
to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin'
wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught_up
to you
It's all right
just wait and see
Your_string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
It's okay life is a tough_crowd
32 and still_growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're_still an_innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed_up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never to late to
Be brand_new
It's all right
just wait and see
Your_string of lights are still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
It's okay life is a tough_crowd
32 and still_growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're_still an_innocent
You're_still an_innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost never to like to
get it back
You were in college workin'
part time waitin' tables
Left a small_town
never looked back
I was a flight risk
with a fear of fallin'
Wonderin' why we bother
with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
You remember
we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin'
on the world together
And there's a drawer of my
things at your place
You learn my secrets and
you figure_out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make
my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured_out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is
what I thought about
You remember we were
sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me
for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city
lights on the water
You saw me start to believe
for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Oh_oh oh
And I remember that fight
2 30 am
You said Everything was
slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you
followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by_surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone
You said
I remember how we felt
sittin' by the water
And everytime I look_at you
it's like the first_time
I fell in love with a careless
man's_careful daughter
She is the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back
You made a rebel_of a careless
man's_careful daughter
You are the best_thing
that's ever been mine
Yeah do you believe it
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now
We had a fight last_night
and I called him mad
makes me feel so sad
and I'm so ashamed
He's my only one
I give him all my love
even_though
my mom says no
I just go on and on
No_one's gonna
take him away_from me
Everyday and everynight
I just wanna hold him tight
and make sure
that everything stays right
and everyday and everynight
to dream of him is
my delight and know that
he'll stay with me all the way
He's my only one
I give him all my love
even_though
my mom says no
I just go on and on
No_one's gonna take
him away_from me
Everyday and everynight
I just wanna hold him tight
and make sure
that everything stays right
and everyday and everynight
to dream of him is
my delight and know that
he'll stay with me all the way
Some day I'll toss
all your presents
and bury the letters
left unsent
cause It's bad to do
what's easy
just cause
It's easy and I wanna do
what pleases me but I can't
and the rode she'd rode
around the side of the mountain
with nowhere to go
but the heart
we'd known when
It's leaning and
It's creeping toward being alone
some day I'll find
the mind to mend it
and make dry
these eyes have gotten wet
cause It's bad to do
what's easy just cause
It's easy and I wanna do
what pleases me
but I can't oh no no
and the crow he'd know
Half the grass and no with
nowhere to go
but the heart
we'd know when It's loving
It's leaving towards being alone
and the oats we sow
they can seed on
forever with nowhere to grow
but the heart
we'd know when
It's asking It's exact way
to go to not be alone
She's not coming_home tonight
she says that she's left forever
And you're staying in the house
where she's going to live forever
And the memory’s cruel
it reminds there's_no one new
time is nothing but a lie
if she's not coming_home tonight
And your sleep will never be
as good as it used_to be
when the one you love is gone
when the one you love is gone
While you're waiting_for the sun
the space around you is very quiet
So you breath in close your eyes
you can feel her warmth
inviting you to dance
she's cruel she reminds
there's_no one new
time is nothing but a lie
if she's not coming_home tonight
And your sleep will never be
as good as it used_to be
when the one you love is gone
when the one you love is gone
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
I'm just out to find
The better part_of me
I'm more_than a bird i'm more
than a plane
I'm more_than some pretty_face
beside a train
And it's not easy to be me
I wish that i could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'bout a home i'll never see
It may sound absurd
but don't be naive
Even heroes have
the right to bleed
I may be disturbed
but won't you concede
Even heroes have
the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me
Up up and away away_from me
Well it's all right
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees
I'm only a girl in a
silly red sheet
Digging for kryptonite on this
one way street
Only a girl in a funny red sheet
Looking_for special
things inside of me
Inside of me inside of me yeah
Inside of me inside of me
I'm only a girl in a
funny red sheet
I'm only a girl looking_for a dream
I'm only a girl in a
funny red sheet
And it's not easy
it's not easy to be me
Slowly paddle through the lake
Straight to the very center
Of the darkest water
Where we can embrace
the shadows on the surface
The eyes that look up lifeless
From our twins below
And though your arms
and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost in plunder
My love will be there still
True its chilling to behold
Up close we stumble backwards
Laughing in our boats till
The image sinks away
to someplace far for certain
A land of new suspension
Where someday we must go
And though your arms
and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost is plunder
My love will be there still
And though your arms
and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost is plunder
My love will be there still
I'm going up the country babe don't you wanna go
I'm going up the country babe don't you wanna go
I'm going to some place where I've never been before
I'm going I'm going where the water tastes_like wine
Well I'm going where the water tastes_like wine
We can jump in the water stay drunk all the time
I'm gonna leave this city got to get away
I'm gonna leave this city got to get away
All this fussing and fighting man
you know I sure can't stay
Now baby pack your leaving trunk you know
we've got to leavetoday
Just exactly where we're_going
I cannot say but We might evenleave
the USA 'Cause there's a brand_new game
that I want to play
No use of you running or screaming and crying
'Cause you've_got a home as long_as I've got mine
And you see trouble in her eyes
And you've noticed but only realized
It's not fading however hard you try
'cause it's built in her for all her life
I'm not alone
She_said I'm not alone
And she takes the night bus home
She's not phased by the darkness in her soul
And you barely catch a glimpse of her
'cause she's wrapped tightly hiding in her clothes
I'm not alone
She_said I'm not alone
She_said I'm not alone
And they're strangers and they're walking my way
and I'm talking to myself
Strangers and they're walking my way
and I'm talking to myself
And they're strangers and they're walking my way
and I'm talking to myself
Strangers and they're walking my way
and I'm talking to myself
She_said I'm not alone
She_said I'm not alone
She_said I'm not alone
She_said I'm not alone
You only know
what I want you to
I know everything
You don't want me to
Your mouth is poison
Your mouth is wine
You think your dreams
are the same as mine
Oh I don't love you
but I always will
Oh I don't love you
but I always will
I don't love you
but I always will
I always will
I wish you'd hold me
when I turn my back
The less I give the more
I get back
Oh your hands can heal
Your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice
but I still choose you
Oh I don't love you
but I always will
Oh I don't love you
but I always will
I don't love you
but I always will
Oh I don't love you
but I always will
I don't love you
but I always will
I don't love you
but I always will
I don't love you
but I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will
Climb up the ladder
we found by the lake by mistake
does it really even matter
how we fall
if we all break in the fall I
shake like leaves
before they fall and land by the
lake
where kids climb down the ladder
we found by mistake
it doesn't_matter how we fall if
we all break
You're just a small_bump unborn, in four_months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're scan of my unmade plans
A small_bump in four_months you're brought to life
I'll whisper quietly, I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers_round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers_round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
Oh, you're just a small_bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four_months you'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly, I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers_round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers_round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front_of me
For a_couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers_round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can_wrap your fingers_round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
'Cause you were just a small_bump unborn for four_months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why
[Verse 1: Chris Young]
I walk in on Friday nights
Same_old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell_does it feel like a different place?
[Verse 2: Cassadee Pope]
Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there_ain't much to talk_about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same
[Chorus: Both]
We used_to be the life of the party
We used_to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an_empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
[Verse 3: Chris Young & Both]
They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've_been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times
[Chorus: Both]
We were to be the life of the party
We used_to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an_empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
[Bridge: Chris Young & Cassadee Pope]
Ain't it funny_how a flame like that
Oh whoa, when they think of you]
It can burn when it's in the past
[Chorus: Both]
We used_to be the life of the party
We used_to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an_empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
[Outro: Both]
Oh, they think of you
When they think of me
Baby, baby, oh
When they think of me, they think of you
If I had to summarize You brought something more to life
Winter spring and summer fall
Happy every_time I call
Then time gets in the way
And turns the body strange
You didn't know my face
When I saw you yesterday
Goodbye is really hard to say
I know you'll always stay
Sleeping in my arms
I just can't believe you're really gone
I know you could never be alone
There's_no way to change what's meant to be
But show them everything you showed to me
We were just passing time
Watching the world go by
Those sleepy eyes
Really got a hold on me
In the morning_light
Forget the world outside
Please_don't give up the fight
You still got so_much to see
Goodbye is really hard to say
I know you'll always stay
Sleeping in my arms
I just can't believe you're really gone
I know you could never be alone
There's_no way to change what's meant to be
But show them everything you showed to me
Show them everything you showed to me
I just can't believe you're really gone
I know you could never be alone
There's_no way to change what's meant to be Goodbye is really hard to say
But show them everything you showed to me I know you'll always stay sleeping in my arms
Being with you is easy
Like two butterflies flying in harmony
Nothing surprising or extraordinary
Like listening to the same_old favorite_song repeatedly
Being with you I feel calm
Just Like the sound of birds are singing an alarm
It's the soft touch I'm embracing in my arms
during the fading of the bustling day
with no time
We are as far as the stars and the earth
But I feel the love that lives within me
You are there, I am here
Not in the same place but we share the atmosphere
When our souls share, then all fear disappears
Never feel alone from here, being with you is real
being with you is real
With the feelings that no_one masters
Like the fire dancing in the water
Swaying together
You are there, I am here
Not in the same place but we share the atmosphere
When our souls share, then all fear disappears
Never feel alone from here, being with you is real
being with you is real
being with you is real
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
[Pre-Chorus: Amelia_Magdalena]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, and it comes unstuck
[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic & Amelia_Magdalena]
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
[Verse 2: Amelia_Magdalena]
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New_York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
[Pre-Chorus: Amelia_Magdalena]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, and it comes unstuck
[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic & Amelia_Magdalena]
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
[Bridge: Both, Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any_other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen
[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic & Amelia_Magdalena]
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken_away to the dark_side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
There’s delays on the planes out of eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leaving from
You’ve been stabbed in your back and the rest_of your body
Won’t you tell me where you’re bleeding from
If you need a tourniquet or if you want to turn and quit
Know that I’ll be by your side
You bled your whole soul into things you can’t control
In a world you’ll never satisfy
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughing last week at something I dreamed of
When you finally feel the blood you spill into everybody else
I’ll tourniquet your toes to the ground
Pull you in and hold you tight love you through the heart of night
Spring your kind ass into town
You’ve been playing your guitar from arenas to the bars
Since you were old enough to rhyme a word
But your_face is getting thinner and you’re praying for the winter
and I heard you fucked it up with her
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughing last evening at something I dreamed of
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
She were laughing last evening at something I dreamed of
There’s delays on the planes out of eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leaving from
Used to dream about buying that bigger house,
sitting on top of some hill
Losing sleep about filling my bank account,
wondering if I ever will
But the older I get, I just care less and less
'bout keeping up with people named Jones
If you don't fill it up with somebody that you love,
it ain't ever gonna feel like home
There's always gonna be a higher_high
You could chase for the rest_of your life
Greener_grass in the yard_next door
Or a shined up Chevy little_newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an_empty cup
if what you got's_still not enough
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
I can hear the kids making little footsteps,
running down the hallway upstairs
I can see the dogs playing in the back yard,
through the kitchen window right there
Maybe life's kinda more 'bout a swing on the porch,
holding her while the sun disappears
Why would I wanna be anywhere else in the world
when my whole_world is sitting right here?
There's always gonna be a higher_high
You could chase for the rest_of your life
Greener_grass in the yard_next door
Or a shined up Chevy little_newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an_empty cup
if what you got's_still not enough
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
No-no, no-no, no-no
There's always gonna be a higher_high
You could chase for the rest_of your life
Greener_grass in the yard_next door
Or a shined up Chevy little_newer than yours
You're never gonna fill an_empty cup
if what you got's_still not enough
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
The thing about_happiness I've found is
It don't live in bigger_houses
Mm-hmm

In my stocking even_though we getting naughty all night
That's how we do, how we do,_fancy like
Sundown, and I'm lonely in this house
It's feeling one-dimensional to me
We've been trying hard to figure_out
Give and take and how to be
But don't you see?
I would give you everything that you wanted
And I would never ask for any of it back
And if I could take only as much as I needed
I would take everything you have
Sunrise, and you're lying next to me
Wrap me in your arms like I'm made of glass
I need all your love
Not just one piece
Hoping that it ain't too_much for me to ask
'Cause I would give you everything that you wanted
And I would never ask for any of it back
And if I could take only as much as I needed
I would take everything you have
Don't wanna share
I want it all
All of the time
Tell me right_now
You feel the same
And that you're mine
Baby
Don't you know
I'd give you everything that you wanted
And I would never ask for any of it back
And if I could take only as much as I needed
I would take everything
I would take everything you have
Everything you have
It_feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It_feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's_miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget_about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling_22
Everything_will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything_will be alright if we just keep_dancing like we're
22, 22
It_seems like one of those_nights
This place is too crowded
Too_many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It_seems like one of those_nights
We_ditch the whole_scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's_miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget_about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling_22
Everything_will be alright (ooh) if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything_will be alright if (alright)
We just keep_dancing like we're 22 (oh, oh,_oh, oh, oh)
22 (I don't know about you)
22, 22
It_feels like one of those_nights
We_ditch the whole_scene
It_feels like one of those_nights
We won't be sleeping
It_feels like one of those_nights
You look like bad_news
I gotta_have you
I gotta_have you
Ooh,_ooh, yeah
(Hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling_22
Everything_will be alright if (ooh) you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to

We_ditch the whole_scene
It_feels like one of those_nights
We won't be sleeping
It_feels like one of those_nights
You look like bad_news
I gotta_have you
I gotta_have you
Used to be so easy
to give my heart away
But I found that the hard way
Was a price you have to pay
But I found that then love
was no friend of mine
I should've_known time after time
So long it was so long_ago
But I've
still got the blues_for you
Used to be so easy
to fall in love again
But I found that the hard way
It's a role that leads to pain
I found that love
was more_than just a game
To play and to win
but to lose just the same
So long it was so long_ago
But I've
still got the blues_for you
So_many years
since I've_seen your_face
But you're in my heart
There's an_empty space
you used_to be
So long it was so long_ago
But I've
still got the blues_for you
Though the days come and go
There_is one_thing I know
I've still got the blues_for you
In the twilight glow I see you
이글거리는 황혼녘에서 난 그대를 바라봅니다
Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 우는 그대의 슬픈 눈동자
As we kissed goodbye and parted
우리가 작별의 키스를 하고 떠날 때
I knew we'd never meet again
난 우리가 결코 다시는 못 만날거라는 걸 알았지요
Love is like a dying ember
사랑은 죽어가는 장작불 같아요
Only memories remain
단지 추억만 남아 있을 뿐
Through the ages I'll remember
비록 시간이 지난다해도 난 기억할 겁니다
Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 울던 그대의 슬픈 눈동자를
Now my hair has turned to silver
이제 나의 머리는 은빛으로 변했고
All my life I've loved in vain
나의 모든 삶에서 난 헛되이 사랑을 했나봐요
I can see her star in heaven
난 천국에 있는 그녀의 별을 볼 수 있어요
Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 울던 그대의 슬픈 눈동자를
Someday when we meet up yonder
언젠가는 우리가 천국에서 만나겠지요
We'll stroll hand in hand again
우린 다시 손을 잡고 산책을 할 수 있을거예요
In a land that knows no parting
이별이 없는 그 영원한 세계에서
Blue eyes crying in the rain
빗속에서 울던 그대의 슬픈 눈동자
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I’m not sure I could
They_say time heals everything
But I’m still waiting
I’m through with doubt
There’s nothing_left for me to figure_out
I’ve paid a price
And I’ll keep paying
I’m not ready to make nice
I’m not ready to back down
I’m still mad as hell and
I don’t have time to
go round and round and round
It’s too_late to make it right
I probably wouldn’t if I could
‘Cause I’m mad as hell
Can’t bring myself to do
what it is you think I should
I know you said
Can’t you just get over it
It turned my whole_world around
And I kind_of like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no_regrets and I don’t mind saying
It’s a sad sad story
when a mother will teach her daughter
that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they’d write me a letter
Sayin’ that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over
I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls
My mind's distracted and confused
My_thoughts are many miles_away
They lie with you when you're asleep
Kiss you when you start the day
And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There before the grace of you go I
"Come with me
My love
To the sea
The sea of love
I wanna tell you
How much
I love you
Do you remember
When we met
That's the day
I knew you were pet
I wanna tell you
How much
I love you
Come with me
My love
To the sea
The sea of love
I wanna tell you
How much
I love you
"
Tall dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase
and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes
his fathers ambition
I wonder_if he knows how_much
that I miss him
And I know every_word that you say
You smile and say how are you
I say just fine
I always forget to tell you
I love you I love you forever
I watched_superman fly_away
You've_got a busy day today
To save the world
I'll be around
I watched_superman fly_away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right_here on the ground
When you come_back down
Talk dark and beautiful
He's complicated
he's irrational
But I hope someday
you take me away
and save the day yeah
Something in his deep browns eyes
has me sing
Hes not all bad like his reputation
I can't hear one single
word they said no
You really got places to be
and I'll be old then
I always forget to tell you
I love you I loved you
from the very_first day
I watched_superman fly_away
You've_got a busy day today
To save the world I'll be around
I watched_superman fly_away
Come back ill deal_with you someday
I'll be right_here on the ground
When you come_back down
And I watch you fly
around the world
And I hope you
don't chase some other girl
don't forget don't forget_about me
I'm far_away but
I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking
out the window
Don't forget don't forget
where I'll be
Right here wishing the
flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the card was from you
Cause I loved you from the
very_first day
I watched_superman fly_away
You've_got a busy day
today to save the world
Ill be around forever
and ever here
I watched_superman fly_away
I swear I'll be with you someday
Ill be right_here on the ground
When you come_back down
When you come_back down
I wait here for you 'fore I'm broken down
I'm coming down
This time
'fore my heart bleeds
Far and away where they took you down
I lead them over to your house
Where I'm broken
Down by the people if they let you breath
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Still my heart beats for you
Have become
All I love and all I hoped for
But I must carry on
Always one
Never broken
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Down in the valley where the church_bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Whoa
I am one
I am one
Break story of
peace and love
In a future
Pride sacrifice
Came around
Never broken
Down by the people if they let you breath
Don't give a damn if you still cant see
Traveling down a street that I did not go
Down in the valley where the church_bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Whoa
I am one
Whoa
I am one
I am one
Jingle_bell, jingle bell,_jingle bell_rock
Jingle_bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
[Verse_2]
Jingle_bell, jingle bell,_jingle bell_rock
Jingle_bells chime in jingle_bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle_bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
[Verse_3]
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick_up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle_bell rock
[Verse 4]
(Jingle bell,_jingle bell,_jingle bell rock)
(Jingle bells chime in jingle_bell time)
(Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square)

What a bright time, it's the right time

Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small_town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small_town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men
And I believe to my soul that inside every man, there's the feminine
And inside every lady, there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each_other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy, don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each_other
What do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady, there's a cowboy that wants to come out
And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out
When I call you up
Can I call you love
I won’t keep in touch
That’s_what I’m_afraid of

On the lawn
under the garden wall at home
I heard about palmistry
When the girls
arrived pretending to be seers
Who could tell my destiny
Twenty years now down the road
I'm there again
and see some things have changed
While others stay the same
When I read between the lines
Beyond the fickle finger
of my fate
Time is on my hands
They informed me
that my lifeline was short
And for sure I'd be going soon
Didn't want to die
before I'd reached my teens
So I cried all afternoon
Twenty years now down the road
I'm there again
and see some things have changed
While others stay the same
When I read between the lines
Beyond the fickle finger
of my fate
Time is on my hands
You walk_into the room
People can't_help it
They're staring_at you
Frozen in place
Cause they have never seen
A woman_who shines like a queen
And I can't believe
This stunning creature is dancing with me
Maybe I'm dreaming but what do I care
As_long as the dream is still there
So why are you hanging around someone like me
Nowhere near perfect and I'll never be
I can be trouble and I change moods like
Tides of the sea
But if you feel like sticking around
I'll wrap us up in a globe of this town
And let the snow fall, while I'm kissing you
And look_at those eyes
Bright as two stars fallen down from the sky
Two perfect hands softly gliding around
A tender voice floating in sound
So why are you hanging with someone like me
Nowhere near perfect and I'll never be
I can be trouble and I change moods like
Tides of the sea
But if you're feeling like sticking around
I'll wrap us up in a globe of this town
And let the snow fall, while I'm kissing you
If you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
Then you feel it once again
When your worries fill the air
You look outside your window
And there's a hundred shades of gray out there
But that's the moment I come in
With just another silly song
Here to remind you once again
That not everything is wrong
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
Just for you
Sometimes a day might seem so long
So make it shorter with this song
We'll make the hours dance away like a night at the ballet
Why'd you walk when you can dance around
You hear this tune all through the town
And the birds in the trees
Will be whistling its melody
Whistle its melody
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
For you
For you
For you
I'll be singing just for you
For you
And you you
You you you
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
Just for you
There's a hummingbird singing just for you
For you
This_is where it ends
I been down a few broken roads that I'm tryin' to mend
But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down
[Pre-Chorus]
Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more
[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought_I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet_plane on a clear blue_sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too_much pridе to let that happen again
So this is wherе it ends
[Verse_2]
Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I shoulda walked out that door
[Pre-Chorus]
Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more
[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought_I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet_plane on a clear blue_sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too_much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends, ends, ends
Yeah, this is where it ends
[Bridge]
You're the best_thing that ever happened to me
You showed me what true love shouldn't be
I found myself the second I gave up on us
[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought_I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance (Second chance)
And like a jet_plane on a clear blue_sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too_much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends
Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, and I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
And choirs will be singing Silent Night
And Christmas carols by candlelight
Please, come home for Christmas
(please, come home)
Please, come home for Christmas
(please, come home)
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure_as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear
Some time of year to be with the one you love
So won't you tell me,
you'll_never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll_be no more sorrow (no more sorrow)
No grief and pain (grief or pain)
And I'll be happy, happy once again
Come on home now
Ooh, there'll_be no more sorrow
(no more sorrow)
And no grief and pain (grief or pain)
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
I dreamed I had a good job
and I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade
A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll
No pretty chick is
gonna make me crawl
Get on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman child and man
Gets a Cadillac
and a great_big diamond ring
Don't you know
you're_riding with the king
He's on a mission of mercy
to the new frontier
He's gonna check us
all on out of here
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your
prescription filled
Get on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody clap your hands
And don't you just love the
way that he sings
Don't you know
we're_riding with the king
Riding with the king
Don't you know
we're_riding with the king
A tuxedo and shiny 335
You can see it in his face
the blue never lie
Tonight everybody's getting
their angel wings
And don't you know
we're_riding with the king
I stepped out of Mississippi
when I was ten_years old
With a suit cut sharp
as a razor and a heart made of gold
I had a guitar hanging
just about waist high
And I'm gonna play this thing
until the day I die
Don't you know
we're_riding with the king
Don't you know
we're_riding with the king
Riding you're_riding with the king
You're riding
you're_riding with the king
riding_with the king
Don't you know
we're_riding with the king
just relax my friend
you're overthinking
and even if there is a problem
there's a solution
remember to breathe
put your mind at ease
soon this feeling's gonna pass
you will find relief
I can tell by the way that you're stirrin' your drink
Oh, we're already playin' with fire
Said that you had to go 'bout an_hour ago
Baby, you're such a beautiful liar
It_feels like a movie I've already seen
So right_now I'm beggin' you, please
Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
Give that heartache to somebody_else
If you're the kinda girl
that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby
Now the closer I get to the red on your_lips
I can feel myself fallin' all crazy
'Cause just a little kiss
and I could never get you out of my mind
So before you go wreck my whole_life
Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
(Save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody_else
(Somebody else)
If you're the kinda girl
that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby
Oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I know you know that I ain't strong enough
To tell girls like you no, no it ain't in my blood
So just save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
(Save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody_else
(Somebody else)
If you're the kinda girl
that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby
How come he don't come and P.I.P. with me
Down at the meter no more?
And how come he turn(ed) off the t.v.
And hang(ed) that sign on the door?
Well we call and we call "How come?" we say
Hey what could make a boy behave this-a way, yeah?
And he learn(ed) all of the lines, now, and every_time
He gonna s-stutter when he talks
And it's true! It's true! He sure has acquired this kinda cool and inspired sorta jazz when he walk(s)
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans,
If this ain't healthy it is some kinda clean
That means Chuck_E's in love
I don't believe what you're saying to me
This_is something I got to see. Is he here?
I look in the poolhall. Is he here?
I look in the drugstore. Is he here?
No, he don't come here no more
Well I'll tell you what, I saw him
He was sittin' behind us down at the Pantages
And whatever is that he's got up his sleeve
I hope it isn't contagious
What's her name? Is that her there?
Oh Christ, I think he's even combed his hair!
And is that her? Well then what's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be same.
That's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck_E's in love with the little girl singing this song
Don't you know
Chuck_E's in love, Chuck_E's in love
Chuck_E's in love, Chuck_E's in love ...
Chuck_E's in love with me
It won't do
To dream of caramel,
To think of cinnamon
And long for you.
It won't do
To stir a deep desire,
To fan a hidden fire
That can never burn true.
I know your name,
I know your skin,
I know the way
These things begin;
But I don't know
How I would live with myself,
What I'd forgive of myself
If you don't go.
So goodbye,
Sweet appetite
No single bite
could satisfy...
I know your name,
I know your skin,
I know the way
These things begin;
But I don't know
How I would live with myself
What I would give of myself,
If you don't go.
It won't do
To dream of caramel,
To think of cinnamon
And long for you.
hello,darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
because a vision softly creeping
I left the seeds while
I was sleeping,
and the vision that was
planted in my_brain
still_remains with in the
sound of silence
In_restless dreams I walked alone
narrow streets of cobble stone
neath the halo of a street lamp
turned my collar to the
cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
the flash of a neon
light
split the night and touched
the sound of
silence
And in the naked light,I saw
ten_thousand people maybe more
people talking without speaking
people hearing without listening
people writing songs that
voices never share
no_one dare disturb the sound
of silence
Fools said I you do not know
SILENCE LIKE CANCER GROW
hear my words that
i might teach you
take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words like silent
raindrops fell
and echoed in the walls of silence
and the people bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
and the sign flached out
it's warning
In the words that it was forming
and the signs said
the words of the prophets
are written on the
subway walls
and tenement halls
and whisper'd in the sound of silence
I gave me away
I could have knocked off the
evening
But a lonelily landed my walls
in her hands
In a way I felt you were leaving
me
I was sure I wouldn't find you
at home
And you let me down
Could have knocked off the evening
But you lonelily let him push
under your bone
You let me down
It's no_use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone
You're_coming home
You're_coming home
You're_coming home
You're_coming home
I gave me away
I could have knocked off the
evening
But I was lonelily looking_for
someone to hold
In a way I lost all I believed_in
And I never found myself so low
And you let me down
You could've called if you'd
needed
But you lonelily got yourself
locked instead
And you let me down
It's one_thing being cheated
But you took him all the way
through your bed
And now you're coming_home
And I'm trying to forgive
You're_coming home
And I'm trying to forget
You're_coming home
And I'm trying to move on
You're_coming home
And you haven't called yet
You're_coming home
And I'm trying to forgive
You're_coming home
I'm just trying to forget
You're_coming home
I'm trying to move on
You're_coming home
But you haven't called
You're_coming home
You're_coming home
You're_coming home
You're_coming home
I gave me away
I could have knocked off the
evening
But I lonelily loomed her into
my bone
You let me down
There's_no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone
going down this road again
I finally know
there is no end to the good
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
burning light inside my dreams
i wake_up in the dark
the light is outside my door
l
ove is everywhere_i go
looking through you
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
chasing every fragment i see
looking through you
love is looking_for me
breaking open the clouds
i'm not stranded in time
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
love is everywhere_i go
looking through you
Will that's all right if that's all right
Two thousand_miles but that's all right
And that's all right if that's all right
I'll see you in the morning if that's all right
What would you do if I wrote you a song
would you give me some loving
when I get home
or would you be mad at me if I had a hard time
getting a hold of you, I try all the time
I'll bet that you don't know anybody
that could be so_bad
but if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes
- 간 주 중 -
What would you do if I sang you this song
the connection is bad
but that's only the phone
when my words kiss your ear,
I'll be right there
the message is long because
baby this is your song
I'll bet that you don't know anybody
that could be so_bad
but if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
I'll be home when tomorrow morning
I'll bet that you don't know anybody
that could be so_bad
but if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
I'll be home when tomorrow morning
if that's all right
I'll be home when tomorrow morning
if that's all right
I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned
down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and
I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could
have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away
I've never been the kind
to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong
meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes Tonight I wanna cry
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
"All By Myself" would sure hit me
hard now that you're gone
Or_maybe unfold some old
yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets_better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way -
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for_granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small
When you stand_by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one_more opens
Promise me you'll give fate a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake
But it's worth making
Don't let some hell bent heart
Leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above
More_than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always)
I hope you dance
(Rolling us along)
I hope you dance
(Tell me who)
I hope you dance
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
(Where those years have gone)
I hope you still feel small
When you stand_by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one_more opens
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always)
I hope you dance
(Rolling us along)
I hope you dance
(Tell me who)
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
I hope you dance
(Where those years have gone)
(Tell me who)
I hope you dance
(Wants to look back on their years and wonder)
(Where those years have gone)
I'm 500_miles away_from home
Teardrops fell on momma's note
When I read the things she wrote
She_said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm 500_miles away_from home
Away from home away_from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm 500_miles away_from home
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home,
But it sure looks different now. And I guess I look
Different too, cause time changes everything. I wonder what
They'll say, when they see their boy looking this bad.
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate
It's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still 500_miles away_from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm 500_miles away_from home
Away from home away_from home
Oh I'm still 500_miles away_from home
Some kind_of magic
Happens late at night
When the moon smiles down on me
And bathes me in it’s light
I fell asleep beneath you
In the tall blades of grass
When I woke the world was new
I never had to ask
It’s a brand_new day
The sun is shinning
It’s a brand_new day
For the first_time
In such a long long time
I know
I’ll be ok
Most kind_of stories
Save the best part for last
Most stories have a hero who finds
You make your past your past
Ya you make your past your past
It’s a brand_new day
The sun is shinning
It’s a brand_new day
For the first_time
In such a long long time
I know
I’ll be ok
This cycle never ends
Gotta fall in order to mend
And it’s a brand_new day
It’s a brand_new day
For the first_time
Inn such a long long time
I know
I’ll be ok
in the heat of the fight
i walked aWay
ignoring words that you were
that you were saying
trying to make me stay

with your_face and the
beautiful eyes and the
conversation with the
little white lies
and the faded picture of a
beautiful night
you carried me from your car
up the stairs
and i broke_down crying
was she worth this mess
after everything and that
little black_dress after
everything i must confess
i need you
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've_been giving out
chances every_time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking
we'll be fine again
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did_before
You're not_sorry no no no no
Looking so innocent
I might believe you
if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me
waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired_of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did_before
You're not_sorry no no
You're not_sorry no no
You had me falling for you honey
And it never would've gone away no
You used_to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
There's_nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me
that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did_before
You're not_sorry no no
You're not_sorry no no
I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got a big coat on
I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
And run and run
At the pumpkin patch
The tractor rolls on
The sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall_asleep
The_whole way home
I don't know why all
the trees change in the fall
I know that you're not
scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow
White's house is near or far_away
But I know that I had the best day
With you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean I come home crying
and You hold me tight
And grab the keys
And you drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away And we talk
and window shop Until I've
forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm gonna
talk to Now at school
I know I'm laughing on
the car ride home with you
Don't know how long
it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better_than nothing
I grew_up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There_is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint
set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the edge of princesses
and pirate ships And the
seven dwarves Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady
in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees
change in the fall
And you were on my side
Even when I was wrong And I
love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today
He walked down a busy street
Staring solely at his feet
Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side
Stood at the table where she sat
And removed his hat
In respect of her presence
Presents her with the pictures and says
"These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you.
These_are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you"
Opened up his little heart
Unlocked the lock that kept it dark
And read a written warning
Saying I'm still mourning
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts that broke my heart before I met you
[Chorus]
Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love
He went crazy at nineteen
Said he'd lost all his self esteem
And couldn't understand why he was cry, cry, crying, crying.
He would stare_at empty chairs
Think of the ghosts that once sat there
The ghosts who broke his heart.
All the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts that broke his heart
All the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts,
The ghosts, the ghosts
The ghosts that broke my heart before I met you
[Chorus]
He says "I'm so lost,
Not at all well"
Do as though there is nothing_left to be
Turned out I'd been following him and he'd been following me
Do as though after it was over
We were just two lovers crying on each others shoulders
And I said
[Chorus: x2]
Oh tonight I'm feeling fine
I'm alone just wasting time
No Friday movie nights
Or romantic candle lights
I'm just having conversations
With the thoughts in my head
All I hear are angels crying
Oh won't they just sing instead
It would be wrong for me to say
I don't need that girl by my side
I don't need that girl in my life
I don't want to talk it out
Or hold her when she cries
I don't want to say she's my kind
I don't want to say that she's mine
I don't want to tell her that
I love her more_than life
More_than life Yeah
Love her more_than life
Yeah_yeah yeah
Honestly this won't do
How is she doing I tell myself
I'm feeling swell
But I know I'm such a fool
I could take it as a new_beginning
But you know I don't feel that way
Who will take all this pain away
I know it's wrong for me to say
I don't need that girl by my side
I don't need that girl in my life
I don't want to talk it out
Or hold her when she cries
I don't want to say she's my kind
I don't want to say that she's mine
I don't want to tell her that
I love her more_than life
More_than life Yeah
Love her more_than life
Yeah_yeah yeah
Talk about a sin Was the day
I walked into the other_side
I would run back in
I wouldn't waste no time
I know it's wrong for me to say
I don't need that girl by my side
I don't need that girl in my life
I don't want to talk it out
Or hold her when she cries
I don't want to say she's my kind
I don't want to say that she's mine
I don't want to tell her that
I love her more_than life
More_than life Yeah
Love her more_than life
Yeah_yeah yeah
Wake_up in New_York City
Lying on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's West 54 wow
You gonna know my name by the end of the night well
You gonna know my name by the end of the night well
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
I don't_care no no
You don't_care
Start up with the bottle
End it up with the bottle
Taking shots waiting_for tomorrow
Trying to fill up was hollow
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
I don't_care no no
Cause you don't_care
Get lost in this city trying to find myself
I woke_up with different versions
Came down somebody_else
I know it ain´t right
But its song in my head
Wow I'm surprised
I'm still alive I should breathe in
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
Bright_lights big_city going to my head
I don't_care no no
You don't_care
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name by the end of the night well
While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming
I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night
And I come to her and say
It_was all right, and I hold her tight
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she_sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I can find a way
While she lays waiting
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
And I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting_for me like a secret friend
And there's_no end while she lays crying
I fumble with a melody or_two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she_sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I can find a way
While she waits
While she waits
For me
Girl, I been thinkin'_'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings pilin' up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny_day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey_bee
Yeah, that came out a little country
But every_word was right on the money
And I got you smilin' honey right back at me
Now hold on 'cause I ain't done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just havin' fun, but seriously
If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced_tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey_bee
Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each others arms
I coulda said I love you
Coulda wrote you a line or_two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart
If you'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny_day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey_bee
You'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar baby
I'll be your sweet iced_tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
And I'll be your honey_bee
I'll be your honey_bee
Here comes the flood again
Watch it fall from the sky
Feel it soak through
my flesh and my blood
Feel it burn in my eyes
When I say how_much more can I take
I know the water's rising up
Watch the waves crest and break
And though I may_not make a sound
I fear that I may drown
I fear that I may drown
Here comes the wind again
Cold that cuts to the bone
Pack my bags
and I'll head out the door
Here I am on my own
When I say how_much more can I stand
I know my walls are falling down
I let the rocks who chose the sand
And though I know one left to blame
Still I cursed your name
I cursed your name
So now the end
What I've_been running from
Though I've tried
I cannot lift my head
Oh what have I become
When I say how_much more can I take
I know my time is running short
I am broken and I'm breaking
Though I've worn myself so thin
Coming home again
And though I do not know my heart
But I know myself into my bones
But if my bones should come apart
Then I'll have nothing_left to give
But if you take me in
Coming home again
And if you take me in
Coming home again
Close
Like a little strap
To your shoulder
Close
Like you been
Since you slid over
Close
Like that sun is
To going down
That's what I wanna be now
Close, you know
Baby, we can fly high
Touching heaven tonight
Take it to a place we never been
Baby, we can chance it
First kiss, landed
Diving off the edge
Baby, going all in
Let it go where it wants to go
Yeah, we might not fall in love
But we can sure come close
We can sure come close, yeah
Close
Yeah, it ain't even
Close to midnight
Close
Don't even close your eyes
Close
Like your_lips should be to mine
Ain't_nothing quite like
Close, you know
Baby, we can fly high
Touching heaven tonight
Take it to a place we never been
Baby, we can chance it
First kiss, landed
Diving off the edge
Baby, going all in
Let it go where it wants to go
Yeah, we might not fall in love
But we can sure come close
We can sure come close
Yeah, yeah,_yeah
Let it go where it wants to go
We might not fall in love
But baby we can fly high
And take it to a place we never been
Baby, we can chance it
First kiss, landed
Diving off the edge
Baby, going all in
Let it go where it wants to go
Yeah, we might not fall in love
But we can sure come close
We can sure come close, yeah
Oo oo_oo oo_oo oo_oo oo_oo oo
Here we are again
Fading light
Those gleaming eyes and freckled smile
Light up the night
Here we are alone
My lips on yours
The taste of the candy and salt
Drives me for more
Tied to my heart
with your ballpoint pen
Say you love me again and again
There will never be an end
To this love, my dear friend
You_colour me
You_colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled
with gold
You_colour me
You_colour my soul
Make me dream of things
I never did once before
Here we are again
Telling me it's my fault
Things I don't understand
Things beyond control
Here we are alone
You resting by my side
Those broken glass and shatter mines
Cloud my mind
Before you stab my heart
with your ballpoint pen
Say you love me again and again
There will never be an end
To this love, my dear friend
You_colour me
You_colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled
with gold
You_colour me
You_colour my soul
Made me dream of things
I never did once before
Lipstick stains on these clothes of mine
Hold your scent, frozen in time
Lipstick stains on these clothes of mine
Hold your love, frozen in time
You_colour me
You_colour my soul
Paint me red in places once filled
with gold
You_colour me
You_colour my soul
Make me dream of things
I never did once before
Mr. Tillman good to see you again
There's a few outstanding charges
just before we check you in
Let's see here
you left your passport
in the mini fridge
And the message
with the desk says here
the picture isn't his
And oh just a reminder
about our policy
Don't leave your mattress in the rain
if you sleep on the balcony
Okay did you and your guests
have a pleasant stay
What a beautiful tattoo
that young man had on his face
And oh will you need a driver
out to Philly
Jason Isbell's here as well
And he seemed a little
worried about you
I'm feeling good
Damn I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud above
an_island in my mind
Okay babe
don't be alarmed
this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No it's not too bad a crime
Mr. Tillman
for the seventh time
We have no knowledge of a film
that is being shot outside
Those aren't extras in a movie
they're our clientele
No they aren't running lines
and they aren't exactly thrilled
Would you like a regalo on the patio
Is there someone we can call
Perhaps you shouldn't drink alone
I'm feeling good
Damn I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud
above an_island in my mind
Okay babe
don't be alarmed this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No it's not too bad a crime
The way that it was
Brings me down to my knees
Tell me when it's alright
Tell me when it's alright
Going back to the start
This game that we play
Looking_for a lifeline
I'm running out of free tries
Chorus
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there_ain't no shame in
Admitting_you're lonely
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there_ain't no shame in
Admitting_you're lonely
Post-Chorus
'Cause I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces
Verse_2
I'm losing my words
Forgetting my lines
Knowing all the answers
No more second chances
I'm falling back in
Losing the time
Searching for a way home
But running down a wrong road
Chorus
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there_ain't no shame in
Admitting_you're lonely
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there_ain't no shame in
Admitting_you're lonely
Post-Chorus
'Cause I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces
Bridge
I know how this turns out, don't end well
But I'm keeping you around,_I'm keeping you around
Chorus
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there_ain't no shame in
Admitting_you're lonely
You don't even know me, it's only a feeling
You gotta believe me
Darling, I'm just saying there_ain't no shame in
Admitting_you're lonely
Post-Chorus
'Cause I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces
I'm in pieces
There are times
that walk from you
Like some passing afternoon
Summer warmed the open
window of her honeymoon
And she chose a yard to burn
But the ground remembers her
Wooden spoons her children
stir her bougainvillea blooms
There are things that drift away
Like our endless numbered days
Autumn blew the quilt right
off the perfect bed she made
And she's chosen to believe
In the hymns her mother sings
Sunday pulls its children
from their piles of fallen leaves
There are sailing ships that pass
All our bodies in the grass
Springtime calls her children
'til she lets them go at last
And she's chosen where to be
Though she's lost her wedding_ring
Somewhere near her misplaced
jar of Bougainvillea seeds
There are things we can't recall
Blind as night that finds us all
Winter tucks her children in
her fragile china dolls
But my hands remember hers
Rolling around the shaded ferns
Naked arms her secrets still
like songs I'd never learned
There are names across the sea
Only now I do believe
Sometimes with the
windows closed
she'll sit and think of me
But she'll mend his tattered clothes
And they'll kiss as if they know
A baby sleeps in all our bones
so scared to be alone
Almost heaven, West_Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life_is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Chorus
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home,_country roads
Verse_2
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes
Chorus
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home,_country roads
Bridge
I hear her voice in the morning hour she_calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far_away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Chorus
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home,_country roads
Country_roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West_Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home,_country roads
Outro
Take me home, down country_roads
Take me home, down country_roads
I feel your love
I feel time is up
When I was a child
I never knew enough
what that would do to me
The wave of love
is a transient hut
The water’s the shell
and we are the nut
But I saw a hand arch
out of the barrel
Look_at all the peaches
How do you celebrate
I can’t appearance out of nowhere
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting_wet
Looks_like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
I rushed in to hold down your page
And now I sleep beside words
you do not read with me
And I hear a song
from inside the maze
The very one you made
You shook at the ivory mantel
As a poet I knew to be gentle
When you have child
so begins the braiding
And in that braid you stay
Look_at all the peaches
I want to celebrate
I can’t appearance out of nowhere
Look_at all the peaches
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting_wet
Looks_like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
The wave of love
is a transient hut
The waters the shell
and we are the nut
But I saw a match struck
outside the barrel
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting_wet
Looks_like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
It’s already dead
I know you have dove
I’m not getting_wet
Looks_like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I’m not getting led along
Born and raised on a backroad
Speaker box and a can cold
Saturday we were rebels
But we were angels in church
Beat up boots on the front porch
Rusty roots in the back forty
Nothing's ever meant more to me
than that dirt
Never give it up never turn it down
Same back then as it is right_now
No_matter where I'm at man I know
I got that old_country soul
That boondock swag in my stroll
Rock it wherever I roll
I got that old_country
I got that old_country soul
I wouldn't_trade it for gold
Someday write it on my stone
I got that old_country
old_country soul
I'm a blue ribbon on a PBR
Countin' blessings countin' stars
Memories in a mason jar
That won't let me go
Like an_old guitar
in a brand_new song
Just 'cause you leave don't mean
you're gone
No_matter where I'm at man I know
I got that old_country soul
That boondock swag in my stroll
Rock it wherever I roll
I got that old_country
I got that old_country soul
I wouldn't_trade it for gold
Someday write it on my stone
I got that old_country
old_country soul
It's who I'll always be
who I'll always be
It's every part_of me soul
It's in my bones
my comfort zone that gravel road
That front porch light
that takes me home
Old country_soul still got that
Soul yeah
Everyone wanna sing now
Old country_soul
I got that old_country soul
That boondock swag in my stroll
Rock it wherever I roll
I got that old_country
I got that old_country soul
I wouldn't_trade it for gold
Someday write it on my stone
I got that old_country
old_country soul yeah
that ain't ever gonna change
I got that old_country
old_country soul
We took a damn long drive
You were singing death cab
While I harmonized
Your chest can fall and rise
Moving like a needle drop
On my 45
But I don’t wanna go
I don’t wanna play dead yet
I’ve_had moments
Faked a smile the moment I forget it
Walk a tight rope
Though we’re standing three feet off the ground
You should keep close
Cause we might just make it through the night
Putting up a fight
We could do right
And now at such great heights
I’m not looking down
I won’t split
With every bark and every bite
We could go another round
Or we could call it quits
I don’t wanna go
I don’t wanna play dead yet
I’ve_had moments
Faked a smile the moment I forget it
Walk a tight rope
But we’re standing three feet off the ground
You should keep close
Cause we might just make it through the night
We’re putting up a fight
We could do right
We could do right
Do right
Do-do-do-do
We could do right
Do-do-do-do
We could do right
Do-do-do-do
We could do right
Do-do-do-do
We could do right
(I don’t wanna go)
Do-do-do-do
We could do right…
(I don’t wanna go)
I don’t wanna go
I don’t wanna play dead yet
I’ve_had moments
Faked a smile the moment I forget it
Walk a tight rope
But we’re standing three feet off the ground
You should keep close
Cause we might just make it through the night
Putting up a fight
We could do right
We’re_having a baby
We’re_having a baby
Isn’t it crazy
How much I love this bump
on your belly
We’re_having a baby
We’re_having a baby baby
Isn’t it crazy
How much I love this bump
on your belly
We’re_having a baby
We’re_having a baby baby
Isn’t it crazy
How much I love this bump
on your belly
Oh my god oh my god
oh my god oh my god
Oh my god oh my god
oh my god oh my god
We’re_having a baby
We’re_having a baby
Isn’t it crazy
How much I love this bump
on your belly
We’re_having a baby
We’re_having a baby baby
Isn’t it crazy
How much I love this bump
on your belly
I'd put the whiskey back in the bottle
Put the smoke back in the joint
Look up at the sky and say
Okay okay okay
think you made your point
I'd cover up the pool at Skymont
I'd take some girls out of my phone
Give the nightlife back to Nashville
One night at a time
'til all the regret's gone
And I'd drive a thousand_miles
to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies
could still come_true
I'd tell you everything was alright
And hold you baby all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you
I thought I wanted my freedom
I told myself I'd have a ball
But it turns out going
out and chasing
Dreams and lonely women
Ain't freedom after all
If I could go back now
And take it back somehow
I'd drive a thousand
miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could
still come_true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you baby all night
When your heart was all fixed up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you
If I could wrangle all my sins
Take 'em back and make amends
And do it all over again
I'd take the wrongs
and make 'em right
All the lonesome lonely nights
Pack 'em up and haul
'em all back home to you
And I'd drive a thousand
miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies
could still come_true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you baby all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And all the lonely nights
in between
And give 'em back to you
Give it all back to you
Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber_on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday_night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush
soon_as you walk in a room
I can't get_enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I like a sunrise duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush
soon_as you walk in a room
I can't get_enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
Girl I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush
soon_as you walk in a room
I can't get_enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you
Sleeping has never been so easy
Though I'll still toss and twitch my feet
You occupy every one of my dreams
Makes closing my eyes
easier than it seems
And if it seems you don’t feel the same
That’s alright with me
I understand with me
isn't quite the best place to be
But your smile reminds me
of a place
that I can’t put my finger on, so
Just say the word and I’m gone
I linger on all the things
that you’ve said to me
Always wanna be your flower
I wanna make you feel real easy
I wanna hear you talk for hours
And baby love, if it’s bad
If it’s not what you’d hoped for
You can always take it back
I’d give you what I can afford
‘Cause everything you do I adore
So maybe you could let me
hold your hand real tight
And tell you
why the sea reminds me of you
And then sleeping
has never been so easy
Though I wish that you
could be near
It_feels like I’ve fallen
for you completely
Maybe it’s best
that you can’t be here
When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived
with Snow White
I wonder_if she ever thought
The storybook tiles
on the roof were too_much
But from the window,
it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's
Dianetics or stucco
The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason
I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide
in plain sight
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
And here, everyone knows
you're the way to my heart
Hear so_many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some,
looking your worst
But never not sweet
to the trust funds and punishers
Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
It's for the best
I can't open my mouth
and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop
I dreamed I had a good job and I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade
A hundred dollars on a Kewpie doll
No pretty chick is going to make me crawl
Get on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman, child and man
Gets a Cadillac and a great_big diamond ring
Don't you know you're_riding with the king
He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
He's going to check us all on out of here
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your prescription filled
Get on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody, everybody clap your hands
And don't you doubt, love, the way that he sings
Don't you know you're_riding with the king
Riding with the king
Don't you know you're_riding with the king
A tuxedo and a shiny 335
You can see it in his face, the blues never lie
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
And don't you know we're_riding with the king
I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten_years old
With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm going to play this thing until the day I die
Don't you know we're_riding with the king
Don't you know we're_riding with the king
Riding, you're_riding with the king
You're riding, you're_riding with the king
Have_yourself
a merry_little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on my troubles
will be out of sight
Have_yourself
a merry_little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on my troubles
will be miles_away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends
who are dear to us
They gather near
to us once more
Through the years
we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star
upon the highest bow
And have yourself
a merry_little Christmas
Have_yourself
a merry_little Christmas
Have_yourself
a merry_little Christmas now
I was alone
In the boarded up streets
The closed signs swung like a poem
Here where the street sweepers sleep
It_was a hot summer
I was feeling cool
There was no_one there knowin'
I was lookin' for you
Well the bars were all empty
And the pavements were cracked
And the river ran wild
So I was fast on its track
It_was a hot summer
I sang out of tune
There was no_one there knowin'
I was just a fool
I've got burgundy blood
A tiger stone in my boot
Hip flask in my pocket
We could dance on the roof
It_was a hot summer
And I'm just a fool
There was no_one there knowing
I was looking_for you
On the other_side
On the other_side of the wild and true sages
On the other_side
On the other_side of you
It_was a hot summer
I was just a fool
I knew it right then
But there was nothing to do
Under the ground
There's a neighborhood that can't be seen
And up in the trees, there are voices that are echoing
And up in the trees, there are voices that are echoing
A_million different languages
Songs we sing
It's in our nature
To look out for each_other
In the heart of the woods
When there is danger
We'll take care of each_other
In the heart of the woods
It's in our nature
To look out for each_other
In the heart of the woods
When there is danger
We'll take care of each_other
In the heart of the woods
Heart of the woods
We spent all day where the north_wind blows
And you bought me a lavender rose
Put it in water when we got home
That's what heaven is
No tears to cry, and nothing to mourn
Wearing your shirt so tattered and torn
Lying in your arms, so safe and warm
That's what heaven is
I don't_care for money or fame
All for you, I'd give it all away
The way you sound when you call my name
That's what heaven is
Nobody knows where we go when we die
Maybe we'll ride white horses in the sky
And if we don't then, darling, tonight
That's what heaven is
If all I have is the light in your eyes
That's what heaven is
Be_yourself when you're holding on
Be_yourself one day
Be_yourself when you're holding on
Be_yourself one day
Take on the colors on
And fire fight the winter storms
Be yourself, don't hide your name
If you call it about, don't be afraid
Be_yourself when you're holding on
Be_yourself one day
Won't_cry, won't_cry, won't cry
Won't_cry, won't_cry, won't cry
Won't_cry, won't_cry, won't cry
Won't_cry, won't_cry, won't cry
Take on the colors on
And fire fight the winter storms
Be yourself, don't hide your name
If you call it about, don't be afraid
Won't_cry, won't_cry, won't cry
Won't_cry, won't_cry, won't cry
Won't_cry, won't_cry, won't cry
I wanna bathe in the moonlight
Until I'm fully charged
Come into my power
And heal the broken parts
That I carry
Hmm-mm
Like the bracelet that you bought me
I want you on my arm
Calm, cool, and protective
And keeping me from harm
Jade green
Jade green
I always keep it on me
Always keep it on me
I can't_help it
I get anxious
And every_time we part
I say a little prayer
To drive away the dark
And I'm with you
And you're with me
Like the bracelet that you gave me
Jade green
Jade green
I always keep it on me
Always keep it on me
On me
On me
Hmm, on me
I got a girl crush, hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long_blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me just as much
I got a girl crush, I got a girl crush
I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get her off my mind
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long_blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me just as much
I got a girl crush
I got a girl crush, hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush, it ain’t slowin’ down
I am sitting In the morning
At the diner On the corner
I am waiting At the counter
For the man To pour the coffee
And he fills it Only halfway
And beforeI even argue
He is looking Out the window
At somebody Coming in
It is always Nice to see you
Says the man Behind the counter
To the woman Who has come in
She is shaking Her umbrella
And I look The other way
As they are kissing Their hellos
I'm pretending Not to see them
Instead I pour the milk
I open Up the paper
There's a story Of an actor
Who had died While
he was drinking
It_was no_one I had heard of
And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking For the funnies
When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so I raise my head
There's a woman On the outside
Looking inside Does she see me
No she_does not Really see me
Cause she_sees
Her own reflection
And I'm trying Not to notice
That she's hitching Up her skirt
And while she's Straightening
her stockings
Her hair Is getting_wet
Oh this rain It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening
To the bells Of the cathedral
I am thinking Of your voice
I must be invisible
No one knows me
I have crawled
down dead end streets
On my hands and knees
I was_born with a ragin thirst
A hunger to be free
But I've learned
through the years
Don't encourage me
Cause I'm a lonely stranger here
Well beyond my day
And I don't know what's goin on
I'll be on my way
Yes_I'II
I'll be on my way
Yes_I'II
Yes_I'II
I'll be on my way
When I walk stay behind
Don't get close to me
Cause it's sure to end in tears
So just let me be
Some will say that I'm no good
Maybe I agree
Take a look then walk_away
That's all right with me
Cause I'm a lonely stranger here
Well beyond my day
And I don't know what's goin on
I'll be on my way
Yes_I'II
I'll be on my way
Yes_I'II
I'll be on my way
Yes_I'II
I'll be on my way
Yes_I'II
I'll be on my way
Yes_I'II
I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
Lately I've_been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you
Lately I've_been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I'd have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way
I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems_like by now
I'd find a love who cares just for me
Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come_true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems_like by now
I'd find a love who cares just for me
Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come_true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
When love comes over you
All of our dreams would come_true
When love comes over me and you
All of our dreams would come_true
When love comes over me and you
All of our dreams would come_true
When love comes over you

You can dance
Every dance with the girl who gives you the eye
Let her hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the girl who'd like to treat you right
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Dance and sing
But while we're apart don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh,_darlin', save the last dance for me
You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If she_asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You must tell her no
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh,_darlin', save the last dance for me
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh,_darlin', save the last dance for me
All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, ev'ry note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams area apart
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you cam along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shinin' soft in your eyes
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
I feel the trembling tingle of a sleepless_night
Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright
Beams of blue come flickering through my window_pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame
And I wonder_if you know
That I never_understood
That_although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would
Moonlight used_to bathe the contours of your_face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
And the fragrance of your flowers rest beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead
And I wonder_if you know
That I never_understood
That_although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would
Never_thought the words you said were true
Never_thought you said just what you meant
Never_knew how_much I needed you
Never_thought you'd leave, until you went
Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs
And I wonder_if you know
That I never_understood
That_although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would
I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice
that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow
where the wild bees swarm
And I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
making memories of us
I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention
like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world
better_than it's ever been
And I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
making memories of us
We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll_be a new day
Comin' your way
I'm gonna be here for you
from now on
This you know somehow
You've_been stretched to the limits
but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to
meet you with a warm, wet kiss
And I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
making memories of us
I'm gonna love you
like nobody loves you
And I'll win your trust
making memories of us
The snow in Montana was three feet high
The lady at the counter said there_ain't no flights
And so he called her on the telephone
He_said, 'I'll rent a car, and I'll drive home'
And she said, 'I'll wait for you
Like I did last year
At Christmas time with your family here
And your truck broke_down out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you'
Now he's on his cell phone in a Coupe De ville
Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
Her heart is achin' 'cause she_wants him home
She says, 'I'll wait for you like in '68
When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
Remember, dear, our son's first cry
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you'
He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said, she's in a better place
She_said to give this you this note just in case
And it said, 'I'll wait for you at Heaven's gate
Oh, I don't_care how long it takes
And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best_friend
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
P.S. I love you, too
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you'
A winter's dat in a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an_island
I've built walls,
A fortress deep and mighty
that none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship cause pain.
It's laughter ad it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock
I am an_island
Don't talk of love
Well. I've heard the words before.
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't distrub the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an_island
I have my books and my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor, hinding in my room, safe within mt womb
I touch no_one touches me.
I am a rock
I am an_island
And a rock feels no pain
Abd an_island never cries
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
I can't handle all this pain
All we ever do is fight anyway
Why we even tried I haven't a clue
With hearts involved
There's way too_much to lose
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
You were something else to look_at
Your intentions they weren't all bad
Tried to make me something I wasn't
Lord knows there_ain't no future
In all that
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
Hey, did you happen to see
The most_beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey, if you happen to see
The most_beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell_her I'm sorry
Tell_her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?
I woke_up this mornin'
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong, and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away_from me
So, hey, did you happen to see
The most_beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey, if you happen to see
The most_beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell_her I'm sorry
Tell_her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?
If you happen to see the most_beautiful girl
That walked out on me
Tell_her I'm sorry
Tell_her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?
Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
I find myself disposed
Brightness fills empty_space
I search of inspiration
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my eskimo_friend
I look to my eskimo_friend
I look to my eskimo_friend
When I'm down,_down, down..
Rain it wets muddy roads
I find my self esposed
Tapping doors, but irritate
In search of destination
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my eskimo_friend
I look to my eskimo_friend
I look to my eskimo_friend
When I'm down~~~
When I'm down,_down, down.
When I'm down,_down, down.
Life_is just a bowl of cherries
삶은 체리가 담긴 그릇에 지나지 않아
Sometimes it's afraid filled_with worries
가끔은 근심으로 가득차 두려울 때도 있지만
Don't be afraid, When things go wrong just be strong
걱정하지 마, 일이 잘 안될 땐 그저 강해지면 돼
When thing seems up in the air
일이 허공에 걸린 것 처럼 느껴질 때나
and Everything is so unfair
모든게 불공평한 것 같을 때
And you stumble and fall
실수해서 넘어져버릴 것 같을 땐
Just pick yourself up and sing
기운내고 일어나서 노래하는거야
If one day you lose your way
언젠가 네가 길을 잃고
Just remember one thing, my friend
헤매게 된다면 한 가지만 기억해
When you're under a cloud
풀이 죽고 울적할 땐
Just visit music and sing
음악에 몸을 맡기고 노래해봐
If one day you lose your way
언젠가 네가 길을 잃고
Just remember that I'm here to stay
헤매게 된다면 내가 여기 있다는 걸 기억해
Don't you give up, keep your chin up
포기하지 마, 낙담하지 마
And Be Happy
그리고 행복해지자

> This, no song of ing?©nue,
This, no ballad of innocence;
This, the rhyme of a lady who
Followed ever the natural bents.
This, a solo of sapience,
This, a chantey of sophistry,
This, the sum of experiments, --
I loved them until they loved me.
Decked in garments of sable hue,
Daubed with ashes of myriad Lents,
Wearing shower bouquets of rue,
Walk I ever in penitence.
Oft I roam, as my heart repents,
Through God's acre of memory,
Marking stones, in my reverence,
"I loved them until they loved me."
Pictures pass me in long review,--
Marching columns of dead events.
I was tender, and, often, true;
Ever a prey to coincidence.
Always knew I the consequence;
Always saw what the end would be.
We're as Nature has made us -- hence
I loved them until they loved me.
Princes, never I'd give offense,
Won't you think of me tenderly?
Here's my strength and my weakness, gents -
I loved them until they loved me.
At last the secret is out
As it always must come in the end
The delicious story is ripe to tell
To the intimate friend
Over the tea-cups and in the square
The tongue has its desire
Still waters run deep, my dear
There's never smoke without fire
Behind the corpse in the reservoir
Behind the ghost on the links
Behind the lady who dances
And the man who madly drinks
Under the look of fatigue
The attack of migraine and the sigh
There_is always another story
There_is more_than meets the eye
For the clear voice suddenly singing
High up on the convent wall
The scent of the elder bushes
The sporting prints in the hall
The croquet matches in summer
The handshake, the cough
The kiss, the kiss, the kiss
There_is always a wicked secret
A private reason for this
At last the secret is out
At last the secret is out
At last the secret is out
I don't know
if I can do this
alone
Oh after all our
sweet love is flown
I've_been a running
I've_been skipping like a stone
And I don't know if I
I can do this
all alone
When I met her
she was standing by a door
I ain't never
seen a light like that before
Now she's left me
for something more sure
And I don't know if I
I can do this
anymore
'Cause lovers will come
lovers will go
This rare seed are
from which true love might grow
If you see her won't
you please
say_hello
'Cause I don't know
I can do this
alone
I see a_couple strollin'
down the street
They're so in love
There_is not a worry
And to the clock they said goodbye
They ain't in a hurry
And sometimes I feel kind_of lonely
Ask myself where is my one and only
Until she comes to me I'll wait
Until then I shouldn't be
feeling this way
Won't let no Valentine's get me down
Or when Christmas time comes around
Just cuz I'm alone right_now
Don't mean I should hold a frown
Oh in the meantime
love is here you'll_find
The simple things
that slip your mind
The joy of hope for better days
You know that love
can find its ways
When you finally find the one
who you can call your own
You can tell yourself
the wait was worth it all
Cuz you got something
here to last forever
I can smile cuz there's so_much
in store The future holds for me
more_than I will ever know
Shouldn't make no room
for feeling sad
Won't let no Valentine's get me down
Or when Christmas time comes around
Just cuz I'm alone right_now
Don't mean I should hold a frown
Oh in the meantime
love is here you'll_find
The simple things
that slip your mind
The joy of hope for better days
You know that love can find its ways
Won't let no Valentine's get me down
Or when Christmas time comes around
Just cuz I'm alone right_now
Don't mean I should hold a frown
Oh in the meantime
love is here you'll_find
The simple things
that slip your mind
The joy of hope for better days
You know that love can find its ways
I'm so_glad you
made time to see me
How's life
Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've_been good busier than ever
Small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time you saw me
Still burns in the back
of your mind
You gave me roses
and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front_of you
saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
It turns out freedom ain't
nothin' but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had
when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These_days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back
myself leaving
When your birthday passed
And I didn't call
And i think_about summer all the
beautiful times
I watched you laughin'
from the passenger side
And realized I loved you
in the fall
And then the cold came
With the dark days
when the fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front_of you
saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
all the time
It turns out freedom ain't
nothin' but missing you
Wishing I'd realized
what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December
turn it around and change
my own mind
I'd go back to December
all the time
I miss your tan skin
your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms
That September night
The first_time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again
I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it
but I can't
So if the chain is on your door
I understand
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front_of you
saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom
ain't nothin' but missing you
Wishing I'd realized
what I had when you were mine
turn it around and
all the time
I'd go back to December
turn it around and change
my own mind
I'd go back to December
All the time
All the time
Undeserving favours mine
we gather while they stray
And we would browse
their terrace house
while they went away
You would play their records
and i would eat their light rye
Sooner than wait the shelves
were straight then
we had arrived
They said to take their birds
inside only over night
We would feed them
all the seed and
thought they would survive
But they were buried
by the apple tree
In a grave as wide as my hands
So we were scared to see
Them when they arrived
Them when they arrived
Them when they arrived
Undeserving favours mine
we gather while they stray
And we would browse
their terrace house
while they went away
But when you're over prying
plans and into other fires
Please do tell them all was well
when we had arrived
then we had arrived
then we had arrived
"Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
I better stop now before I start crying
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
I don't want to see the day when it's dying
She's a sight to see, she's good to me
I'm already somebody's_baby
She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
But I'm already somebody's_baby
You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll_find it's the only
Little part_of your life you're keeping together
I'm nice to you, I could make it through
That you're already somebody's_baby
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me baby
Because your candle burns too bright
Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
Even_if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired_of being down, I got no fight
You're wonderful, when it's beautiful
But I'm already somebody's_baby
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too
Well, I'm already somebody's_baby
Already somebody's_baby

Please_stay by my side
Now I’m in town break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night
In front_of a new crowd
That’s you now ciao
Seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can’t no I won’t hush
I say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See I’m true my songs are where my heart is
I’m like glue I stick to other artists
I’m not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
And move to greener pastures
See I’m real I do it all it’s all me
I’m not fake don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put
Give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cos You need me man_i dont_need you
You need me man_i dont_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you at all
You need me man_i don`t_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you at all
You need me
I sing I write my own tune and
I write my own verse hell
Don`t need another wordsmith
to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer
You’re just bluffing
Your name’s on the credits
And you didn’t write nothing
I sing fast
I know that all my shit’s cool
I will blast
And I didn’t go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I can’t last if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live feels_like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
‘A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi’
Cos You need me man_i dont_need you
You need me man_i dont_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you at all
You need me man_i don`t_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you
You need me man_i don`t_need you at all
You need me
And all i want in this cold world
Is to make music
And use it not to abuse it
And get infected Defected
With the who`s who of music
Who did it Who is it Who`s in it
Who what the hell_does it matter
Chitter Chatter don`t matter
What a Yidda Yidda Yatta
It don`t matter to me
All i want is a bit of dignity
You need to battle this industry
Freely to be me in this CD needy world can you hear me
Hey
So i keep singing that
When i first started this rapping shit
I felt Pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadist
And just developed a hater rador
Im made for the stars Pay my grind in the dark
And they came with the remedy kicking rhymes
With the melody hennesy shots
And all these fools on the block
Who said you`ve gotta be a Gangster now
to raise to the top
Im just a normal casual usual
everyday type of guy with my head in the sky
Ed sheeran urban angel comming ready to die
So see the signs stand at the side open your eyes
And take a look and realise
The ressurection arised and theres a missed clears
I arised from my tomb in the sky
I`m all alone a lone star urban angel
Raising from the ashes suprising no haters
Guiding or moving steady now
You can find me in the club Bottle full_of bub
Look mami i got the X if you into taking Drugs
Im into having Sex i ain`t into making love
So come give me a hug if your into getting rough

And dragging your mother's clothes
Cinder and smoke
The snake in the basement
Found the juniper shade
The farmhouse is burning down
Give me your hand
And take what you will tonight
I'll give it as_fast
And high as the flame will rise
Cinder and smoke
Some whispers around the trees
The juniper bends
As if you were listening
Give me your hand
Your mother is drunk
As all the firemen shake
A photo from father's arms
Cinder and smoke
You asked me to pray for rain
With ash in your mouth
You'll ask it to burn again
There's a guy at the door
wearing black eyeliner
There's a birthday girl goin'
for an all nighter
And the frat boys knockin' back
shots with the bikers
Just another night with a
buncha outsiders yeah
All the neon signs
lighting up our faces
Grab another round

The kick drum kicks in loud

Sunflower sweet mornin'
For every_time I'm gonna make you mine
You could be my favourite taste
To touch my tongue
I know someone who could serve me love
But it wouldn't fill me up
You could have my favourite face
And favourite name
I know someone who could play the part
But it wouldn't be the same
No it wouldn't be the same
No it wouldn't be the same
No it wouldn't be the same
As with you
You could be my favourite place
I've ever been
I got lost in your willingness
To dream within the dream
You could be my favourite faded fantasy
I've hung my happiness upon what it all could be
And what it all could be
What it_all, what it all could be
What it_all, what it all could be
With you
What it_all, what it all could be
What it_all, what it all could be
What it_all, what it all could be
With you
You could hold the secrets that save
Me from myself
I could love you more_than love could
All the way from hell
You could be my poison, my cross
My razor blade
I could love you more_than life
If I wasn't so afraid
Of what it all could be
What it_all, what it all could be
Of what it_all, what it all could be
With you
What it_all, what it all could be
Of what it_all, what it all could be
What it_all, what it all could be
With you
Loved is all that bloomed
Always what you did
Never let someone go or they
I ain't never loved like you
I've never loved I've never loved
I've never loved loved loved like you
I've never loved
I've never loved
I've never loved
We've wanted to be trusty and true
But feathers fell from our wings
And we've wanted to be worthy of you
But weather rained on our dreams
And we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So fellas, lay down your fears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here
'Cause we never wanted to be lusty or lewd
Nor tethered to prudish strings
And we never wanted to be jealously tuned
Nor withered into ugly things
But we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So fellas, lay down your spears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here
And if all that you are
Is not all you desire
Then, come
Come, let yourself be wrong
Come, it's already begun
Come, come alone
Come with fear, come with love
Come_however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with friends, come with foes
Come_however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with me, then let go
Come_however you are
Just come, come alone
Come so carefully closed
Come_however you are
Just come
Come, come along
Come with sorrows and songs
Come_however you are
Just come, come along
Come, let yourself be wrong
Come_however you are
Just come
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your_face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll_never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out_loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your_face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll_never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
The smile on your_face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll_never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
Did I say that I loathe you
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
My mind my mind
'Til I find_somebody new
Baby last_night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no_doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes
and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark
under September stars
in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever
tell you enough
That all I need in this life is
your crazy love
If I never get to see
the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see
the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand
in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah
Baby and that red_dress
brings me to my knees
Oh but that black_dress
makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint you're a God
it's the cutest the hottest
a masterpiece
It's too good to be true
nothing better_than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know
that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is
your crazy love
If I never get to see
the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see
the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand
in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah
I don't need no vacation
no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home
listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace
And if I never get to build
my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car
up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand
in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could girl
I could die
I could die a happy man
Some says your dreams
are a distant road
Down which our hearts
would like to go
But I have always stayed in place
Under that old illusion that is safe
You said the ship in
port is the safer one
But it's not the reason
it was made
So forgive me if I wander off
And forgive me more if I just stay
Sing another song
for the lost ones
We're the ones
who need it the most
Every_time you run it'll cost ya'
But it doesn't stop us runnin'
If a coward dies
a thousand times
Then there's a graveyard
in my head
'Cause it took me
years to say the words
That you denied even need said
Sing another song
for the lost ones
We're the ones
who need it the most
Nothin' that you fear is forgotten
It follows you around like
Then everything danced
to a stranger tune
And we found our song
and we found our truth
And now that
we know it's that we always knew
Farewell to the chains
we were born into
And as we danced among
the ashes of our arms
We laughed it off
And then we burned our
tiny world to find the ocean
Just beyond those paper walls
I've cussed on a Sunday
I've cheated and I've lied
I've fallen down
from grace a few too_many times
But I find my holy redemption
when I put this car in drive
roll the windows down
and turn up the dial
Can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels_like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every_single verse
Yeah I guess_that's my church
When Hank brings the sermon
and Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold cold heart burning
hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world
gets heavy
and I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling
the radio scrolling
until my sins wash_away
Can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels_like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every_single verse
Yeah I guess_that's my church
Can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels_like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every_single verse
Yeah I guess_that's my church
Hey can I get a hallelujah
can I get an amen
Feels_like a holy ghost
running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I'll find my soul revival
singing every_single verse
Yeah I guess_that's my church
Yeah I guess_that's my church
Yeah I guess_that's my church
If you want candy on your arm
If you wanna pretty lucky charm
If you wanna trophy on your shelf
You better find_somebody else
If you want a
girl that don't speak her mind
All smiles all yes all of the time
I ain't made for these four walls
Let 'em fall down
I don't want no fences around me
Nobody boxing me in
Can't saddle me up
Cause I'm the kind_of
Girl that needs the wind
Ridin' with the fire in my eyes
Flyin' straight
through the open wide
Cause baby I'm a wild_horse
wild_horse
Don't try to tame me
Baby I'm a wild_horse wild_horse
Ain't gonna break me
If you wanna love me understand
You gotta be down with the way I am
All my flaws and all my quirks
All my glitter all my dirt
I gotta think_about feeling free
This restless heart it
just won't breathe
And these four walls
they're too small
So let_'em fall
I don't want no fences around me
Nobody boxing me in
Can't saddle me up
'Cause I'm the kind_of
Girl that needs the wind
Ridin' with the fire in my eyes
Flyin' straight
through the open wide
Cause baby I'm a wild_horse
wild_horse
Don't try to tame me
Baby I'm a wild_horse wild_horse
Ain't gonna break me
Baby I'm a wild_horse
You can't tame a wild_horse
You can't change a wild_horse
Nothing like a wild_horse
I don't want no fences around me
Nobody boxing me in
Can't saddle me up
'Cause I'm the kind_of
Girl that needs the wind
Ridin' with the fire in my eyes
Flyin' straight
through the open wide
Cause baby I'm a wild_horse
wild_horse
Don't try to tame me
Baby I'm a wild_horse wild_horse
Ain't gonna break me
Ain't gonna change me
No no
If you want candy on your arm
If you want a pretty lucky charm
If you wanna trophy on your shelf
You better find_somebody else
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While journeying through
This world of woe
Yeah, and there's_no sickness
toil nor danger
In that bright land
To which i go.
[Chorus]
I'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going_over jordan
I'm only go
Going_over home.
[Verse_2]
I know dark_clouds
Will gather on me
I know my way
My way is rough and steep
Yeah, and beautiful fields
Lie just before me
And God's redeemed
Their vigils keep.
[Chorus]
I'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going_over jordan
I'm only go
Going_over home.
I'm going there to see my Mother
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going_over jordan
I'm only go
Going_over home.
[Verse_3]
I want to wear
That crown of glory
When I get home
To that good land
Well, I want to shout
Salvation's story
In concert with
All the blood-washed band.
[Chorus]
I'm going there to see my Saviour
I'm going there
No more to roam
I'm only go
Going_over jordan
I'm only go
Going_over home
Well, I'm only go
Going_over home
Yeah, only
She_said
Love me just a little_bit more
Hold me just a little_bit longer
Say my name the way you used_to
She gives her love to me
unconditionally
How could I ever refuse ya
And if the year that
I was_born is like the morning
And the year that
I die is like the night
Then this time between
is such a short and precious thing
I can't_wait till
after the evening's done
just to love you
Days and nights with her
We grow just a little_bit stronger
I tried in vain one time to trace it
Time was we ran away
From the truth and
the words of the music
But there's still time for us to face it
She_said
Love me just a little_bit more
Hold me just a little_bit longer
Say my name the way you used_to
She gives her love to me
unconditionally
How could I ever refuse ya
And if the year that
I was_born is like the morning
Then the year that
I die is like the night
Then this time between
is such a short and precious thing
I can't_wait till after the evening's
done just to love you
And know I need you still
You know I always will
And know I need you still
You know I always will
And know I need you still
You know I always will
Take one last look in that rear_view on your way
Outta that stick_around town you're about to leave behind
And go get lost to find yourself
Don't be afraid to go and have yourself the craziest of times
Make some new friends
Be someone you've never been
But every now and then
Chorus
Call your_mama
Sit and listen to her small_town drama
And get you all caught_up on all your sisters and your brothers
Boy, listen to your mother
'Cause you ain't ever gonna get another
Someone you get to call your mama, yeah
Verse_2
One of these_days on down the road
You're gonna find
You a strong willed girl with a gentle heart like hers
And don't forget to call her dad 'fore you buy that ring
And if they both say_yes then first things first
Chorus
Call your_mama
Sit and listen to her small_town drama
And get you all caught_up on all your sisters and your brothers
Boy, listen to your mother
'Cause you ain't ever gonna get another
Someone you get to call your_mama
Bridge
And do it while you can
Even when you don't wanna
'Cause there's gonna come a day the good Lord's gonna
Call your_mama
Mmm, he's gonna call your_mama
Chorus
Yeah, pick_up the phone boy, you better call your_mama
Sit and listen to her small_town drama
Get you all caught_up on all your sisters and your brothers
Oh, tell her that you love her
'Cause you ain't ever gonna get another
So call your_mama
Mmm, you better call your_mama
I'm sorry
But I'm just a girl not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keeping it together
I hold my composure for worse_or for better
So I apologize
If you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is
You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk_away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty
Oh no, you can't dress it up in lace or rhinestones
Don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain
So let it flow like a river
You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk_away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty
Oh, no, you can't
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty yeah_yeah yeah_yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah_yeah yeah_yeah yeah
No no no
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby, oh yeah
No, you can't cry pretty
In the world that you would make up
With unicorns and buffalo packs
I know that you would wake_up
With the sunny side
touching your back
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
Coming up with theories on him
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
He's riding in the devil's abyss
Oh I would rate the future
If I could put a finger on it
But I have no idea
If what I want is better_than this
Is it the lonely man of winter
I could put my finger on that
Is it the lonely drive to Denver
The loneliness
of Hoppington's hat
Is it the time we spent in silence
The silence of a winter he had
Is it the lonely man of winter
I could put my finger on that
And even if it's Christmas
Could we just pretend for a bit
That everything we went through
Was someone_else's carpenter kiss
In the world
that you would make up
With unicorns and buffalo backs
I know that you would wake_up
With the sunny side
touching your back
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
Coming up with theories on him
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
He's riding in the devil's abyss
Oh I would write the future
If I could put a finger on it
But I have no idea
If what I want is better_than this
Is it the lonely man of Christmas
He's hoping for a break
in the plan
Is it the lonely drive to Denver
The loneliness
of holding your hand
Is it the time we spent in silence
The silence of a wintery head
Is it the lonely man of winter
I could put my finger on that
And even if it's Christmas
Could we just pretend for a bit
That everything we went through
Was something
so_much better_than this
Mother left you in the night
My_father faded into the same light
Now we're both hoping
to find someone
I hope you hear this song
And you leave your old boyfriend
Come back where you belong
In my arms
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
All of the days and the nights
You and I and a dream in Ojai
Filling up both of our_lives
With love
Sometimes you're like the wind
Like my mother sang in 1987
Now your life's sure to begin
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll chose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love
Now you're gone again
I gave all that I had to give
But I lost my friend
Just before the holiday
Unable to learn my own name
Or blow the wind away
What would you say
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
Kaitlin
All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll chose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love
I Know It Hurts
Don’t Wanna Get Out Of Bed
Much Rather Lay There Instead
Instead You Face What You Fear
The Thought That No One Is Near
It Hurts
You’re Living
But Don’t Feel Alive
No Motivation Or Drive
As You Search For Answers To Why
Oh Why
Why me
Won’t Somebody Please
Take My Burdens Away
I Can’t Do This Today
You’ve Got To Hold On
Hold Onto What You Believe In
Weather Through Every Season
Take It One_Day At A Time
You’ve Got To Hold On
Don’t Put Aside
What You’re Feeling
There Is A Process Of Healing
You Will_Be More Than Alright
Take It One_Day At A Time
So Overwhelming
Everyone’s Counting On You
Unaware You Need Help Too
But You Don’t Say A Word
Too Much Work To Be Done
No Fun
Go Through The Motions Eyes Closed
‘Cause You’re Always
Doing The Most
But The More That You Do
The More You Seem To Lose
Why me
Won’t Somebody Please
Take My Burdens Away
I Can’t Do This Today
You’ve Got To Hold On
Hold Onto What You Believe In
Weather Through Every Season
Take It One_Day At A Time
You’ve Got To Hold On
Don’t Put Aside
What You’re Feeling
There Is A Process Of Healing
You Will_Be More Than Alright
Take It One_Day At A
Time After Time
I Have Tried Hard To Fight
Against All My Desires
I Would Swallow My Pride
But I Know I Am Called
To Live Free And Fulfilled
No It Will Not Be Easy
But I Will_Be Still
I Will_Be Still
I Will_Be Still And Know
You’ve Got To Hold On
Don’t Put Aside
What You’re Feeling
There Is A Process Of Healing
You Will_Be More Than Alright
Take It One_Day At A Time
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt_like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now
Verse_1
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these_days
Pre-Chorus 1
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh,_oh, oh
Chorus 1
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
Verse_2
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used_to be a little_kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me
Pre-Chorus 2
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing_else I could do
And I forget_about you long_enough
To forget why I needed to
Chorus 2
'Cause there we are again in the middle_of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was_there, I remember it all too_well, yeah
Bridge
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too_much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being_honest
I'm a crumpled up piece_of paper lying_here
'Cause I remember it_all, all, all
Too well
Verse 3
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very_first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid_of it
'Cause you remember it all too_well, yeah
Chorus 3
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It_was rare, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
Outro
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It_was rare, I was_there, I remember it all too_well
If you wanna take me
Go ahead and try my head
Experience is nothing compared to
The sleep paralysis in my bed
If you wanna love me
Try to get inside my_brain
Experience is nothing compared to
The nights I'm always up so late
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis 'til I die
Die
'Cause if you want
you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to only if you want to
If you want you could go
ahead and fix my head
If you want to only if you want to
If you wanted to
If you try to
Wishing I still had my dreams
Late night started take up space
'Cause every_time I try to remember
Lack of sleep takes half my_brain
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis 'til I die
Die
'Cause if you want
you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to only if you want to
If you want you could go
ahead and fix my head
If you want to only if you want to
Use some pesticides
and throw it in my_brain
If you want to only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up
at night and I'm going insane
If they try to only if they try to
If you wanted to
If you try to
'Cause if you want
you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to only if you want to
If you want you could go
ahead and fix my head
If you want to only if you want to
Use some pesticides
and throw it in my_brain
If you want to only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up
at night and I'm going insane
If they try to only if they try to
When you left I met a girl
who turns the world upside_down
Counting satellites
we let the twilight swim
inside our eyes
I can almost reach the clouds
but I can't lift
my feet off the ground
I should be over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
Why don't I feel like I'm
Holding the stars
when she's lying in my arms
I should be over the moon
But I still ain't over you
You took me high
you held my hand
taught me to dance on the skyline
Like wild stallions
we're_riding free
she's showing me new horizons
I can almost see the sun
but I can't lift my feet and run
I should be over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
Why don't I feel like I'm
Holding the stars
when she's lying in my arms
I should be over the moon
But I still ain't over you
I thought her kiss would carry me
Across the deep ocean blue
But loving her ain't
like loving you
You send me over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
You make me feel like I'm
Holding the stars
when you're lying in my arms
I should be over the moon
Spinning in the sky
Floating to Mars
I wanna feel like I'm
Holding the stars
I want you back in my arms
I should be over the moon
I still ain't over you
I still ain't over you
You got a new tattoo
And you bought a nice pair_of shoes
To remind you who you used_to be
When life was something brand_new
‘Cause now you sleep a little lighter at night
And you wake_up when the sky gets light
And crawl into the kitchen at dawn
And tell yourself it’s alright
You swore you didn’t want strings attached
And to be tethered to the telephone
But now there’s no_one here to talk to
And you prefer to sleep alone
All the chances that you couldn’t take
Mistakes that you couldn’t afford to make
Well what would it have cost you?
When you had a new tattoo
And you were only 22
You had a hole in your shirt
But there was nothing that you couldn’t do
Now you’re standing in the vestibule
Wondering how they got the best of you
Now that you do your own laundry
Now that there’s always something pressing you
You swore you didn’t want strings attached
And to be tethered to the telephone
But now there’s no_one here to talk to
And you prefer to sleep alone
All them chances that you couldn’t take
Mistakes that you couldn’t afford to make
Oh and what would it have cost you?
Well your dad is gonna cover away
And mom is gonna’ say it’s okay
When you call them every Monday at 9
And tell them that it’s going fine
All your friends, they just exhaust you
You could’ve left, but where would you go off to?
Oh, and what would it have cost you?
So you got a new tattoo
To make you feel something new
The sign of a cross on your thigh
And you don’t even really know why
But you’re hoping that it marks the end
Of a time that you could just forget
So you call it a draw for the night
And you tell yourself it’s alright
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth
Yeah birds need bees
and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need
girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the Dark
needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights
need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin'
hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin'
knockin' boots
Knockin' boots me and you oh
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs
some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need
I want you so_bad
Yeah birds need bees
and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls
like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the Dark
needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need
both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin'
hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin'
knockin' boots
Knockin' boots girl me and you
Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'
And birds need bees
and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need
the girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the Dark
needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights
need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin'
hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin'
knockin' boots
Mmm knockin' boots
me and you oh
Knockin' boots
I stop and listen sometimes
Clock myself into your eyes
And I can see what you see
and I like it
I'm a fish in a blue sea
and I like it
But don't pick on me
with your sympathy
I don't I don't need you
to love me
Listen to the people who say
Lalalala_lalalala
Lalalala_lalalala
This snow is falling heavy
Wish my mother would
come and get me
Forget all this makeup
and fall in the red sea
Set the weight of each day
like the leaves of our oak_tree
But don't pick on me
with your sympathy
I don't I don't need you
to love me
Listen to the people who say
Lalalala_lalalala
Lalalala_lalalala
Everybody's moving away
Lalalala_lalalala
Water pushes water away
Lalalala_lalalala
It's all good 'cause I feel it too
Hanging around with nothing to do
Make friends with the angel
that blessed you
Maybe together we get in the good
Lalalala_lalalala
Lalalala_lalalala
Lalalala_lalalala
Lalalala lalala
It's a small thing
I guess that I like a lot
Power to live_without pain or thought
Big house on the hill where I lay my head
[Refrain]
Bum bum, ba da dum, da_da da_da dum
Bum bum, ba da dum, da_da da_da dum
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse_2]
Honestly, floating, it's all good to me
I feel quite innocuously, being peacefully
I like the water
I like the sea
I like the way it used_to be
[Refrain]
Bum bum, ba da dum, da_da da_da dum
Bum bum, ba da dum, da_da da_da dum
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Outro]
Come
So come
Like a fish
He said I see my mama
she looks about 23
She's running my way
with the angels
Right next to Jesus
Yeah his eyes lit up
staring_at the living_room ceiling
And with his last few breaths
he said I wish you could see it
Don't you cry for me
'cause I'm in God's glory
And I can see his face
it's amazing
I know you have doubts
but I see it right_now
I promise it's real keep praying
I'll be waiting take your time
And go write a story
That you can't_wait to tell me
On the other_side
Oh_oh on the other_side oh_oh
I said someday

Better find a way
to be up in the rafters
When I have you a grandbaby
I got somebody
good to name 'em after
There's gonna be a lot of sadness
On a lot of happy days
I'll try to think of this_moment
This place and hear you say
Don't you cry for me
'cause I'm in God's glory
And I can see his face
it's amazing
I know you have doubts
but I see it right_now
I promise it's real keep praying
I'll be waiting take your time
And go write a story
That you can't_wait to tell me
On the other_side
On the other_side
All my pain I get to leave it
It's time for me to get my healing
So don't you cry for me
'cause I'm in God's glory
And I can see his face
it's amazing
I know you have doubts
but I see it right_now
I promise it's real keep praying
I'll be waiting take your time
And go write a story
That you can't_wait to tell me
On the other_side
Oh_oh on the other_side
Take me home take me home
To the place I belong
'Cause I miss ya
and I wish ya would take me home
take me home
Said my goodbyes and hit the road
A head full_of dreams
in a suitcase of clothes
But I never made it made it far
'Cause I realized
I needed to be where you are
Been a lot of places
seen a lot of faces
now I know
That I've_been away for a minute
that I've_been away for too long
Take me home take me home
To the place I belong
'Cause I miss ya
And I wish ya would take me home
take me home
Ahh_ahh ahh_oh oh_oh oh_oh
Ahh_ahh ahh_oh oh_oh oh_oh
Lights in my rearview almost gone
Thought I could make it
Man was I wrong
Out on my own
I could only get so far
Then I realized
I needed to be where you are
Been a lot of places
seen a lot of faces
now I know
That I've_been away for a minute
that I've_been away for too long
Take me home Take me home

And take me home
I like my Fridays all alone
With no reason to check my phone
My friends are out and I think nothing of it
Content with myself on my own
[Pre-Chorus]
When I look in your eyes
Every day, every night
I think_about you all the time
Yeah, you got me like who am I? (Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
If touchin' you's gonna make me easy
That's okay 'cause I don't want space
If not sayin' enough's gonna make you leave me
I swear to God that I'll talk all day
You never needed anybody, but now you need me
I was the same, but things have changed
I'm needy
I'm needy
[Verse_2]
Want every moment that you're free
And then I miss you when you leave
I bet your_mama probably thinks I'm selfish
Look_at what you've_done to me
[Pre-Chorus]
When I look in your eyes
Every day, every night
I think_about you all the time
Yeah, you got me like who am I? (Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
If touchin' you's gonna make me easy
That's okay 'cause I don't want space
If not sayin' enough's gonna make you leave me
I swear to God that I'll talk all day
You never needed anybody, but now you need me
I was the same, but things have changed
I'm needy
[Bridge]
I know how it sounds, but I don't, I don't_care, no
I know how it sounds, but I don't, I don't_care, no
I know how it sounds, but I don't, I don't_care, no
I know how it sounds
[Chorus]
If touchin' you's gonna make me easy (I don't, I don't_care, no)
That's okay 'cause I don't want space (I don't, I don't_care, no)
If not sayin' enough's gonna make you leave me (I don't, I don't_care, no)
I swear to God that I'll talk all day
You never needed anybody, but now you need me
I was the same, but things have changed
I'm needy
[Outro]
Oh, mmm
A 40 HP Johnson
on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns
barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn
and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window
and one hand on the wheel
Some_things just go better
together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this
ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings
Or pourin' your heart into a song
that you ain't gonna sing
It's a match made up in heaven
like good ol' boys and beer
And me as long
as you're right_here
Your license in my wallet
when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every
coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say I love you too
is like rain on an_old tin roof
And your hand fits right into
mine like a needle in a groove
Some_things just go better
together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol'
guitar if it ain't got no strings
Or pourin' your heart into a song
that you ain't gonna sing
It's a match made up in heaven
like good ol' boys and beer
And me as long_as you're right_here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any_other way
And if I'm being_honest
Your first and my last name
Would just sound better together
and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar
if it ain't got no strings
Or pourin' your heart into a song
that you ain't gonna sing
It's a match made up in heaven
like good ol' boys and beer
And me as long_as
you're right_here
And me as long_as
you're right_here
Dark
Here inside my heart
Distance from the stars
Feels_like we're_going nowhere
Far
Miles from my heart
The space between the stars
Feels_like we're worlds apart
And even_though you had to go away
I'm still with you
And even if I couldn't make you stay
I still feel you here
Feel you here
Maybe these_words
will never reach you
Maybe that's alright
We'll just keep hoping things
will get better in time
Maybe these_words won't mean a thing
And maybe you're_doing fine
Wish it was you instead of my guitar
Holding you inside my arms
Try
To act_like I'm just fine
But really deep_inside
Feels_like I'm just getting by
And even_though you had to go away
I'm still with you
And even if I couldn't make you stay
I still feel you here
Feel you here
Maybe these_words
will never reach you
Maybe that's alright
We'll just keep hoping things
will get better in time
Maybe these_words won't mean a thing
And maybe you're_doing fine
Wish it was you instead of my guitar
Holding you inside my arms
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Wish it was you instead of my guitar
Holding you inside my arms
Thirteen staring in the mirror
You still look so innocent
but that was all gone yesterday
At eighteen
you'll see it a little clearer
As something that was taken
before you could give it away
You'll feel dirty
you'll feel guilty for
what was done to you
They'll be a canyon in your chest
for what you can't undo
It's gonna make you hate yourself
When you didn't hate yourself at all
It's gonna make you build a fortress
Where you never had a wall
It's gonna make you question God
And wonder_if he even cares
'Cause it's so messed_up
it's so wrong
It's just so unfair
And when you're broken
past the point
Of what a broken_heart can take
The cracks'll heal
but you'll always feel the break
And that's what's gonna make you
At twenty
it hits you like a racecar
It still feels_like a new scar
One that you dont talk_about
At twenty five
you'll_find the strength to say it
And even_though you can't change it
There's peace in saying it out_loud
You'll feel angry
you'll feel sad once
you see it's not your fault
And that canyon in your chest
is that little girl you lost
It's gonna make you hate yourself
When you didn't hate yourself at all
It's gonna make you build a fortress
Where you never had a wall
It's gonna make you question God
And wonder_if he even cares
'Cause it's so messed_up
it's so wrong
It's just so unfair
And when you're broken past the point
Of what a broken_heart can take
The cracks'll heal
but you'll always feel the break
And that's what's gonna make you
It's gonna make you love yourself
When you don't love yourself at all
'Cause if you can get through that
There's_no valley that's too tall
And all those questions you ask God
Are still gonna be there
'Cause it's so messed_up
it's so wrong
It's just so unfair
And it's amazing where a broken
heart can take you
All the things that bend
and stain and break you
That's what's gonna make you
But that's what's gonna make you
My buddy Brandon holds a record
For single season touchdown throws
And good old Johnny, he's the life of every party
It's like Cheers, they know him everywhere he goes
I've got some_famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Rutherford County our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big_city we're in
But when I go back home I've got some_famous friends
Yeah, I do
Mmhmm
My buddy Jason, he's the sheriff
He'll flash his lights but let me go
My boy Randy, he's a preacher
My girl Megan, she's been Teacher of the Year
I swear for five years in a row
I've got some_famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Hamilton County our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big_city we're in
But when I go back home I've got some_famous friends
Yeah, I do, ooh
I got friends in high places on these small-town roads
'Cause 'round here it's all about the people that you know
And I've got some_famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Davidson County our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big_city we're in
But when I go back home I've got some_famous friends
Yeah, I do, ooh
Yeah, I do
Might not know 'em here in this big_city we're in
But when I go back home I got some_famous friends, yeah
I've got some_famous friends (I've got some_famous friends)
Yeah
I wonder what
if I had gone to Californa
Seventeen with nothin' but a car
And a thing for seventies
and palm trees
Would I have made it by now
Would I be playin' to a crowd
That most of us only
play to in our dreams
I wonder what if I had
gone to New_York City
Paper walls on 41st in a five-floor
walk-up writin' like crazy
Would anybody know my name
Would I be on the edge of fame
Would I make it
Luck right into meant-to-be
What if I never second-guessed it
Took a chance and no_regrets
And chased a life a long
way from the rear_view
What if I traded every moment
Just to never look back on it
And wonder_if I'm missin' somethin'
But lookin' back I wonder
would I change my mind
What if I
What if I what if I what if I what if I
I wonder what
if I had been on a red eye
Chasin' down a sunset crowd
For a one-off show
somewhere down south
Would I have missed Mama's call
Sayin' Granddad took a fall
he ain't alright
Would I have missed
that goodbye
Or would he tell me
Girl you only get one life
What if I never second-guessed it
Took a chance and no_regrets
And chased a life a long way
from the rear_view
What if I traded every moment
Just to never look back on it
And wonder_if I'm missin' somethin'
But lookin' back I wonder
would I change my mind
What if I
What if I what if I what if I what if I
Ooh what if I
What if I what if I what if I what if I
What if I never second-guessed it
Took a chance and no_regrets
And chased a life a long way
from the rear_view
What if I traded every moment
Just to never look back on it
And wonder_if I'm missin' somethin'
If I'm missin' somethin'
But lookin' back
I wonder would I change my mind
Change my mind
And miss out on this life of mine
What if I
What if I what if I what if I what if I
Mmm what if I
What if I what if I what if I
Summer all over
Blame it on timing
Weakening August water
Loose-eyed in morning
Sunlight covered over
Wading in sight of fire
[Chorus 1]
And we're finally aligning
More_than maybe I can choose
[Verse_2]
Soon as I knew you
All so wide_open
Wading inside of fire
As if I just saw you
Cross Second Avenue
Wading in waist-high water
[Chorus 2]
And I love you so violent
More_than maybe I can do
[Outro]
Now we're finally aligning
More_than maybe I can choose
Hey I knew I'd run
into you somewhere
It's been a while
I didn't_mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy
But don't you
Don't you smile at me
and ask me how I've_been
Don't you say
you've missed me
if you don't want me again
You don't know
how_much I feel I love you still
So why don't you don't you
Ah_ah ah_ah
Sometimes I really wish
that I could hate you
I've tried
but that's just somethin'
I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this
But don't you
Don't you smile at me
and ask me how I've_been
Don't you say
you've missed me
if you don't want me again
You don't know
how_much I feel I love you still
So why don't you don't you
So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say
We're still friends
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again
Don't you Don't you
Don't you smile at me
and ask me how I've_been
Don't you Don't you
say you've missed me
if you don't want me again
You don't You don't
know how_much I feel
I love you still
So why don't you don't you
Ah_ah ah_ah
Don't you ah_ah ah
Visions
Trying to make sense of the now
Trying to make sense of the past
To show us how
Visions
Imagining the worlds that could be
Shaping a mosaic of fates
For all sentient beings
Visions
Cycles of growth and decay
Cascading chains of events
With no_one to praise or blame
Visions
Avoidable suffering and pain
We are patiently inching our way
Toward unreachable utopias
Visions
Enslaved by the forces of nature
Elevated by mindless replicators
Challenged to steer our
collective destiny
Visions
Look_at the magic of reality
While accepting with all honesty
That we can't know
for sure what's next
No we can't know
for sure what's next
But that we're in this together
We are here together
We are here together
We are here together
We are here together
We are here together
It_was a fun strange summer
I rolled on didn't think of you
We lost touch with each_other
Fall came and I had to move
Movin' backwards hurt comes after
Healin' doesn't happen
in a straight line
If I cry just a little and then
laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you
and then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time
to deal_with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more_than
just a little_justified
Mm mm
I'm more_than just a little_justified
To touch somebody
You know I tried to make that you
And when you lied
said you didn't want me
Tell me what was I supposed to do
Movin' onwards feelin' strong but
Healin' doesn't happen
in a straight line
If I cry just a little and then
laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you
and then I change my mind
If I need just a little
more time to deal_with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more_than
just a little_justified
Mm mm
I'm more_than just a little_justified
If I die just a little
inside just a little
If I want you and I call you
then I change my mind
If I need just a little
more time to deal_with the fact
That I shoulda treated you right
I'm more_than just a little
If I cry just a little and then
laugh in the middle
And I hate you and I love you
and then I change my mind
A_million times
If I need just a little
more time to deal_with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more_than
just a little_justified
Mm mm
I'm more_than just a little_justified
Oh lift up your head boy
Don't play pretend dead on the floor
Now Harryhausen
conceived from a cauldron
Wielding Olympus with eyes
on the shore
There's_nothing
There's_nothing
Oh show me the flow of my life
Bound by Acrisius
bronzed from the skylight
Seeking the oracle's eyes
in the night with a sigh
Seriphos greets us
with moments of silence
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
Who will arrange my great escape
Hopelessly I have been torn
from this outrage
Tossing and turning uneasy
it cost me the cross
Am I at rest or resigned in my chaos
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
There's_nothing
How_far away
There's_no place like home
There's something
And it's the light on your hand
There's something
And it's the touch of my wristband
There's one_thing
And it's the weight of our wish
There's one_thing
And it's our very_first kiss
The lamb cries 'til ears ring
I cannot love from my prison of shame
In Cimmerian Shade
I'll keep her safe in the well
tailor made
I just want you to love me
I just wanted to know myself
Fix it all_Jonathan Demme
Beauty resides where your spirit dwells
My Starling flies into the rainbow
Lost in the mist chrysalis kill your idols
Safe in my Autogynephilia
One black witch moth
now she's lost in the meadow
I just want you to love me
I just wanted to change myself
Fix it all_Jonathan Demme
Beauty resides
where your spirit dwells
I just want you to love me
I just want you to love me
I just wanted to change myself
Fix it all_Jonathan Demme
Fix it all_Jonathan Demme
Beauty resides
where your spirit dwells
Save me from everything I ask for
Soil from the sod lamb of god
rest in peace
I'm still just running from the answer
Safe in the cell
kiss and tell my Clarice
I just want you to love me
I just wanted to love myself
Fix it all_Jonathan Demme
Beauty resides
where your spirit dwells
I just want you to love me
I just want you to love me
I just wanted to love myself

I just wanted to love myself
I just want you to love me
I just want you to love me
I just wanted to love myself
I just want you to love me
I just wanted to love myself
Eyes of brown
Beautiful and she's so warm to just be around
My heart, it pounds
That she is more_than a pretty_face lost in the crowd
Won't you lie_next to me, oh_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh_Kayla?
Won't you lie, oh, next to me, oh_Kayla?
Okay
Rose like cheeks
You'll tell me I'm wrong and that's just because you don't like what you see
Just know I do and
All of the time, you're on my mind making me blind
Won't you lie_next to me, oh_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh_Kayla?
Won't you lie_next to me, oh_Kayla?
Won't you lie, oh, next to me, okay love
Okay
Okay love, okay
Siamese
You won't believe the breeze
Could belong to you
Overseas
The faded blues and greens
That were a part_of you
So should we appease
The land and the trees
The clouds and the stars?
The way that they are
Out of reach
Your favorite city dreams
In violent neon scenes
Fragrant leaves
That peace that summer sleep
We almost realized
That if we appeasе
The land and the trees
The clouds and thе stars
We'd stay where we are
All the places you'll go
You'll never be alone
Always be your home
Always be your home
She's like the lonely shade of blue
Counting down the hours
Till the bell rings after school
So she wrote that night
Don't fall in love with her
She said, don't fall in love
Don't fall in love
The timing of questions on his mind
Tore their world apart
Now the riddles keep him up
So he wrote that night
Don't fall in love with him
He_said, don't fall in love
Don't fall in love
I said, don't you want to disappear
Would you do it again
Oh, would you take me back
I said don't you, baby won't you, baby don't you
Would you live it again
She's like the mystery unsaid
Chasing every rose
With a daydream in her hand
Still holding on
Don't fall in love with her
She said, don't fall in love
Don't fall in love
I said, don't you want to disappear
Would you do it again
Oh, would you take me back
I said don't you, baby won't you, baby don't you
I said don't you, baby won't you, baby don't you
Would you live it again
I said don't you, don't you, don't you want to do it again
I said don't you, don't you, don't you want to do it again
Again
Don't you want to do it again Oh
I said don't you, don't you, don't you want to do it again
She's like the lonely shade of blue
Counting down the hours
Till the bell rings after school
So she wrote that night
Don't fall in love with her she said
Don't fall in love, don't fall in love
Lost of tears and omen
Season of the fall
I’m too quietly watching
The light, white, feathered-birds of yours
Trembling like the autumn leaves
And I will be in water till through
Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loneliest dream
For_whatever lives, is loneliear than the ocean
For_whatever breathe, is quieter than the seashore
Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loudest fear
For the sun is not near, drowned pale through the river
For_whatever is killed, is dying with the hours
For_whatever is filled, is drawing hole upon holes
Rain runs through the rafter
And I could hear you cry
I’m still quietly watching
The light, white, feathered birds of yours
Trembling like the southern wind
And I will be in water till through
Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loneliest dream
For_whatever lives, is loneliear than the ocean
For_whatever breathe, is quieter than the seashore
Bind me in your arms, bind me in your loudest fear
For the sun is not near, drowned pale through the river
For_whatever is killed, is dying with the hours
For_whatever is filled, is drawing hole upon holes
Verse_1
She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love
Chorus
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Verse_2
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt_road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out_loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she_calls home
Chorus
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Yeah, yeah, man
Bridge
Yeah
I ain't tryna fix her, I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul
No, we don't say forever, but when we're together
Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go,_yeah, she knows
Chorus
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Outro
Yeah
We tried to find our ways in life to give our hearts and soul a peace of mind
But you just wanna drink your wine, just grab that glas and let it go down
I can't hold you any longer
I can't_cope cause you're a storm
I wake_up feeling even smaller
Even when the storm is over
Was it all in my head
Did we try to hard and lost it all instead
Was it all a on me
Oh you back away so far I couldn't see
How_far you've drifted_away
Da_da da_daaa
Along the stream
Da_da da_daaa
How_far you've drifted_away
Da_da da_daaa
Away from me
I held you hand when time was ruff I tried to keep your feet on the ground
But you just wanna drink your beer and grab that glas and let it go down
Now I can't hold you any longer
I can't_cope cause you're a storm
I wake_up feeling even smaller
Even when the storm is over
Was it all in my head

Even when the storm is over
[Verse_1]
You feel misunderstood
Say what's the remedy
Would be like minded if we could
But that's not the case
(Ooh ooh)
The wind will turn
Don't be concerned (Ooh)
I can learn‌
[Chorus]
(Ooh)
When we end the siding games
And we don't pull them both ways
We can do it
We can do it
I know we'll find the missing frame
Sideways up or down it's all the same
We will do it
We will do it
[Verse_2]
Sweet rain and honest truth
Is what I get from you
No_matter how hard I get the blues
You keep me steady, yet loose
[Chorus]
(Ooh)
Whеn we end the siding gamеs
And we don't pull them both ways
We can do it
We can do it
I know we'll find the missing frame
Sideways up or down it's all the same
We will do it
We will do it
[Bridge]
(Nooo)
Don't don't, don't leave already
(Noo)
Oh no no, I'm not that steady ‌
(Noo)
Don't don't, don't go too_far now
(Oooh)
(Ooh ooh)
We can do it
We can do it
[Chorus]
(Ooh)
When we end the siding games
And we don't pull them both ways
We can do it
We can do it
I know we'll find the missing frame
Sideways up or down it's all the same
We will do it
We will do it
[Outro]
And we will do it
And we will do it
I met an_old man
I said, "Tell me your story"
He took out an_old pen
And wrote somethin' for me
Then he kept walking on down the road
And I watched him disappear like smoke
And I thought_I'd just seen a ghost
Then I looked down at what he'd wrote
It said,_"Son, when you grow_up, you'll be fine
I know, you've_got questions on your mind
Life_is gonna happen one way or the other
Whether you like it or not
Stop_looking for the answers, and you'll_find
What you've got"
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
I met a young man
Searchin' for glory
I took out an_old pen
And wrote him my story
Then I kept walking on down the road
When your time is up, it's time to go
I pray he reads what's on the note
And takes to heart what I wrote
I said,_"Son, when you grow_up, you'll be fine
I know, you've_got questions on your mind
Life_is gonna happen one way or the other

Life_is gonna happen one way or the other
Whether you like it or not
Stop_looking for the answers, and you'll_find
What you've got"
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
I met a young man
Searchin' for glory
I took out an_old pen
And wrote him my story
Then I kept walking on down the road
When your time is up, it's time to go
I pray he reads what's on the note
And takes to heart what I wrote
I said,_"Son, when you grow_up, you'll be fine
I know, you've_got questions on your mind
Life_is gonna happen one way or the other
Whether you like it or not
Stop_looking for the answers, and you'll_find
What you've got"
When you grow_up, you'll be fine
I know, you've_got questions on your mind
Life_is gonna happen one way or the other
Whether you like it or not
Stop_looking for the answers, and you'll_find
What you've_got
I love the way
You put on your dress
While the scent of the night
Still floats in the air
I love the time
We spend on the road
Looking_for answers
Answers to questions
We don't even know
But most of all
I love the way
We're floating in silence
Drifting in words
We don't need to say
You enter the room
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The bravest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
And I love the wallpaper
Of this cheap hotel
The fan's stuck like us
Running in circles
Lost in a spell
And I love the way
The haze can be broken
By the sudden rain
Leaving us drenched
Laughing and soaking
But most of all
I love the way
We're floating in silence
Drifting in words
We don't need to say
You enter the room
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The bravest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
You entered my life
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The sweetest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
They telephoned me just to say
That nobody had the time for yesterday
And all at once, I felt so small
Started feeling like nobody cared at all
But then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody_else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
(Mm-mm, mm-mm)
The people talk, it's background noise
I don't wanna hear nobody else's voice
There's something sweet about your scent
It's like lavender came and never left
And then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody_else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you
(Mm-mm)
Nothing ever seemed to go right
All my days, they just fell into nights
Until I got a little_bit of you in my life
And then, suddenly, everything's bright
I know that there's a million different ways I could say
How you're always the best part_of my day
And when you feel the need to forget the world
You can call anytime you want
Call anytime you want
(Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm)
I know you don't mean to be
mean to me
Cuz when you want to
you can make me feel
like we belong
We belong
Lately you make me
feel all I am
is a back up plan
I say I'm Done
and then you smile at me
and I forget
everything I said
I buy into those eyes
and into your lies
You say you'll call
but I know you
You say you're coming_home
but I know you
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
I wish you were
where you're supposed to be
close to me
But here I am just staring
at this candle
burning out
A stumbled sound
of foot steps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere
You say you'll call
but I know you
You say you're coming_home
but I know you
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
You say you'll call
but I know you
You say you're coming_home
but I know you
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
You say you'll call
but I know you won't
Well It's a marvelous night
for a Moondance
With the stars up
above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to
make romance
Neath the cover of
October skies
The look of love is in your eyes
The look your heart can't disguise
The look of love is saying so_much more
Than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well, it takes my breath away
I can_hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms_around you
How_long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Look of love is on your_face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start
Of so_many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss
I can_hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms_around you
How_long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
I can_hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms_around you
How_long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go, don't ever go
I love you so
I can't_wait forever is all that you said
Before you stood up
And you won't disappoint me
I can do that myself
But I'm glad that you've come
Now if you don't mind
Leave_leave
And free yourself at the same time
Leave_leave
I don't understand
you've already gone
And I hope you feel better
Now that it's out
What took you so long
And the truth has a habit
Of falling out of your mouth
But now that it's come
If you don't mind
Leave_leave
And please yourself at the same time
Leave_leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave_leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you came to now
Leave_leave
Leave_leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave_leave
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned
down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and
I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could
have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away
I've never been the kind
to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong
meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes Tonight I wanna cry
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
"All By Myself" would sure hit me
hard now that you're gone
Or_maybe unfold some old
yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets_better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way -
Promise me no promises,
So will I not promise you:
Keep we_both our liberties,
Never false and never true:
Let us hold the die uncast,
Free to come as free to go:
For I cannot know your past,
And of mine what can you know?
You, so warm, may once have been
Warmer towards another one:
I, so cold, may once have seen
Sunlight, once have felt the sun:
Who shall show us if it was
Thus indeed in time of old?
Fades the image from the glass,
And the fortune is not told.
If you promised, you might grieve
For lost liberty again:
If I promised, I believe
I should fret to break the chain.
Let us be the friends we were,
Nothing more but nothing less:
Many thrive on frugal fare
Who would perish of excess.
Hey_Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls
tossing rocks_at your window
I'll be the one
waiting there even when it's cold
Hey_Stephen
boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't_help it
if you look like an_angel
Can't_help it
if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've_been feeling_since I met you
Can't_help it if there's_no one_else
Mmm I can't_help myself
Hey_Stephen
I've_been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've_seen it all so I thought
But I never seen
nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk
way you say my name
It's beautiful wonderful
don't you ever change
Hey_Stephen
why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same
'Cause I can't_help it
if you look like an_angel
Can't_help it

Come feel this magic
I've_been feeling_since I met you
Can't_help it if there's_no one_else
Mmm I can't_help myself
They're dimming the street lights
you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now
so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine shine shine
Hey_Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
well they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you
I can't_help it if you look like an_angel
Can't_help it
if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I've_been feeling_since I met you
Can't_help it if there's_no one_else

Mmm I can't_help myself
Myself
Can't_help myself
I can't_help myself
All this time i was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've_been givin out
chances every_time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby
But i figured you out
And you think it would be fine again
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that
you're sorry
But i don't believe you baby
Like i did_before
You're not_sorry
Oh no no no
Looking so innocent
I might believe you
if i didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waitin
in the cold
And you got to share your secrets
And i'm tired_of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked
each time before
But you don't have to
call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can
tell me that you're sorry
But i don't believe you baby
Like i did_before
You're not_sorry
No no oh
You're not_sorry
No no oh
You had me crawling for you honey
And it never
would have gone away no
You used_to shine so bright
But watched our love fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't_pick up the phone
This_is the last_straw
There's_nothing left to beg for
And you can
tell me that you're sorry
But i don't believe you baby
Like i did_before
You're not_sorry
No no oh
You're not_sorry
No no oh
No no no no no no no no
No no no no
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are
jealous He says everything
I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful
tonight And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss_screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and
I'm_cursing your name
You're so in love that you act
insane And that's the way I
loved you Breakin' down
and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kinda_rush
And I never knew I could feel
that much And that's
the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he_calls exactly
when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss_screaming and
fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm_cursing your
name You're so in love
that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kinda_rush
And I never knew I could feel
that much And that's
the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's_not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling
anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated got away
by some mistake and now
I miss_screaming and fighting
and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm_cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming_undone
It's a roller_coaster kinda_rush
And I never knew I could
feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
And that's the way I loved you
Never_knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
Once_upon a time
I believe it was a tuesday
When i caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold_onto the night
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don`t feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened
Please_tell me cause one second it was perfect
Now you`re halfway out the door
And i stare, at the phone
He still, hasn`t called
And you feel so low you can`t feel, nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always
Oh, and it_rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It_rains when you`re here and it_rains when you`re gone
Cause i was there when you said
Forever and always
Was i out of line? did i say something way to honest?
Did you run and hide like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes, thought i knew you for a minute
Now i`m not so sure
One foot on the bus 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leaving this time
I thought about laying down in it's path
Thinking that you might get off for that
I remember that night we laid in bed
Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time
I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday When I Stop Loving You
I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end, it wasn't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right_now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
Somehow
I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
Oooh, oh someday
Oh, someday
I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
Someday when I stop loving you
All my bags are packed I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say_goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so_lonesome I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll_wait for me
Hold me like you'll_never let me go
Cause I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go
There's so_many times I've let you down
So_many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come_back, I'll bring your wedding_ring
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll_wait for me
Hold me like you'll_never let me go
Cause I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
Guitar Solo
Now the time has come to leave you
One_more time let me kiss you
Close your eyes I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll_wait for me
Hold me like you'll_never let me go
Cause I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go
Cause I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go
I guess you really did it
this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to
get it back
Wasn't it easier in your
lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful
when you believed_in everything
And everybody believed_in you
It's all right just wait and see
Your_string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
You're_still an_innocent
There's some things
you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live
it all again
You wouldn't be shattered
on the floor now
If only you would sing
what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your
firefly catchin' days
And everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down
to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin'
wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught_up
to you
It's all right
just wait and see
Your_string of lights is still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
It's okay life is a tough_crowd
32 and still_growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're_still an_innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed_up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never to late to
Be brand_new
It's all right
just wait and see
Your_string of lights are still
bright to me
Oh who you are is not
where you've_been
You're_still an_innocent
It's okay life is a tough_crowd
32 and still_growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're_still an_innocent
You're_still an_innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost never to like to
get it back
My mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red
like the sunset
Never keep it bottled up
Left to the hands of the foreigner
Be a true heart not a follower
We're not done yet
I see it in your movements tonight
If we can ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh I`ll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around
so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
You're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade_8
But I never felt this way
I'll_pick your feet up off
of the ground
And never ever let you down
Now you're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade_8
But I never felt this way
I'll_pick your feet up off
of the ground
And never ever let you down down
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow
For my weary head to
lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is
my new best_friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me
to the edge again
Now I see it in
your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around
so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
You're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade_8
But I never felt this way
I'll_pick your feet up off
of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade_8
But I never felt this way
I'll_pick your feet up off
of the ground
And never ever let you down
Hold my heart to stop me
bleeding now now now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me
bleeding now now now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me
bleeding now now now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me
bleeding now now now
And I'll never let you down
you're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade_8
But I never felt this way
I'll_pick your feet up off
of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming
on my heart strings
Like you were the grade_8
But I never felt this way
I'll_pick your feet up off
of the ground
And never ever let you down
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by
when it’s late
Sirens bleed
through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control
what I’m into
This tower is alive
the lights that blind
keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
sleep fills my mind
Can’t control what I'm into
London calls me a stranger
a traveller
This_is now my home my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
and puts me down
This_is not what I’m used_to
And the shop across
the road fulfils my needs
and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me
a stranger a traveller
This_is now
my home my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive
The traffic stops and starts
but I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This_is not my home home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
then that makes two
Traffic jam city streets forget_about the rest
Your sanity will be put to the test
Client call repeatedly they want another change
Some idiots just can’t make up their minds
Well I would if you want to go
Just sail_away from this madness
Where we will remain invisible
I wonder_if what future holds will never gonna come
We’re sitting here waiting like a fool
Photographs I stumbled on they scattered on the floor
They’re memories that haunt you from it’s grave
Well I would if you want to go
Just fly_away from this madness
Where we will remain invisible
Global warming’s the thing now everybody’s in
If you’re not green you better not be seen
Armageddon crystal ball Jesus reappears
They’re prophecies of world comes to an end
Well I would if you want to go
Just disappear from this madness
Yeah I would if you want to go
Where we will remain invisible
If you must wait
Wait for them here in my arms as I shake
If you must weep
Do it right_here in my bed as I sleep
If you must mourn my love
Mourn with the moon
and the stars up above
If you must mourn
Don't do it alone
If you must leave
Leave as though fire burns
under your feet
If you must speak
Speak every_word as though
it were unique
If you must die sweetheart
Die knowing your life
was my life's best part
And if you must die
Remember your life
You are
You are
Oh you are
You are
Oh
If you must fight
Fight with yourself
and your thoughts in the night
If you must work
Work to leave some
part_of you on this earth
If you must live darling one
Just live
Just live
Just live

walking in the haze
not a soul around just me

"Maybe one day I'll just let it all go
Let every shade of
my true colors show
Keep loving me and
I'll lose all control
Eventually
Never wanna be
never wanna be that girl
With a million needs
who keeps running your world
Boy do you lie
when you say I look good tonight
I see a mess in the mirror
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark_clouds rolling in
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody
coming out all wrong
But you hear a song you hear a song
They keep talking
All the ghost from the past
Heart broken
Can't_get over it fast
Just give it up stays around
And it never leaves
I see a mess in the mirror
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark_clouds rolling in
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody
coming out all wrong
But you hear a song you hear a song
A one note symphony Baby come on
And sing it back to me
I see a mess in the mirror
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark_clouds rolling in
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
It sounds like the chaos
I hear in my head
All night long but you hear a song
You hear a song
You hear a song
"
I can feel on my skin
all the hours we put in
Since my mind met your mind
I can see up ahead
there's the mountain where you'll say
you are mine you are mine
You feel the flames getting close to your_face
And i'm scared of the deepest night
These winter trees
they are dancing with dreams
in their branches for you and i
We'll_become We'll_become
The_greatest lovers The_greatest lovers
We'll_become We'll_become
The_greatest lovers
The_greatest love the world has ever seen
I can see a rushing river
running from here to forever
Hold on tight we'll float together
And we'll know we're alright
Oh and once the moon's arisen
We'll have light to climb the mountain
We'll be old and stronger within
I am_yours and you are mine
We'll_become We'll_become
The_greatest lovers The_greatest lovers
We'll_become We'll_become
The_greatest lovers
The_greatest love the world has ever seen
You feel the flames getting close to your_face
And i'm scared of the deepest night
These winter trees
they are dancing with dreams
in their branches for you and i
We'll_become We'll_become
The_greatest lovers The_greatest lovers
We'll_become We'll_become
The_greatest lovers
The_greatest love the world has ever seen
the world has ever seen
I wanna be drunk when I wake_up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make up, lip sticks to me
So now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat_here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used_to
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely_on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me
Should I, should I
Maybe I'll get drunk_again
I'll be drunk_again
I'll be drunk_again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll_never love me like you used_to
There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide_open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I, should I
Maybe I'll get drunk_again
I'll be drunk_again
I'll be drunk_again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk_again
I'll be drunk_again
I'll be drunk_again
To feel a little love
On a warm summer's eve
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us, he began to speak
He_said, "Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind me sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice"
So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his faced lost all expression
He_said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
Know_when to fold_'em
Know_when to walk_away
Know_when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep"
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
And in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
Know_when to fold_'em
Know_when to walk_away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
(When to hold 'em)
Know_when to fold_'em
(When to fold 'em)
Know_when to walk_away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
You've_got to know when to hold_'em
Know_when to fold_'em
Know_when to walk_away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin'_at the table
There'll_be time enough for_countin'
When the dealin's_done
'Ever since you left me
I've_been ridin' 'round
cranking up a little country
gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how_much more
missin' you I can take
I prayed prayed prayed
For a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time damn time
There's a neon_light at the end
of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright but
even_though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright
gonna make it a double
There's a neon_light at the end
of the tunnel_tunnel tunnel
I take a shot of I don't_care
what you're_doing now
Chase that one with
a cold screw you
When that's done I just might
wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone_new
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar bar bar
See if she_wants to try and
break my heart heart heart
There's a neon_light at the end
of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright but
even_though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright
gonna make it a double
There's a neon_light at the end
of the tunnel_tunnel tunnel
When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even_though I knew better_than
the pain would never end
They_say the night's darkest
just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break
got down on my knees
And I prayed prayed prayed
For a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time damn time
There's a neon_light at the end
of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright but
even_though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright
gonna make it a double
There's a neon_light at the end
of the tunnel_tunnel tunnel
I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act_like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that
she would get down with somebody I know
I guess_that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small_town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go around
But there's only so_many streets, so_many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've_known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small_town
For a while I guess they were keeping it low key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used_to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone_else's yard
In someone_else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that
she would get down with somebody I know
I guess_that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small_town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go around
But there's only so_many streets, so_many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've_known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small_town
Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, that guy but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that
she would get down with somebody I know
I guess_that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small_town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go around
But there's only so_many streets, so_many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've_known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small_town
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long_as you stand, stand_by me
And darling, darling, stand_by me
Oh stand_by me
Oh Stand
Stand_by me
If the sky we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Oh and the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't_cry, I won't_cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long_as you stand, stand_by me
Oh darling, darling, stand_by me
Oh stand_by me
Oh stand
Stand_by me
Whenever you're in trouble you just stand_by me
Oh stand_by me
Oh stand
Stand_by me
Stand_by me
Oh darling darling stand_by me
Oh stand_by me
Oh stand
Stand_by me
Stand_by me
Stand_by me
Stand_by me
I used_to know
What it felt_like to be loved
But now I don't know if I can ever feel
this way again because I
Thought that I had found the one
The one that I could wake_up
with knowing
That everything would be just fine
When the morning breaks
And the sunlight takes
the lonely nights away
That's when I'd come to realize
that we've just added oh
Just one_more day
To the history in the making
The feelings that you were faking
It's getting old I've_been told
I used_to know
What it meant to be yourself
But I was too blind
To see that you would rather
be with someone_else
But still I thought that
I had just one_more shot oh no
Too bad I didn't realize
I set myself up for one_more fall
When the morning breaks
And the sunlight takes
the lonely nights away
That's when I'd come to realize
that we've just added oh
Just one_more day
To the history in the making
The feelings that you were faking
It's getting old I've_been told
I used_to know
That when the music stops
The only beats will be
coming from our hearts
But how can that be
when you tore it apart
Like it was just a game
Oh no it'll never be the
same anymore I'm sure
So don't come running back to me
When you change your mind
just one_more time
Oh I decided I gots to draw the line
Somewhere somehow
that time it is now
Ain't_no stopping me
from moving on
Because it's time to stop
your playing girl
Cause now you're just a girl
I used_to know
I used_to know
I used_to know
I used_to know
I used_to know
Lately, it's been hard to breath
Just trying to keep my head above water
Sometimes life's in the way, all work and no play
And lately, it's been hard to see the way you used_to be
And I wonder, if the words I don't say
Can make it okay
But I've_been thinking bout us
And I know that the going is rough
And it feels_like a little too_much
Maybe I don't say it enough
So listen
Girl you know you're beautiful
I used_to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it
Still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
That I get to call you mine
So baby have I told you that I love you
Lately
Baby we can stay at home
Or ditch the phone
Don't have to go nowhere
And get lost in your eyes
Let the time fly by
Baby, it don't matter_what tomorrow brings
You know I'll be right there
Today and tonight, the rest_of my life
I've_been thinking bout us
And I know the going is rough
And it feels_like a little too_much
Maybe I don't say it enough
Girl you know you're beautiful
I used_to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it
Still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
That I get to call you mine
So baby have I told you that I love you
Lately
Oh yeah
Have I told you
Lately
Ooh mmm
Have I told that I love you
That you're funny that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you? Mmm
Have I told you?
Girl you know you're beautiful
I used_to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down, it
Still drives me crazy
You're beautiful
Gonna tell you all the time
Cause when you let your hair down, it
Still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
I can't believe that you're all mine
So baby have I told you you that I love you
Lately
Have I told you that I love you
That you're funny, that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Lately
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you?
Have I told you?
Lately
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away
from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
Never danced like this before
We don't talk_about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
We don't talk_about it
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We never danced like this before
We don't talk_about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
We don't talk_about it
We don't talk_about it
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
Never danced like this before
We don't talk_about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
We don't talk_about it
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We never danced like this before
We don't talk_about it
Dancing on
do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
We don't talk_about it
We don't talk_about it
We don't talk_about it
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
You try to get back
how it used_to be
Searching for truth
in the words I speak
But the message is blurred
and never quite complete
How you look in my eyes
I know you deserve more
Reflections in the water help
to clear my mind
Stretching out before me
to the other_side
We didn't even get a chance
to say_goodbye
Give me something to live for
something to die for
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
Is it something I'm not
not seeing
Is it not enough just just being
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
Ooh_ooh
Well I don't know what you need
when I'm so unprepared
Tell me what is a life
if it is not shared
I keep falling asleep pretending
that you're there
You gave me something to live for
something to die for
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
Is it something I'm not
not seeing
Is it not enough just
just being
Is it something that I'm
I'm missing
I'm missing
Oooh
Oooh
'Cause I feel it
Yes I feel it now
Yes I feel it
Yes I feel it now
You get what you deserve
leave it in the dirt
All of that work
and you're breaking it
breaking it
And it only gets worse
leave it in the dirt
All of that work
and you're breaking it
breaking me down
Why are you breaking me
breaking me down
Why are you breaking me
breaking me down
Is there something that I'm
I'm missing
Not matter_how hard I try
you're not listening
There must be something
that I'm I'm missing
I've_seen friends turn to
junkies with no purpose
out of money
Can I spend the night
I really need to crash
My shit is gone at a pawnshop
Fucking tweaker took my laptop
Burned a_bridge for
some dope and some cash
I'm trailer trash
drunk off my ass
And my savings went to liquor
so I'm all out of cash
I'm living fast I hate my past
And my shoes are old and ugly
but they still seem to last
My stomach always
seems to toss and turn
Drink so_much
my organs start to burn
I need some light
to write this song
But I forgot the pay the bill again
this night's gon' be long
Money can't fix a damn thing
I don't want to cry so I sing
I don't really
have no change to spare
Some_people do but life isn't fair
I'm trailer trash
drunk off my ass
And my savings went to liquor
so I'm all out of cash
I'm living fast I hate my past
And my shoes are old and ugly
but they still seem to last
Change is never
something that I want
I've_been here for years
this place will always haunt
My baby is gone
out of my life
I pretended I don't miss her
I don't know wrong from right
I'm trailer trash
drunk off my ass
And my savings went to liquor
so I'm all out of cash
I'm living fast I hate my past
And my shoes are old and ugly
but they still seem to last
I don't wash my clothes
at the laundromat
'Cause my best friend's got a washer
so I just fiend off that
I'm trailer trash
It made sense in the moment
No sense in a lone body
There's a lesson I know it
I confess that I ain't sorry
Same lens out of focus
Take the blame put it all on me
In a daze we've_been holding
To more or less a memory
And all at once
I feel it rising underneath
And all I want, is some time, define me
I'm a witness and you, showed me love
It_was only us and we were one
Was it all for nothing
Now I'm done done, done_done done
Done done_done done_done done
Done done, done_done done
Without a silent emotion
I've_been hiding away lonely
Get me out in the open
Somewhere in reality
I'll take a light where I'm going
I know I've_been out of reach
Think we already_know it
It's a lesson in love I need
And all at once
I feel it rising underneath
And all I want, is some time, define me
I'm a witness and you, showed me love
It_was only us and we were one
Was it all for nothing

Early April you walked up to me
Changing colors on city streets
Petals surrounding us in every shade of pink
We happened quickly, as humans do
Summer was coming, and change was too
Look_at me now, I'm fallin' at your feet
[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom,_baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom,_baby
I don't wanna blow away
[Verse_2]
When we're on_fire, it's something to see
No one can question the chemistry
Even in nature, timing is everything
[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom,_baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
Yeah, I'm your cherry blossom,_baby
I don't wanna blow away
Away, away
I'm your cherry blossom,_baby
Don't let mе blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your chеrry blossom,_baby
Don't wanna blow away
Away,_away, away
Away,_away, away
Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake_up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been_burning for so_many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads
[Chorus]
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change,_it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail_salon again
[Verse_2]
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been_burning for so_many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads
[Chorus]
'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen you'll grow out of
And all the times they will change,_it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon again
[Bridge]
Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means
[Chorus]
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change,_it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon
Maybe I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon again
I was_following the, I was_following the
I was_following the, I was_following the
I was_following the, I was_following the
I was_following the, I was_following the
Chorus
I was_following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertime
Chorus
I was_following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertime

I think I’ll be fine
What’s the worst thing they’ll say?
It can’t be that bad,
I’ve_been feeling okay
I’m not dying today
I remember when
They gave me the news
It’s been a few years
More_than just a few tears
But I still feel the blues
Do I spend more money
or put more sugar inside me?
Cauliflower rice costs extra
but not the spaghetti
Like there wasn’t already
enough to worry about,
It’s not like we can sit
here all day and pout
Try being a young person
with diabetes
betes_betes betes
betes_betes betes
betes_betes betes
I have to check my sugars
Every so often, and now I prick
My fingers bleed a little
And it really is a bit-tle
Onto a tiny gold strip?
And the number’s meant to tell me
If I’m doing well or not
Yet the doctors also tell me
Not to only trust the bot
Do I spend more money or
put more sugar inside me?
Cauliflower rice costs extra
but not the spaghetti
Like there wasn’t already
enough to worry about,
It’s not like we can sit here
all day and pout
Try being a young person
with diabetes
betes_betes betes
betes_betes betes
betes_betes betes
Now and then I tell myself
Can’t drink like I used_to
Now I’m a different me
Not who I used_to be
Gotta watch what I eat or do
Don’t answer those impulses
Say yes a lot less
Honestly it’s hard
But at_least my health’s not a mess
Do I spend more money or
put more sugar inside me?
Cauliflower rice costs extra
but not the spaghetti
Like there wasn’t already
enough to worry about,
It’s not like we can sit here
all day and pout
Try being a young person
with diabetes

If you need
Someone to call
I’ll be around
I know things
Haven’t gone your way
For a while
Move to the red bricks
To find a new version of yourself
Let it surface
Let it bloom
Miss your old friends
And all the shit you’d get up to
Ain’t it a shame
That what you love, you get used_to
If you need
Someone to call
I’ll be around
I know things
Haven’t gone your way
For a while
You moved to your mums house
To save up for a ring
But all you spent
Was time
On the wrong things
I hope your heart mends
How can you stand to go on like this
I hope your moonless sky
Finds light again
When you finally get off those meds
If you need
Someone to call
I’ll be around
I know things
Haven’t gone your way
For a while
But that’s okay.

Outro
Bury me in Georgia
Georgia
When you're on a crowded city street
Shouting people sirens never sleep
Take a look_at the limitless_outer space
When the blue_grows a darker and deeper_shade
And you'll surely hear the racket fade away
Everybody's on a shopping spree
Buying things that they don't really need
Take a look_at the limitless_outer space
When the blue_grows a darker and deeper_shade
And you'll simply feel the longing fade away
Lend an ear to the whisper behind machines
How it renders you wordless when stillness speaks
Take a look_at the limitless_outer space
When the blue_grows a darker and deeper_shade
And you'll clearly see the city fade away
When you're on a crowded city street
Shouting people, sirens never sleep
[Chorus]
Take a look_at the limitless_outer space
When the blue_grows a darker and deeper_shade
And you'll surely hear the racket fade away

Accidentally brushed his body
On the way to get a drink at the bar
I couldn't wait 'til later
Talking in the elevator
Then we're kissing in the back of the car

Kelsea Ballerini everyone
Give her a warm welcome
Give her a round of applause
Check, check
One, two, one, two, three
Hit it
Verse 1: Kelsea Ballerini
I bet you still live with your_mama
Down in her basement, tryin' to be Nirvana
Playin' with your guitar all afternoon Mm-mm-mm
You got the kinda face where it might've been a maybe
But you got a lot to learn 'bout flirtin' with a lady Mm-hmm
I'm down to talk dirty, but you started talking dirty too_soon
Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini, Kelly Clarkson & Carly Pearce
You're drunk, go home
If you're tryna hook up, gotta do it alone
The way you're slurrin' and the way you stumble
Ain't_no way you're gonna get my numbеr
Hey, walk_away
So me and my girls can do our thing
I ain't lookin' for a one-night rodеo
You're drunk Uh-oh, go home
Verse 2: Carly Pearce, Kelly Clarkson & Carly Pearce
I think they might've over served you George Dickel
Now your friends are all gone, got yourself in a pickle
This bar'll run dry 'fore I let you split a ride with me, baby
Yeah, I know you're a Virgo, that's the third time you told me
Just 'cause I am too doesn't mean that you know me
You're just a dog and barking up the wrong damn tree
Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini, Kelly Clarkson & Carly Pearce
You're drunk, go home Go home
If you're tryna hook up, gotta do it alone
The way you're slurring and the way you stumble
Ain't_no way you're gonna get my number
Hey, walk_away Walk away
So me and my girls can do our thing
I ain't looking_for a one-night rodeo
You're drunk Yep, go home Woo, alright
Bridge: Kelsea Ballerini
Play some country music, boys

Outro: Kelsea Ballerini, Kelly Clarkson & Carly Pearce

Hey, walk_away Walk away
So me and my girls can do our thing Can do our thing
I ain't looking_for a one-night rodeo I'm not, nope, woo
You ain't nothin' but a dive bar Romeo
You're drunk Mm-hmm, go home Ha, haha, hee-haw, haha
Sailing down behind the sun
Waiting_for my prince to come
Praying for the healing rain
To restore my soul again
Just a toerag on the run
How did I get here
What have I done
When will all my hopes arise
How will I know him
When I look in my father's_eyes
Look into my father's_eyes
My father's_eyes
When I look in my father's_eyes
Look into my father's_eyes
My father's_eyes
Then the light begins to shine
And I hear those ancient lullabies
And as I watch this seedling grow
Feel my heart start to overflow
Where do I find the words to say
How do I teach him
What do we play
Bit by bit, I've realized
That's when I need them
That's when I need my father's_eyes
Then the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears
I'm like a_bridge that was washed away
My foundations were made of clay
As my soul slides down to die
How could I lose him
What did I try
Bit by bit, I've realized
That he was here with me
I look into my father's_eyes
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time
[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled_up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over
[Verse_2]
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I wouldn't have to wonder_if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual, telling you you're beautiful
Oh, I'd be happily delusional
[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled_up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over
[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled_up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over
[Outro]
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And baby, me and you, we'd never fade, never fade
We'd never fade
Never fade, never fade
I still don’t let my close ones
close to me
And my hand still shakes
till it pours itself a drink
I still let these ghosts get the best
and the most of me
And the best I can do still
ain’t good enough for me
Wake me up
sit me down
Gimme a reason not to burn this town
Cuz them voices
in the dark yah been getting loud
Give me shelter_from the rain
Tell me I’m worth more_than my pain
thought I’d be somebody new
this time around
or at_least be better by now
better by now
better by now
I still draw my blood
when I don’t find the words to speak
I still ask for grace
from a god I don’t believe
I still hold my tongue
even tho it’s killing me
But I still tell myself
it’s the way it’s supposed
the way it’s supposed to be
So wake me up
sit me down
Gimme a reason not to burn this town
Cuz them voices
in the dark yah been getting loud
Give me shelter_from the rain
Tell me I’m worth more_than my pain
thought I’d be somebody new
this time around
or at_least be better by now
better by now
better by now
And these voices
And these choices
They both weigh me
Weigh me
Weigh me down
Wake me up
sit me down
Gimme a reason not to burn this town
Cuz them voices
in the dark yah been getting loud
Give me shelter_from the rain
Tell me I’m worth more_than my pain
thought I’d be somebody new
this time around
or at_least be better by now
better by now
better by now
Truly never thought there’d come day
Where there would be lights all flashing
All my worries seem to go away, oeh oeh
It’s the start the clock hit midnight
Surrounded by these strangers clashing,
But something ‘bout this night just feels right, oeh oeh
You, appeared out of nowhere came out of the
Blue, now am I stuck with you?
Baby
It’s 3AM we’re on the rooftop
Dancing like the time has just stopped
You grab my face and tell me baby
Life_is good,_life is good
We go and run all down the main street
You make me feel like it’s just you and me
We’re screaming at the top of our lungs,
Said life is good,_life is good
Having talks of where we’re going
Once we leave and get out of this town,
We’ll make it big one day and show them, oeh oeh
Lets own the world yeah just the two of us,
Our names, no, they won’t be forgotten
Tonight let’s act_like its our_last one, oeh oeh
You, appeared out of nowhere came out of the
Blue, now am I stuck with you?
Baby
It’s 3AM we’re on the rooftop
Dancing like the time has just stopped
You grab my face and tell me baby
Life_is good,_life is good
We go and run all down the main street
You make me feel like it’s just you and me
We’re screaming at the top of our lungs,
Said life is good,_life is good
You grab my face and tell me baby
Life_is good,_life is good
We’re screaming at the top of our lungs,
Life_is good,_life is good
You grab my face and tell me baby
Life_is good,_life is good
We’re screaming at the top of our lungs,
Life_is good
It’s 3AM we’re on the rooftop
Dancing like the time has just stopped
You grab my face and tell me baby
Life_is good
Maybe I'm lonely
Maybe it's true
Maybe I'm falling
For the feeling of falling for you
Why does it matter if the water is blue?
If you are the ocean
Then the river will lead me to you
Sometimes
I try too hard to pretend that I never cry
Sometimes
I shy away_from the flowers
and butterflies
Maybe you're lonely
Maybe it's true
Maybe you're falling
For the feeling of falling too
I know you're learning
All about love
From all of the books
That are broken and keeping you up
Oh-oh, oh,_oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Maybe I'm falling
For the feeling of falling for you
Oh-oh, oh,_oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I hope that you're falling
For the feeling of falling too
I am a poor Wayfaring stranger
나는 고통으로 가득찬 이 세상의 인생길을
While traveling through This world of woe
방황하고 있는 가련한 길손입니다

I know my way Is rough and steep
내가 가는 길은 험하고 가파를 것입니다
Yet beauteous fields lie Just before me
그렇지만 내 앞길에는
아름다운 동산이 예비되어 있습니다
Where God"s redeedmed Their vigils keep

항상 보호해 주실것입니다

I got the blues from my baby
left me by the San_Francisco Bay
The ocean liner's gone so far_away
Didn't mean to treat her so_bad
she was the best girl
I ever have had
She_said goodbye I can take a cry
I want to lay down and die
I ain't got a nickel
and I ain't got a lousy dime
She don't come_back
think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever gets back to stay
it's going to be another
brand_new day
Walking with my baby down
by the San_Francisco Bay
Sitting down looking
from my back door
Wondering which way to go
The woman I'm so crazy about
she don't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train
'cause I'm feeling blue
And ride all the way
to the end of the line
thinking only of you
Meanwhile in another city
Just about to go insane
Thought I heard my baby Lord
the way she used_to call my name
If I ever get her back to stay
it's going to be another
brand_new day
Walking with my baby down
by the San_Francisco Bay
Walking with my baby down
by the San_Francisco Bay
Walking with my baby down
by the San_Francisco Bay
One_day a friend took me a side
and said I have to leave you
For buying something from a friend
They_say I have done wrong
For protecting the name of a man
they say I'll have to leave you
So now I'm bidding you farewell
for much too long
And here's a song to sing
for every man inside
If he can hear you sing
it's an open door
There's not a rich man there
who couldn't pay his way
and buy the freedom
that's a high price for the poor
Kids in Texas smoking grass
ten year sentence comes to pass
Misdemeanor in Ann Arbor
ask the judges why
Another friend said to her kids
I'm gonna have to leave you
For selling something to the man
I guess I did wrong
And although I did the best I could
I'm gonna have to leave you
So now I'm kissing you farewell
for much too long
And here's a song to sing
for every man inside
If he can hear you sing
it's an open door
There's not a rich man there
who couldn't pay his way
and buy the freedom
that's a high price for the poor
Phillips
Twas a man of youthful features
Twas a boy of sorrowful eyes
Watching out but looking inward
Tall and stately and full_of life
In his life he spoke but rarely
In his mind he cried for light
Painting perceptions trying to capture
That which he saw in his questioning strife
Once in Lisbon, twice in London
Travelling around for all of his time
Looking_for and finding a goddess
He took Diana to be his wife
Of the children they'd begotten
Two had died without knowing life
And the third I know not whereof
But if she lives, she will yet be kind
Casey had a mark of simple value
He had a star between his eyes
In his hands he held an axe blade
The Greek symbol of thunder and fire
On a night when the heavens were crying
He went down and took his blade
Chopping wood to warm his hearthside
The lightning came and my brother die
Bring him no wine from faraway vineyards
Tell him no tales of the canyon's might
But wish him peace and eternal wisdom
For he has died and he died in light
A long long time ago
I can still remember
How that music
used_to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make
those people dance
And maybe they'd be
happy for a while
But february made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one_more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about
his widowed bride
But something
touched me deep_inside
The day the music_died
So bye_bye miss_american pie
Drove_my chevy to the levee
But the levee_was dry
And them good old boys
were_drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll_be the
day that I die
this'll_be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so
have you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me
how to dance real slow
Well I know
that you're in love with him
'cause I saw you
dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage
broncin' buck
With a pink_carnation
and a pickup_truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music_died
I started singin'
bye_bye miss_american pie
Drove_my chevy to the levee
But the levee_was dry
Them_good old boys were
drinkin'_whiskey and rye
And singin'_this'll be
the day that I die
this'll_be the day that I die
Now for ten_years
we've_been on our own
And moss grows fat
on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used_to be
When the jester sang
for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed
from james dean
And a voice that came
from you and me
Oh and while the king
was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while lennon
read a book of marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music_died
We were singing
bye_bye miss_american pie
Drove_my chevy to the levee
But the levee_was dry
Them_good old boys were
drinkin'_whiskey and rye
And singin'_this'll be
the day that I die
this'll_be the day that I die
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off
with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried
for a forward pass
With the jester
on the sidelines in a cast
Now the half time air
was sweet perfume
While the sergeants
played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh but we never got the chance
'cause the players
tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music_died
We started singing
bye_bye miss_american pie
Drove_my chevy to the levee
But the levee_was dry
Them_good old boys were
drinkin'_whiskey and rye
And singin'_this'll be the
day that I die
this'll_be the day that I die
Oh and there
we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on
jack be nimble jack be quick
Jack flash sat on a candlestick
Cause fire is the
devil's only friend
Oh and as I watched
him on the stage
My hands were clenched
in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high
into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music_died
He was singing
bye_bye miss_american pie
Drove_my chevy to the levee
But the levee_was dry
Them_good old boys were
drinkin'_whiskey and rye
And singin'_this'll be the
day that I die
this'll_be the day that I die
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her
for some happy news
But she just smiled
and turned away
I went down to the sacred story
Where I'd heard
the music years before
But the man there said
the music wouldn't play
in the streets
the children screamed
The lovers cried
and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church_bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The father son and the holy ghost
They caught the last
train for the coast
The day the music_died
And they were singing
bye_bye miss_american pie
Drove_my chevy to the levee
But the levee_was dry
And them good old boys were
drinkin'_whiskey and rye
Singin this'll_be the
day that I die
this'll_be the day that I die
They were singing
bye_bye miss_american pie
Drove_my chevy to the levee
But the levee_was dry
Them_good old boys were
drinkin'_whiskey and rye
Singin this'll_be the
day that I die
I was all right
for a while
I could smile
for a while
But when I saw you last_night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say_hello
And though you wished me well
You couldn't tell
that I'd been
Crying over you
Then you said so long
left me standing
All alone
alone and crying
Crying crying crying
it's hard to Understand
that the touch
Of your hand
can start me crying
I thought that
I was over you
But it's true so true
I love you even more
Than I did_before
but darling
What can I do for you
don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying over you
yes now you're gone
And from
this_moment on
I'll be crying
crying crying crying
Yeah crying crying
over you~

Bye_Bye Love
Bye_Bye Happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye_Bye Love
Bye_Bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye my love goodbye
Bye my love goodbye
There_goes my baby
With someone_new
She sure looks happy
I sure am blue
She was my baby till_he stepped in
Goodbye to romance
That might have been
(* Repeat)
I'm through with romance
I'm through with love
I'm through with
Counting that stars above
And here's the reason
That I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me

내 사랑아, 잘가요

내 사랑아 잘_가
행복아 너도 잘_가
외로움아 반갑구나
울음이 나올 것만 같아
사랑이여 잘_가
달콤한 손길과도 헤어져야 하는구나
죽고 싶은 생각이 들어
내 사랑이여 안녕
내 사랑이여 안녕
내 애인이 낯선 사람과
함께 가고 있어
확실히 그녀는 행복해 보여
나는 이렇게 우울한데
그 사람이 우리사이에 끼어들기 전까지는
그녀는 나의 연인이었는데
연애가 아니었을지도 모르지만
연애여 안녕
(* 반복)
나는 연애로 부터 해방되었어
사랑도 끝장이 나버렸어
하늘의 별을 세어 보는 일도
이제는 끝이야
내가 자유로와진 이유는
여기에 있지
그것은 내 사랑하는 연인과
헤어졌다는 것이야
(* 두번 반복)
Busted flat in Baton Rouge
headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded
as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
just before it rained
Took us all the way
to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out
of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowing sad
while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield
wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang up
every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for
nothing' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin'
but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord
when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was
good enough for me
Good enough for me
and Bobby McGee
From the coal mines of
Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared
the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord
through everything I've_done
Every night she kept me
from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas
Lord I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home
I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows
for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body
next to mine
Freedom's just another word for
nothing' left to lose
Nothin' left is all she left for
me
Feeling good was easy Lord
when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy that was good
enough for me
Good enough for me
and Bobby McGee
La da_da la_la na_na na
La da_da na_na
La_la la da Me
and Bobby McGee
La_la la_la la da_da da
La_la la da_da
La_la la da Me
and Bobby McGee
La_la la_la la na_na na
La_la la da_da
La da_da da Me

When you're weary
feeling small
when tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
oh when times get rough
And friend just can't be found
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down.
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down.
When you're down and out
when you're on the street
when evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
oh when darkness_comes
And pain is all around
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down.
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll lay me down.
Sail on silver girl,
sail on by
your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
oh if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll ease your mind.
Like a_bridge over_troubled water
I'll ease your mind.
'Twas in another lifetime
one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
the road was full_of mud
I came in from the wilderness
a creature void of form
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again
you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death
and men who are fighting to be warm
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoke between us
there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
where it's always safe and warm
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
I was burned out from exhaustion
buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
ravaged in the corn
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around
and she was standin'_there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
and took my crown of thorns
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
Now there's a wall between us
somethin' there's been lost
I took too_much for_granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
on an uneventful morn
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails
and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
he blows a futile horn
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
I've heard newborn babies
wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth
stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man
is it hopeless and forlorn
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village
they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
I got repaid with scorn
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country
but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
to when God and her were born
Come_in, she said
I'll give ya_shelter from the storm
We'll_meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll_meet again
Some sunny_day
Keep smilin' thru
Just like you
Always do
'Til the blue_skies drive
The dark_clouds
Far away
And will you please say_hello
to the folks that i know
Tell'em that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll_meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll_meet again
Some sunny_day
(spoken)
Yeah we'll meet again
I don't know where
Anf I don't know when
But I do know
That we'll meet again
Some sunny_day
(spoken)
So Honey
Keep on smilin' thru
Just like you always do
'Til the blue_skies
Drive the dark_clouds
Far away
And would you please say_hello
To all the folks that I know
And tell'em I won't be long
They'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song
(with choir)
We'll_meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll_meet again
Some sunny_day
Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind.
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore.
So I`ll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love.
Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn.
Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say.
And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'til there's_no more to hide.
So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love.
Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind.
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shore.
When we open_our eyes and dream
We open_our eyes
When we open_our eyes and dream
We open_our eyes
Under normal, we change the wind
Facing every direction
Planted in the future, we live two lives
All to reveal a secret we can't hide
When we open_our eyes and dream
We open_our eyes
When we open_our eyes and dream
We open_our eyes
We search the sky, planets chasing the stars
Pulling toward deep affection
Weights and numbers measure a wound that won't heal
All to reveal a secret we can't hide
When we open_our eyes and dream
We open_our eyes
When we open_our eyes and dream
We open_our eyes
Just a smile
Just a glance
The Prince of Darkness
he just walked past
There's been a lot of people
they've had a lot to say
But this time
I'm gonna tell it my way
There was a town
It_was a strange little town
they called the world
It_was a lonely
lonely little town
Till one day a stranger appeared
Their hearts rejoicied
and this sad little town was
happy again
But there were some that doubted
They disbelieved,so they mocked Him
And the stranged He went away
and the said little town that
was sad yesterday
It's a lot sadder today
I walked in a lot of places
I never should have been
But I know that the Messiah
He will come again
In times like these,
In times like those,
What will be will be,
And so it goes...
There's always been laughing, crying,
Birthing, dying.
Boys and girls with hearts a-taken,
Give and break.
Heal and grow and recreate.
And raise and nurture,
But there not from time to...
Times like these,
Times like those,
What will be will be,
And so it goes...
And there's always been stop and go,
And fast and slow,
And action, reaction,
Sticks and stones
And broken bones,
Those for peace and those for war,
God_bless these ones, not those ones, but these ones...
Man...
Times like these,
Times like those,
What will be will be,
And so it goes...
And it always goes
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on it goes...
Mmmmm....mmmmmm...
Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one Of the pleasures I've known
주여.. 제가 아는 행복한것들중에서
어느 하나라도 즐길만한 어떤 일을
제가 한 적이 있는지요..
Tell me Lord,
말해주세요.주여..
what did I ever do That was worth loving you
내가 당신을 사랑할 가치가 있는
어떤 일을 한 적이 있는지
Or the kindness you've shown
혹은 내게 보여준 친절에 보답을 했는지
Lord help me Jesus,
도와주세요 주여
I've_wasted it so Help me Jesus I know what I am
모든걸 낭비했어요.
내가 내 자신을 잘 알고 있으니 나를 도와주세요.
Now that I know that I've need you so Help me Jesus,
이제 당신이 간절히 필요한걸 알고 있으니
도와주세요.주여..
my soul's in your hand
내 영혼은 당신 손에 달려있답니다
Try me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay All I've taken from you
당신으로부터 받아온 모든 것들을
제가 갚을 수 있는 방법이 있다고
주님께서 생각하신다면 절 시험하세요.
Maybe Lord, I can show someone_else
What I've_been through myself On my way back to you
아마도 내가 다른 사람에게 내가 걸어왔던 길을 끝내고
당신에게 가고 있단걸 보여줄 수 있을것 같습니다
Lord help me Jesus,
도와주세요 주여
I've_wasted it so Help me Jesus I know what I am
모든걸 낭비했어요.
내가 내 자신을 잘 알고 있으니 나를 도와주세요.
Now that I know that I've need you so Help me Jesus,
이제 당신이 간절히 필요한걸 알고 있으니
도와주세요.주여..
my soul's in your hand
내 영혼은 당신 손에 달려있답니다
(Always, always, always)
[Verse_1]
I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always
Always
[Verse_2]
Days may_not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an_hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always
[Verse_2]
Days may_not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an_hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always
I woke_up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever_since you found yourself in someone_else's arms
I've_been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's_nothing left to say, but
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing_left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole_lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired_of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It_seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing_left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole_lot better
But you'll think of me
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishin' I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing_left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole_lot better
But you'll think of me
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we got nothing_left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole_lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah
And you're gonna think of me
Oh someday baby, someday
Mile marker 203, the gas gauge leanin' on the edge of "E",
An' I'll be dang'd if the rain ain't pourin' down.
There's somethin' smokin' underneath the hood,
It's a-bangin' and a-clangin' an' it can't be good,
An' it's another fifty miles to the nearest town.
Everythin' I own's in the back in a hefty bag;
I'm outta cigarettes an' I'm down to my last drag.
I'd sure hate to break down here,
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear_view mirror.
Out in the middle_of nowhere, knowin'.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
I'd sure hate to break down here.
Under fifty thousand_miles ago,
Before the bad blood an' busted radio,
He said I was all he had ever needed.
But love is blind an' little did I know,
You were just another dead end road,
Made with pretty lies an' broken dreams.
Baby, leavin' you is easier than bein' gone.
I don't know what I'll do if one_more thing goes wrong.
I'd sure hate to break down here,
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear_view mirror.
Out in the middle_of nowhere, knowin'.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
An' I'd sure hate to break down here.
Oh, no.
I'd sure hate to break down here,
With nothin' up ahead or in the rear_view mirror.
Out in the middle_of nowhere, knowin'.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
An' I'd sure hate to break down,
It's too_late to turn around.
I'd sure hate to break down here.
It_was just another story written on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll_be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home
Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better_than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun?
Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol?
Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son?
Did no_one see the writing on the wall?
I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20, but I still don't understand...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better_than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
It_was just another story printed on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score...
You look to me like misty roses
Too soft to touch
But too lovely to leave alone
If I could be like misty roses
I love you much
You're too lovely to leave alone
Flowers often cry
But too_late to find
That their beauty has been lost
With their peace of mind
You look to me like love forever
Too good to last
But too lovely not to try
If I believe in love forever
I'd forget the past
You're too lovely
Not to try
I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there
I held my spirit to the glass
To prove it possibler
I turned my being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the owner's_name
For doubt that I should know the sound
To ask the owner's_name
For doubt that I should know the sound
I judged my features, jelled my hair
I pushed my dimples by
And waited if they twinkled back
Conviction might of me
I turned my being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the owner's_name
For doubt that I should know the sound
To ask the owner's_name
For doubt that I should know the sound
I told myself take courage, friend
That was a former time
But we might learn to like the Heaven
As well as our old home
I turned my being round and round and round
Paused at every pound
To ask the owner's_name
For doubt that I should know the sound
To ask the owner's_name
For doubt that I should know the sound
I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there
Ay tu primo colorado, con barba camburada
Y lleno de ballena inclinandose al sol
Tu rayo de luz roja, besando nuestra boca
El beso que te sopla huele al col
Ay tus tres ojos lunares extraterrestriales
Entran cuando sales, por eso y no se ven
Ay tu barba colorada traviesa y rebelde
Me afeito con espada, pero devuelve!
Oh, la,_la, la,_la, la,_la, la
Si la noche te persigue entregate a ella
O dile que tienes dolor de cabeza
Sombrita de reflejo, dame algo tierno
Me como tu amor y cago el infierno
Ay, oh,_oh, oh,_oh, oh, ay, oh,_oh, oh,_oh, oh
Berno, oh,_oh, berne, berne, berne, oh,_oh
Ah, la,_la, la,_la, la,_la, la
Ay tus ojos colorados azul y anaranjados
Amarillo y verde y maron
Mi amor envuelto en tu corazon
No lo sueltes por favor
Somos elefantes y serpientes semejantes
Tomando agua ardiente en el sol
En el sol, en el sol, en el sol
La, la,_la, la,_la, la,_la, la,_la, la,_la
Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer,
And all the time I know,
Plant_your love and let it grow.
Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow,
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, let it grow.
Looking_for a reason to check out of my mind,
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on,
But there’s nothing_left to show,
Plant_your love and let it grow.
Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow,
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, let it grow.
This_is getting shorter and there’s much for you to do.
Only ask and you will get what you are needing,
The rest is up to you.
Plant_your love and let it grow.
Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow,
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, let it grow.
Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow,
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, let it grow.
I see your_face in my mind as
I drive away
Cause none_of us thought
it was gonna end that way
People are people
and sometimes we change our minds
But it's_killing me to see you go
after all this time
Music starts playin
like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't
really wanna see
Cause it's tragedy and
it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be
without you around
And we know it's never
simple never easy
Never a clean break
no_one here to save me
You're the only thing
I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe
Without you but I have to
Breathe
Without you but I have to
Never wanted this
never want to see you hurt
Every_little bump in the road
I tried to swerve
People are people and
sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna
save us from the fall out
And we know it's never
simple never easy
Never a clean break
no_one here to save me
You're the only thing
I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe
Without you but I have to
Breathe
Without you but I have to
It's two a m
feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy
easy for me
It's two a m
feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy
easy for me
And we know it's never
simple never easy
Never a clean break
no_one here to save me oh
I can't breathe
Without you but I have to
Breathe
Without you but I have to
Breathe
Without you but I have to

the bees have control of your mind
but i choose not to belive that
so well meet in the darkness
of the night
and i promise i will be there on time

oh my darling honey i have saved you
and now that your with me
we can make our own honey
oh buh duh pum buh dum pum
puh dah dah duh pah puh dum dum
Broken dreams broken dreams
Hoping someday you'll see me
Sky is grey sky is grey
But I'm dancing in the rain
Live to sway live to sway
When you remember my name
Live a lie live a lie
Well don't you ask yourself why
Don't you open your eyes
Only the moon only the moon
only the moon
Will hear my plea
Only the creatures of the night
Will harmonize with me
Miss you so miss you so
And I wondered if you know
The wind is_blowing
on the end of this corner
And it's hard to let go
That's story
That's the story of you and me
That's the story
That's the story of you and me
Come and lay here beside me
I`ll tell you how I feel
There`s a secret inside me
I`m ready to reveal
To have you close
embrace your heart
with my love
over and over
These_are things that I promise
my promise to you
For all of my life
you are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
all of my life you are the one
I`ll give to you my greatest love
for all of my life
Let me lay down beside you
There`s something you should know
I pray that you decide to
open your heart and let me show
enchanted worlds of fairy_tales
a wonderland of love
these are things that I promise
my promise to you
For all of my life
you are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
all of my life you are the one
I`ll give to you my greatest love
for all of my life
All of my life
all of my heart
these are things that I promise
For all of my life
you are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
for all of my life you are the one
I`ll give to you my greatest love
for all of my life
You are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
for all of my life you are the one
I`ll give to you my greatest love
for all of my life
This_is wrong
But I can't_help but feel like
There aint nothin' more right babe
Misty morning comes again
and I can't Help but wish
I could see your_face
And I knew from the first note
played I'd be breaking
all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So_dim that spotlight
Tell me things like I can't take
my eyes Off of you
I'm no_one special
Just another wide_eyed girl
Who's_desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall Superstar
Morning loneliness comes around
when I'm not Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your_face
I'd be Counting down
the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front
Row scream your name
So_dim that spotlight
Tell me things like I can't take
my eyes Off of you
I'm no_one special
Just another wide_eyed girl
Who's_desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall Superstar
You played in bars you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone
knows who you are And you'll_never
see you sing me to sleep
Every night on the radio
So_dim that spotlight
Tell me things like I can't take
my eyes Off of you
I'm no_one special
Just another wide_eyed girl
Who's_desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to
hang on my wall Superstar
Sweet sweet superstar superstar
I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too_late
I run my life
Or is it running me
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming_undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you
We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slippin' right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming_undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming_undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you
I run to you
I run to you
I always run to you
Gonna take a trip to Laredo
Gonna take a dip in the lake
Oh, I'm at a crossroads with myself
I don't got no_one else
And possibilities at the door
I won't be needing them anymore
Oh, is this the first_time in your life?
It's hard just to get by
But oh, my love, don't you even know?
And oh, my love, are you really gone?
Ooooh
And can you see the world through a window?
Are you having troubles in droves?
Oh, I think the worst thing I could do
Is get back home to you
I put a bullet in my Kia Lorenzo
A kitchen knife fucked in my face
Throw me in the deep of Jenner Lake
Believe me when I say
That oh, my love, you don't even call
And oh, my love, is that you on the phone?
Ooooh
...
And oh, my love, you don't even know
That oh, my love, are you really gone?
Ooooh

na_na na_na na_na na
We′re talking away
I don′t know what
I′m to say I′ll say it anyway
Today′s another day to find you
Shying away
I′ll be coming for your love, OK
Take on me, take me on
I′ll be gone In a day or_two
So needless to say
I′m odds and ends
But that′s me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK
Say after me
It′s no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me, take me on
I′ll be gone In a day or_two
the things that you say
Is it life or
Just a play my worries away
You′re all the things
I′ve got to remember
You′re shying away
I′ll be coming for you anyway
Take on me, take me on
I′ll be gone In a day or_two
na_na na_na na_na na
take on me
Theres something in the air
A whisper in my ear
And I cant get it out of my mind
Maybe these butterflies are
trying to tell us
Theres something here
that we need to find
I dont know what love
is up to these_days
But it sure seems
like its hanging around
Say you'll stay
Even_though we dont know
what this is all about
Guess well just have to wait
cause what we are
we will eventually figure_out
All I know is
that I want to be next to you
And right_now theres room
for the world
So wont you stay
Please say you'll stay
Dont you run_away just
because youre afraid
of something
that feels out of control
we can take our time
just give it a try
cause theres no harm
in taking it slow
We dont know what love
is up to these_days
But it sure seems
like its hanging around
Say you'll stay
Even_though we dont know
what this is all about
Guess well just have to wait
cause what we are
we will eventually figure_out
All I know is
that I want to be next to you
And right_now theres room
for the world
So wont you stay
Please say
Live each moment
Love every minute
Take every second by the hand
We dont have to worry
There isnt any hurry
Its all going to work out
in the end
in the end
We dont know what love
is up to these_days
But it sure seems
like its hanging around
Say you'll stay
Even_though we dont know
what this is all about
Guess well just have to wait

This_is start of something beautiful
This_is start of something new
You are the one that make me loose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh
And I throw it all away
Watch you fall_into my arms again
And I throw it all away
Watch you fall, now
You are the earth I will stand upon
You are the words I will sing
And I thrown it all away
Watched you fall_into his arms again
And I thrown it all away
Watched you fall, now
And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back, home
This_is start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new
Ohh oh_oh oh_oh
You were in college working
part time waiting tables
Left a small_town
never looked back
I was the flight risk
with the fear of fallin’
Wonderin’ why we bothered
with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As we’re lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes yes I can see it now
Do you remember we were
sittin’ there by the water
You put your arm around
me for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man’s careful_daughter
You are the best_thing
that’s ever been mine
Flash forward and we’re
taking on the world together
And there’s a drawer of
my things at your place
You learned
my secrets and you figure_out
why I’m guarded
You say we’ll never make
my parents’ mistakes
But we’ve got bills to pay
We got nothing figured_out
When it was hard to take yes yes
This_is what I thought about
Do you remember we were
sitting there by the water
You put your arm
around me for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man’s careful_daughter
You are the best_thing
that’s ever been mine
Do you remember
all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to
believe for the first_time
You made a rebel_of a careless
man’s careful_daughter
You are the best_thing
that’s ever been mine
Woah_oh ohh
And I remember
that fight 2 30 AM
Cause everything was
slippin’ right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you
followed me out into the street
Braced myself
for the goodbye
Cause that’s all
I’ve ever known
And you took me by_surprise
You said I’ll never
leave you alone
You said
I remember how we
felt sittin’ by the water
And every_time I look_at you
it’s like the first_time
I fell in love with a careless
man’s careful_daughter
She is the best_thing
that’s ever been mine
Oh_oh Make it last
Hold on Never turn back
You made a rebel_of a careless
man’s careful_daughter
You are the best_thing
that’s ever been mine
Woah_oh
Yeah_yeah Do you believe it
Woah_oh
We’re gonna make it now
Woah_oh
And I can see it yeah_yeah
And I can see it now
See it now See it now
You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Even_if you lose it, it will find you
There's_no way to stop it, but they'll try to
[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
[Verse_2]
Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your_lips
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even_if you lose me, I will find you
There's_no way to stop it, so don't try to
[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
[Bridge]
I used_to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no
[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah
Honey I'm so tired
I just want to ride easy on a slow_train
I ain't got a nickel
Honey, I ain't got a dime
But it's okay
I'm just tired_of the liquor
And the tremble in my fingers
And the cocaine
Honey I'm so tired
And I wanna ride easy on a slow_train
Oh yea
My love, do you feel me
This wasn't how I really saw it turning out
But everywhere I turn
A dream that used_to burn
Is always burning out
I can't hear another question
Or learn another lesson for the ones that I've learned always turned out less than I asked
Baby I'm sinking down fast
Honey I'm so tired
I just want to ride easy on a slow_train
I ain't got a nickel
Honey, I ain't got a dime
But it's okay
I'm just tired_of the liquor
And the tremble in my fingers
And the cocaine
Honey I'm so tired
And I wanna ride easy on a slow_train
Oh yea
Well what happened to the innoccence
Ah swear it was just right_here
But now I don't know where it went
My love do you hear me
You're lying right near me
But you're so far gone
And I'm so far_from home
And I don't know where we're_going
Down the road we're on
I've known people at the bottom going straight to the top
I've known people that were lucky
But I am not
But no
I guess it's not who I am
Honey I'm so tired
I just want to ride easy on a slow_train
I ain't got a nickel
Honey, I ain't got a dime
But it's okay
I'm just tired_of the liquor
And the tremble in my fingers
And the cocaine
Honey I'm so tired
And I wanna ride easy on a slow_train
Oh yea
Mmmmhmmm
Oh yea
I stop and listen sometimes
Clock myself into your eyes
And I can see what you see and I like it
I'm a fish in a blue sea and I like it
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't pick on me with your sympathy
I don't, I don't need you to love me
[Chorus]
Listen to the people who say
Lalalala,_lalalala
Lalalala,_lalalala
[Verse_2]
This snow is falling heavy
Wish my mother would come and get me
Forget all this makeup and fall in the red sea
Set the weight of each day like the leaves of our oak_tree
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't pick on me with your sympathy
I don't, I don't need you to love me
[Chorus]
Listen to the people who say
Lalalala,_lalalala
Everybody's moving away
Lalalala,_lalalala
Water pushes water away
Lalalala,_lalalala
[Bridge]
It's all good 'cause I feel it too
Hanging around with nothing to do
Make friends with the angels [?]
Maybe together we get in the good
[Chorus]
Lalalala,_lalalala
Lalalala,_lalalala
Lalalala,_lalalala
Lalalala, lalala
You ask me how are the days I spend with my only true love
And I tell you she shows me the summer with snow clouds above
You ask me how are the nights I spend with my only true baby
And I tell you she shows me the light
When my darkest hour shades me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same
You ask me how are the days now that my baby is gone
I’m troubled my friend, I know what is right but I do what is wrong
You ask me how are the nights now that my true love has left me
Well I drink and I dream of her still
But her vision, it only breaks me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same
When my darkest hour shades me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same
No it ain't the same
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
A little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine
Chorus
But when I taste_tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky_high in Colorado, your_lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste_tequila
When I taste_tequila
Verse_2
I can kiss somebody brand_new
And not even think_about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard
Chorus
When I taste_tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky_high in Colorado, your_lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya Need ya, when I taste_tequila
When I taste_tequila
Bridge
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in
Chorus
When I taste_tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky_high in Colorado, your_lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya Need ya, when I taste_tequila
When I taste_tequila
When I taste_tequila
When I taste_tequila
Ooh
Mother left you in the night
My_father faded into the same light
Now we're both hoping to find someone
[Verse_2]
I hope you hear this song
And you leave your old boyfriend
Come back where you belong
In my arms
[Chorus]
Kaitlin,_Kaitlin
Kaitlin,_Kaitlin
[Verse_3]
All of the days and the nights
You and I and a dream in Ojai
Filling up both of our_lives
With love
[Verse 4]
Sometimes you're like the wind
Like my mother sang in 1987
Now your life's sure to begin
[Chorus]
Kaitlin,_Kaitlin
Kaitlin,_Kaitlin
[Bridge]
All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll choose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love
[Verse 5]
Now you're gone again
I gave all that I had to give
But I lost my friend
[Verse 6]
Just before the holiday
Unable to learn my own name
Or blow the wind away
What would you say
[Chorus]
Kaitlin,_Kaitlin
Kaitlin,_Kaitlin
[Outro]
All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll choose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love
Thought I'd go and leave
Anyway
Time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life
You can't believe
That a match dipped
In gasoline
Has the power to lift
You from this dream
One I thought to leave
Now I'll go and lead
Anyway time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life
All the pills were green
And I swallowed them inside a sea
Of mercury
Then the fire came and burned your mind
And drowned you deep
When I thought to leave
Anyway time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life
The noose was clean
As I swung it on the blade on high
The fan did gleam
And it's revolutions turned my mind
Back indeed
When I thought to leave
Anyway time recalls
All your life
All your life
All your life
He was_born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was_born again
You might say he found a key for every door
When he first came to the mountains his life was far_away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the strings are already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long
But the Colorado_Rocky Mountain_high
I've_seen it raining fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky_Mountain high high_Colorado
Rocky_Mountain high high_Colorado
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every_step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
And the Colorado_Rocky Mountain_high
I've_seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky_Mountain high high_Colorado
Rocky_Mountain high high_Colorado
Now his life is full_of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a_couple more
More people, more scars upon the land
And the Colorado_Rocky Mountain_high
I've_seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky_Mountain high high_Colorado
Rocky_Mountain high high_Colorado
I make sparks
In awesome ways
The dripping tap
Consuming my head
Yeah you took off
With little conflict in your way
And I'm not good at winning fights anymore
I'm just a needle in the hay
I emptied out
The contents of my case and stayed a while
The heavy load I bore I wait a while
And bare the swelling of my curse
But I gave ground
A bit of shove so you would see
I won't be biting at my tongue anymore
I could be catching up on sleep
I made a b-line up to the gate
Met with your eyes and it was appalling
We took a rest sitting on our feet
These_are the memories I keep
We made the law but it shook the ground
Keeping it working was everything
That would keep it from all going down
And you're set up
And I lie down
And you're set up
And I lie down
Well Rosie
don't be scared
by the storm outside
We are safe and warm
we are home and dry
And though it rages on
there's_no need to cry
Oh Rosie
don't you worry my dear
For there are many_things
that I can not explain
Like the howling wind
like the pouring_rain
Like the love for a child
like the pin prick of pain
Oh Rosie
don't you worry my dear
Well Rosie
don't you think_about the things
that you can't change
For the world is cruel
and it's violent and strange
But there is beauty too
if you look the right way
Oh Rosie
don't you worry my dear
Oh_oh oh Rosie
don't you worry my dear
You know I like my chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday_night
A_pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk_about
But it's filled_with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little_bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday_night
A_pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
It's funny_how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price_tag on your clothes
There's_no dollar sign
On a peace of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree
Have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little_bit of chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday_night
A_pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
I thank_God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday_night
A_pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get a little chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday_night
A_pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you
Merry Christmas darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always somethin' new
But every day is a holiday
When I'm near to you
The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish
on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish
on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
i'm okay on my own but i like being with you
see everything in pink when you shift into view
loved you through summer, winter, spring, and fall
known you two years but i want them all
i sit in my room, i write too_many songs about you
i like how my name sounds next to yours
you're so far away, think_about you everyday
i just wish you lived next_door
do you think_about me still
when you hear my name, do you get a thrill
i wanna know if you feel it too
still, i know that i'd never tell you how i feel
no, i'd never spill these crushy feelings all over you
cause i'm way too scared of that
i don't wanna be a bother
i'm way too shy for that
i don't wanna be another girl who gets her heart broken in two
over you
i prefer my fantasy of you
i'm okay on my own but i like being with you
see everything in pink when you shift into view
loved you through summer, winter, spring, and fall
known you two years but i want them all
Well I’m just sitting on a fire escape
Killing time and keeping out of the way
Above a diver and a laundromat
Call my name and I will come on back
Anytime I need a glass to spill. Another ear to fill
To listen to me talk and won’t send me a bill
You tell it like it is and don’t ever make a sound
Here’s to my little ghost_town
Well I’m just sitting on a fire escape
Dropping pennies in the ally way
The storm drain behind the old motel
It’s like a personal wishing well
Pretty soon the sky went tangerine over black and green
Something real classic like a Hopper scene
I should go but I’m sure I’ll see you around
Here’s to my little ghost_town
Here’s to my little ghost_town
Alright alright
How can i start this rhyme
Don't wanna waste your time
Just let yourself be mine
Cause everytime you're around
My hair is going wild
You give me butterfiles
You make me lose my mind
Gonna make you shine
Gonna make you shine
I can make you shine
like the night
Gonna make you shine
Gonna make you shine
I can make you shine
like the night
Take me home
Take me home
I've_been lying_here all alone
Take me home
Take me home
And hold me
like you'll_never let me go
Take me home
Take me home
I've_been lying_here all alone
Take me home
Take me home
And hold me
like you'll_never let me go
Alright alright
Feels_like it's on the cards
This time we got it right
New place for you and i
Cause everytime you're around
My hair is going wild
You give me butterfiles
You make me lose my mind
Gonna make you shine
Gonna make you shine
I can make you shine
like the night
Gonna make you shine
Gonna make you shine
I can make you shine
Take me home
Take me home
I've_been lying_here all alone
Take me home
Take me home
And hold me
like you'll_never let me go
Take me home
Take me home
I've_been lying_here all alone
Take me home

And hold me

Don't let me go

No
Don't let me go
Yeah
The roses that I bought
you last week
Are just petals on the floor
by your feet
Nah they didn't stand a chance
And yeah girl I understand
You ain't got a damn clue I bet
But I see
broken_hearts trace your steps
And any time I hear the rain
I know just who to play blame
Baby what's it like
to watch the sky
throw stars down
For you and nobody_else
Baby it's dominoes
everywhere you go
And right_now I guess
Your gravity got me too
Everything_falls for you
Everything_falls for you
yeah mmm
I swear you could make
my jaw drop
And plans change baby
any time you want
Just by walking through the door
Or letting that dress
hit the floor
I'm like the strap
off your shoulder
The lights getting lower
Kissing you slower and slower oh
Baby what's it like
to watch the sky
throw stars down
For you and nobody_else
Baby it's dominoes
everywhere you go
And right_now I guess
Your gravity got me too
Everything_falls for you
Everything_falls for you oh
Baby what's it like
to watch the sky
throw stars down
For you and nobody_else
Baby it's dominoes
everywhere you go
And right_now I guess
Your gravity got me too
Everything_falls for you
Everything_falls for you
yeah mmm
It's coming 'round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day
This life, well, it's slipping_right through my hands
These_days turned out nothing like I had_planned
Control, well, it's slipping_right through my hands
These_days turned out nothing like I had_planned
It's coming 'round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
It settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day
Soon enough it comes
Here it is again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Undignified and lame
This life, well, it's slipping_right through my hands
These_days turned out nothing like I had_planned
Control, well, it's slipping_right through my hands
These_days turned out nothing like I had_planned
Soon enough it comes
This life, well, it's slipping_right through my hands
These_days turned out nothing like I had_planned
Control, well, it's slipping_right through my hands
These_days turned out nothing like I had_planned
Soon enough it comes
It's hot as hell already triple digits
My drink melts before I even sip it
Something tells me
It ain't about to cool
off anytime soon
With the way that you
Undress me with your eyes
It ain't even June
But boy I know that
I want you heatin'_up my summer
Keepin' me up all night
Don't you dare go make me wonder
What kissing you is like
Baby don't you wanna put your hands
On my body where the sun don't tan
I want you heatin'_up my summer
summer_summer summer_summer
I want you heatin'_up my summer
summer_summer summer_summer
My friend's friend's apartment
got a pool and
She_said he that it would be cool if
We sneak in we can
All summer long all summer long
I wanna be shotgunnin' your jeep
I wanna be smokin' all your weed
I want you getting SPF in
all the spots that I can't reach
I want you heatin'_up my summer
Keepin' me up all night
Don't you dare go make me wonder
What kissing you is like
Baby don't you wanna put your hands
On my body where the sun don't tan
I want you heatin'_up my summer

Don't know why
There's_no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all of the time
Oh yeah
Life_is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather, stormy weather
And I just can't get my poor self together
Oh I'm weary all of the time
The time, so weary all of the time
When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
Oh yeah if he stays away
Old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more
Oh I can't go on, can't go on, can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather, stormy weather
Since my man and I, me and my daddy ain't together
Keeps raining all of the time
Oh,_oh, keeps raining all of the time
Oh yeah,_yeah, yeah raining all of the time
Stormy stormy
Stormy weather
Yeah
Ninety nine white sheep
safe in the herd
One black sheep lost
we don’t say a word
But God’s looking down
on His child on the pavement
Leave the ninety nine behind
for the one that needs saving
Can’t say that you love
your neighbor
Can’t say that you love me
Can’t say All lives matter
He can’t breathe
Say his name
If you use your voice
Don’t just add to the white noise
Shouts in the hallway
they break down the door
And Breonna Taylor
is dead on the floor
And she would’ve been a nurse
if she hadn’t been another one
With 8 shots fired
from an officer’s gun
Can’t say Law and order
Or the land of the free
Can’t say All lives matter
When she can’t breathe
Say her name
If you use your voice
Don’t just add to the white noise
What have you done
Where is your brother
Ahmaud and Eric
Trayvon and George
What have you done
Where is your brother
Not one_more Not one_more
Can’t say Law and order
Or the land of the free
Can’t say All lives matter
They can’t breathe
Say her name
If you use your voice
Don’t just add to the white noise
Don’t just add to the white noise
I’m somewhere in Brooklyn
Think what could’ve been
What city you in
I don’t wanna call you
Then I wanna call you
I miss the old you
I think of a message to send
My phone is at seven percent
But when I go and try to reach you
I never can get through
I was the problem
Self-sabotaging
You had no option
You had to go when you had to go
And I couldn’t stop it
I was not willing to bend
You said it again and again
You need a heart
that better fits you
So you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow’s side
You changed your number
And got some friends
that I don’t recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too_late to try
If I change
Would you change your mind
Emotionally stranded
Left you abandoned
Took you for_granted
And I should’ve listened
Showed my commitment
When you said we’re drifting
If we could live in reverse
I’d go to the part where it hurt
I’d go and fix the little issues
Before they got too big
Is this all your way to try
to not remember me
A beautiful disguise
so you’re not who you were with me
But I think I know you so well
Enough that I think I could tell
Are you afraid to say you miss me
‘Cause you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow’s side
You changed your number
And got some friends
that I don’t recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too_late to try
If I change
Would you change your mind
Oh Yeah
Oh
Change your mind
Ummm
Yeah you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow’s side
You changed your number
And got some friends
that I don’t recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too_late to try
If I change
Would you change your mind
Oh
Um
would you change your mind
Only sometimes
I can't remember the last time
We sat at the table just the two of us
Looked into each_other's eyes
And made the choice to choose us
Let's trace the steps
of where we've_been
To make it feel like home again
And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place
where this all got started
Sometimes I wish
I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over
And fall all over each_other again
I know you remember that first night
I asked if you would wanna dance
You made me laugh in the neon_light
With your two left feet
telling me you can't
Let's trace those steps 'til we can find
Where we got lost in love that time
And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place
where this all got started
Sometimes I wish
I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over
And fall all over each_other again
Let's trace the steps
of where we've_been
To make it feel like home again
And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place
where this all got started
Sometimes I wish
I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over
And fall all over each_other
Do it all over
And fall all over each_other again
Little kid in a small_town
I did my best just to fit in
Broke my heart
on the playground mm
When they said I was different
Oh now
Now I'm all grown_up
and nothin' has_changed
Yeah it's still the same
It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences
far as you can see
If you think we live
in the land of the free
You should try to be black like me
My daddy worked day and night
For an_old house and a used car
Just to live that good life mm
It shouldn't be twice as hard
Oh now
Now I'm all grown_up and
nothin' has_changed
Yeah it's still the same
It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences
far as you can see
If you think we live
in the land of the free
You should try to be oh
black like me
Oh_oh oh_oh
Oh I know
I'm not
The only one
Oh yeah
Who feels
Like I
I don't belong
It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences
far as you can see
And if you think we live
in the land of the free
You should try to be oh
black like me
Oh and some day we'll all be free
And I'm proud to be oh
black like me
And I'm proud to be black like me
I'm proud to be black like me
Black like me
How can you
ever live life the best
With everything you love
Put to the test
And when you need to get
Something off your chest
I’m here for you
Here for you
Even_if you’re up
Just lying awake
And when you call me up
Just by mistake
I’ll always be just a phone
call away
I’m here for you
Here for you
Whenever you like it
I’m here for you
I’m here for you
Here for you
Call me anytime
Day or night
If you feel lonely
I’ll be there by your side
I pray pray pray
That you’re
Doing nothing crazy
I can’t imagine this world
Living life without you
How can you
ever live life the best
With everything you love
Put to the test
And when you need to get
Something off your chest
I’m here for you
Here for you
Even_if you’re up
Just lying awake
And when you call me up
Just by mistake
I’ll always be just a phone
call away
I’m here for you
Here for you
Whenever you like it
I’m here for you
I’m here for you
Here for you
Whenever you like it
I’m here for you
I’m here for you
Here for you
I can’t imagine this world
Living life without you
How can you

Just by mistake
I’ll always be just a phone

Verse_1
Comfort me
I promise when it's hard, I'll be lovely
I don't need to know your mother's name
But she would probably disagree
Verse_2
I don't need anything except to know that I can text
3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon
And you'll reply and come to me soon
Verse 3
Comfort me
Baby tiger's scratching at the door
She's seen someone she hasn't seen before
I'm okay, baby tiger
Verse 4
Don't prescribe me medication
I think that my mind is fine
I'm fully aware, it's just the time
Baby tiger's scratching at the door
Baby tiger's scratching at the door
Verse 5
Waiting_for this man to finish up
I'm okay, baby tiger
I'll come_back to me soon
I'll come_back to me soon
Baby tiger's scratching at the door
Verse_1
Used to have just one foot out the door
Yeah, I always wanted more
I always was the one
You thought would never marry
Used to be so wilfully obtuse, or is the word abstruse
Semantics like a noose, get out your dictionaries
Pre-Chorus
I'm gonna cut to the quick
This_is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These_are my true convictions
Chorus
So tell me, are you serious
Are you serious
Cause every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it
Verse_2
I see that you're down there and I'm up here
Your boyfriend's gone to get a beer
Leaving us crystal clear lines of communications
Promise me you won't avert your eyes
I'll drop my third-person disguise
You know it's time to do or die
No useless explanations
Pre-Chorus
I'm gonna cut to the quick
This_is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These_are my true convictions
Chorus
Tell me, are you serious
Are you serious
Every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it
Chorus fades to end
Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake_up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been_burning for so_many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads
[Chorus]
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change,_it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail_salon again
[Verse_2]
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been_burning for so_many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads
[Chorus]
'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen you'll grow out of
And all the times they will change,_it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon again
[Bridge]
Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means
[Chorus]
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change,_it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon
Maybe I'm just stoned_at the nail_salon again
You're the only one in the world
I wanna talk to right_now
The only one to pick me up
on a night like this
And I know
You'll be the first thing
on my mind in the morning oh
Sober or drunk
you're the one
that I just miss mmm
I said I wouldn't_call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin'_at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I could take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2_AM
And I just wanna
talk to my best_friend
I said I wouldn't_call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
But right_now
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine
and talk_about the past
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
Bought a drink for a girl
and I got her numbеr
Even thought about
walkin' her out that door mmm
The only thing that camе close
to you is her perfume oh
Got me wonderin'
what we gave it all up for oh-oh
I said I wouldn't_call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin'_at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I could take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2_AM
And I just wanna
talk to my best_friend
I said I wouldn't_call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
But right_now
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine
and talk_about the past
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
No no
Oh no
I should be moving on
You should be moving on babe
Yeah_yeah
'Cause I said I wouldn't_call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin'_at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I can take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2_AM
And I just wanna
talk to my best_friend
I said I wouldn't_call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
But right_now
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine
and talk_about the past (Oh-oh)
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
Every now and then the world needs a feel good song
'Cause sometimes life'll make you take the wrong way home
'Cause there's a road you know you shouldn't go down
You don't even feel at home in your hometown
Eight billion_people here and you still feel alone
[Pre-Chorus]
It could be me today
It could be you
But you know either way (Either way)
This_is what we'll do
[Chorus]
Pour a little out for someone_somewhere
Try to find a little_bit of light in the dark
In someone_somewhere
Tryna move on from a broken heart, yeah
Everybody's_gotta miss somebody
Everybody's_gotta go through a little hell
For the ones that didn't make it to the party
Everybody gon' pour a little out for someone_somewhere
Someone somewhere, yeah
[Verse_2]
Rush hour on a Friday
Seen a_couple folks broke_down on the highway
And they ain't even goin' my way
I'ma show a little love
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that could've been me today
It could've been you
But you know either way
This_is what we'll do
[Chorus]
Pour a little out for someone_somewhere
Try to find a little_bit of light in the dark
In someone_somewhere
Tryna move on from a broken heart, yeah
Everybody's_gotta miss somebody
Everybody's_gotta go through a little hell
For the ones that didn't make it to the party
Everybody gon' pour a little out for someone_somewhere
Someone somewhere
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that could've been me today (Could've been me)
It could've been you (Could've been you)
But you know either way (Either way)
This_is what we'll do (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
Pour a little out for someone_somewhere
Try to find a little_bit of light in the dark
In someone_somewhere
Tryna move on from a broken heart, yeah (Broken heart)
Everybody's_gotta miss somebody
Everybody's_gotta go through a little hell
For the ones that didn't make it to the party
Everybody gon' pour a little out for someone_somewhere (Somewhere)
Someone somewhere (Mm, yeah)
Evidence known so long
Oh God, I'm lost in my wrongs
Everything froze like stone
Saw your heart couldn't take much more
[Chorus]
My boy, I don't know why this life
Is so cruel and unkind, but it weighs on my heart
All joys were taken from your eyes
As the law would abide in murder and crime
Hard lines as the fossil defines
It's own shadow in lime and reveals how it dies
[Verse_2]
If anything goes, then everything's flawed
Oh my love, what the violence has caused
Malevolencе flowed from beyond
And my heart cannot takе much more
Oh joy I'm afraid of the light
As the jewel of my mind begins to fall_apart
Do not destroy what has taken its time
As the lord would abide in murder and crime
[Chorus]
Oh my love, I don't know why this life
Is so cruel and unkind but it weighs on my heart
Fading lines as the fossil denies
It's own shadow in the time to conceal how it died
[Outro]
Evidence known, march on
Oh God, I'm lost in the antiphon
Where does everything go when everything's gone?
For my heart cannot break much more
When the fire inside
that burns so bright
Begins to grow faded
It can be hard to see the ground
on which you stand
Though you may_not be afraid
of walkin' in the darkness
You will feel like a stranger in this land
You can try to carve a faith
out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry
out the bone
And the edges of the night may
cause you sorrow
You know I may_not be around
this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
Yeah, I'll always be with you
When the hope that you hold tightly
to has all but vanished
And there are no words
of comfort to be found
You will know what it means
to be lost and without love
May you fight to kill
that deafening sound
But our holy dreams
of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us
like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breakin' of the day
might bring you sorrow
You know I may_not be around
this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you
Ooh,_ooh, ooh,_ooh, ooh
Ooh,_ooh, ooh,_ooh, ooh,
ooh,_ooh, ooh,_ooh
Ooh,_ooh, ooh
You can try to carve a faith
out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry
out the bone
And the edges of the night may
cause you sorrow
You know I may_not be around
this time tomorrow
But our holy dreams
of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us
like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breakin' of the day
might bring you sorrow
You know I may_not be around
this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I will always be with you
I will always be with you
I'll always be with you
Looking outside lately
Like you've seen a ghost
Do you see right through me
See you wake_up slowly
When the light's already low
And the door starts closing
Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone_together
Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone so
Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you
When you see your memories
Are there versions of me there
Do they still mean something
Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone_together
Don't wanna live like this
Don't wanna live alone so
Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you
All I have left and all that I know
What is it worth and where do I go with
All I have left and all that I know
What is worth to know you
All I have left and all that I know
What is it worth and where do I go with
All I have left and all that I know
What is worth to know you
Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you
Love like you care
Do I do it for you anymore
Love like you care
Do I do it for you
Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
With people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes nor barley nor wheat
But there's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street
At_least when I asked them, that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I've found there, I might as well be
In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea
I believe that when writin' a wish you expressed
As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed
Well if you'll believe me, when asked to a ball
They don't wear no tops to their dresses at all
Oh, I've_seen them myself and you could not in truth
Tell it if they were bound for a ball or a bath
Don't be startin' them fashions now, Mary McRee
In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea
There's beautiful girls here, oh, never you mind
Beautiful shapes Nature never designed
Lovely complexions of roses and cream
But let me remark with regard to the same
That if at those roses you venture to sip
The colors might all come away on your lip
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waitin' for me
In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea
You remember young Diddy McClaren, of course
Well he's over here with the rest_of the force
I saw him one day as he stood on the Strand
Stopped all the traffic with a wave of his_hand
And as we were talking of days that are gone
The_whole town of London stood there to look on
But for all his great powers, he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea
I think I lost something in the water
I tried to swim to it
I could not swim to it
Drowned in a dream that should've make me stronger
I tried to swim through it
I could not swim through it
Leave my body and the party early
Cry on the train, playin' Justin Vernon
Such a long walk back to 30th
I have the dream again, I have the dream again
My_ego dies at the end, it's ego death
I live the dream like I still don't know what it meant
Who am I? I've lost the thread
My_ego dies at the end
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, ah, ah, ah
I lost the girl I was over a winter
I tried to cry for it
I could not cry for it
Sank down to search the bottom of the river
I tried to dive for it
I could not dive for it
Leave my body in the water early
Tried baptism but it felt_like burning
If I don't write about it, was it really worth it?
I have the dream again, I have the dream again
My_ego dies at the end, it's ego death
I live the dream like I still don't know what it meant
Who am I? I've lost the thread
My_ego dies at the end
Leave my body and my ego early
Kill it kind with a surgeon's mercy
Claim I put it out of its misery
I have the dream again, I have the dream again
My_ego dies at the end, it's ego death
I live the dream like I still don't know what it meant
Who am I? I've lost the thread
My_ego dies at the end
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, ah, ah, ah
If your life is like a tornado
You've_been living in black
and white
All you need is a smoke
and a rainbow
Honey let me give you a light
Alright
Let me give you a light
Yes queen go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions
in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies
Out in the country honey
y'all_means all
Y'all means all
Mmm y'all_means all
Hey
Maybe there's a little scratch
in your reflection
Maybe your rhinestone
lost its shine
Just count on love
and count your blessings
Count on me come on let's ride
Mmm
I got a big ol' bus so jump
on and ride
Yes queen go queen
Dip it like a dairy queen
Put your inhibitions
in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies
Out in the country honey
y'all_means all
Y'all means all
You can be born in Tyler TX
Raised with the Bible Belt
If you're torn
between the why's and exes
You ain't gotta play
with the hand you're dealt
Yes queen go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions
in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies
Out in the country honey
y'all_means all
Honey y'all_means all
Yes queen go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions
in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies
Out in the country honey

Honey y'all_means all
Honey y'all_means all
Hey
You're making my skin wanna crawl into all of these cracks and these crevices
Don't worry I know how to have a good time
Just don't need to smile to be enjoying myself
Don't put me on a shelf
I'm not here for your enjoyment, your amusement
I don't need to have a reason, no
Don't need to have a reason at all
Don't need to have a prince at my ball
How about right_now I'm my own prince
Maybe I wouldn't cease to exist
Without a man to do the hard things
Maybe you picked the wrong girl
But there's not one girl
Who deserves your aggression
I'll give you a confession
I used_to fall for this bullshit
But let's stop regressing
How about I take your patriarchy, your misogyny
And I put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit
[Refrain]
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit
[Chorus]
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit
Woo
[Outro]
It's already lit
I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tenneesse
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's last month's
two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound
of a door slam yet
Thank god I was an optimist
I drove circles_around this town
Tryin' to write_circles
around this town
Tryna say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin'_worth singin'_about
I've_been kind and I've_been ruthless
Yeah got here but the truth is
Thought when I hit it
it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal_down
Drivin'_circles around this town
So_many times
I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked
tryin' to compete_with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long_enough to
catch a break
A couple hundred songs
and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car
and the one about a church
That I wrote
Drivin'_circles around this town
Tryin' to write_circles
around this town
Tryna say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin'_worth singin'_about
I've_been kind and I've_been ruthless
Yeah got here but the truth is
Thought when I hit it
it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal_down
Drivin'_circles around this town
Drivin'_circles around this town
Hey

But I still got the pedal_down
I still get lost I still get found
Drivin'_circles around this town
Oh yeah
I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tenneesse
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank god I was an optimist
[Chorus]
I drove circles_around this town
Tryin' to write_circles around this town
Tryna say somethin' with meanin'

[Verse_2]
So_many times, I thought about lеavin'

Oh yeah
Sometimes I don't understand you
sometimes you don't understand me
Bridges are burnin' all over
but not on our street
Sometimes you take me for_granted
sometimes I can be backhanded
But you got my back
while I'm holdin' your hand
What else do we need
'Cause we're good friends
we don't ask why
We just show up
at each_other's house
unannounced
in the middle_of the night
We got history no conditions
You don't ever have to worry yeah
I'll keep you sturdy
'cause we're good friends
Some folks are fair weather
some just drift in and out
At my worst or my better
you always stick_around
And if we live to a hundred
or through to the next drink
I swear to God on my heart
nobody'll know you like me
'Cause we're good friends
we don't ask why
We just show up
at each_other's house
unannounced
in the middle_of the night
We got history no conditions
You don't ever have to worry yeah
I'll keep you sturdy
'cause we're good friends
Yeah eh eh
Too much love too_much dirt
too_much time
Wouldn't change
couldn't leave if we tried
Oh too_much love
too_much dirt too_much time
We wouldn't change
couldn't leave if we tried
'Cause we're good friends yeah

Yeah eh eh
'Cause we're good friends

It's no mystery it's a given
You don't ever have to worry yeah
I'll keep you sturdy
'cause we're good friends
Yeah good friends oh good friends
I watched him circle 'round the block, finally stopped at mine
Took a while before he knocked like all he had was time
"Excuse me, ma’am, maybe you can help, the directions weren't so clear
I'm looking_for Olivia Zand, they said I might find her here"
Well, I looked real hard and asked him, "What she’s got he's looking for?"
Said, "There's somethin' I think she'd wanna know" and I let him in the door
It's not like me to trust so quick, caught me by_surprise
But somеthin' about him gave me easе, right there in his eyes
[Chorus]
And just like that, your life can change if I hadn't looked away
My boy might still be with me now, he’d be twenty-five today
No knife can carve away the stain, no drink can drown regret
They_say Jesus brings you peace and grace, well, He ain’t found me yet
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
[Verse_2]
He sat down and took a deeper breath, then looked right in my face
I heard about the son you lost, how you left without a trace
I've spent years just_tryna find you so I could finally let you know
It_was your son’s heart that saved me, and a life you gave us both
[Chorus]
And just like that, your life can change, look what the angels send
I lay my head upon his chest and I was with my boy again
Well, I've spent so long in darkness, I never thought the night would end
But somehow, grace has found me, and I had to let Him in
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na, na, na-na-na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na, na, na-na-na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na-na-na,_na, na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Sheepskin Lady
How you made me
Dance and frolic like an alcoholic
A glass eyed fool
Jumping in the deep_end of a pool
Treading slowly
Barely floating
Reach your hand out but i fall flat
Right on my face
Sippin on a cigarette you smile
We're quick to fall
Back in my dear
Young and foolish
Blindly follow
Hidden footsteps with our eyes closed
Without regret
Come on babe lets take another
Without regret
Come on babe lets take another step
Take another step
Take another step
Take another
I know this hurts real bad right_now
I know you feel mad and sad right now, sad right_now
But the sky isn't falling, no no no, that's just the rain
It's safe to just call this
Pain
Girl, I've_been there, yeah life, it ain't_fair
It's okay to not be all right, just go 'head and cry
It might sound insane but I promise one day
You're gon' be thanking your lucky stars
For all this pain
Pain
Without the pain, how would you know
What things to change, and what stays the same
And which parts of you still have to grow
It can be ruthless, yeah, I've_been there too
But you're gonna get through this
Pain
Girl, I've_been there, yeah life, it ain't_fair
It's okay to not be all right, just go 'head and cry
It might sound insane but I promise one day
You're gon' be thanking your lucky stars
For all this pain
Pain
For all this pain, oh pain
The sky isn't falling, no no no, that's just the rain
It's safe to just call this
Pain
Girl, I've_been there, yeah life, it ain't_fair
It's okay to not be all right, just go 'head and cry
It might sound insane but I promise one day
You're gon' be thanking your lucky stars
For all this pain
For all this pain
Pain
For all this pain
Verse_1
Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears
Verse_2
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue old_pickup truck
You've_got nowhere to go although you're all gussied up
Verse 3
There's so_much whiskey in his coke it'll make her nose bend
But she swears that his love is a damn God sent
She's known God since she was a child
Verse 4
She used_to play in the yard and she would drеam of one day
Til the world came around and took hеr dreamin' away
Told her how to dress and act and smile
Bridge
She's_an Oklahoma smokeshow
He's an asshole from back home
She won't ever make it out alive
Bridge
That small_town bar scene
Where small vices kill your big dreams
He'd take you home but he's too drunk to drive
Chorus
I'll be here, I've_been up all night
Thinkin' about a life with you and I
One you'll_never know
'Cause you're a small_town smokeshow

Well I'll be here, I've_been up all night
Thinkin' about a life with you and I
One you'll_never know
'Cause you're a small_town smokeshow

I know your daddy ain't home so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears
Verse 6
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue old_pickup truck
You've_got nowhere to go although you're all gussied up
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Drop a needle on a vinyl and cry to old an Haggard song
Sittin'_at the table, baby breakin' the seal
Gonna see how_much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
[Chorus]
Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's_nothing to lose
I been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake_up everyday black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you
[Verse_2]
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til "I miss you" don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay_here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
[Chorus]
Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's_nothing to lose
I been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake_up everyday black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Well, I finally got a handle on you
[Outro]
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you
Handle on you
Yeah, I finally got a handle on you
Oh, what a scene
You were there dancing all free
The house band playing their closing theme
How I dared to dream
And for once it paid off
We’re on the run
Heart’s beating like a drum
The fever broken in the dark of the night
Your hand in mine
Waiting_for the sun
And I wanna be the man for a girl like you
The man I wanna be, I wanna be with you
Into the cold
Was it the liquor or love making us bold
You wrapped in a towel, holding me close
Those shivering bones
Just tell me when the feelings grow
And I wanna be the man for a girl like you
The man I wanna be, I wanna be with you
I could stay_here forever
Tell you all my fears
Hold you til my arms collapse
See your eyes in the ocean
All spinning in blue
Shining out through the black
Walking back to your place
Dancing around the conversation
The streetlight on your_face
Such a heavenly sight
And I wanna be the man for a girl like you
The man I wanna be, I wanna be with you
Intro
We're all in the same_boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes
We're all in the same_boat
Verse_1
We could all believe what we believe
Peacefully agree to disagree
But you can't judge a man
Until you walk a country mile in his shoes
Dood'n-doo-doo-doo
Chorus
We're all in the same_boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same_boat
Verse_2
We all been kicked and knocked around
But you ain't gonna keep a good man down
You can run like hell from your mistakes
But you can't hide from your truth
Rood'n-doo-doo-doo
Chorus
We're all in the same_boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same_boat
Bridge
Share them peaches if you're holdin'
Take those shots and keep reloadin'
If you can't be nice, don't say nothin' at all
So help somebody who might be strugglin'
Spread a little love, gotta give back somethin'
If this ship keeps rockin', we'll all go overboard
Chorus
We're all in the same_boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same_boat
Yeah, we're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same_boat
Thought we'd have a little more time
Before tomorrow's sun would rise
And wash out the stars from your eyes
You will go back to your life
And I'll have to go back to mine
Knowing the pain of life's design
To never be by your side
My photograph overexposed
Show me a part_of your world
It's just the same as mine
A familiar face in the clouds
Different maps and street signs
Though I can't be part_of your world
We can pretend just for a while
There's some other place I belong
And you will be safe in another's arms
Verse_1
We could walk down the street and
Our eyes wouldn't meet and
I could go to all the places we used_to go to
My heart would still beat, but
Wouldn't feel so incomplete and
I could meet the girl I'd be if I didn't know you
But, boy, I know you
Chorus
I wish we were better_strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed_in fairy_tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so_many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your_face
If you had never said my name
Love was morе than just a losin' game
I wish we werе better_strangers
Verse_2
Couldn't tell you how it feels
I got a pain that never heals
The kind that brings you to your knees
Hits you so hard that you can't breathe
Like you did to me
Chorus
I wish we were better_strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed_in fairy_tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so_many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your_face
If you had never said my name
Love was more_than just a losin' game
I wish we were better_strangers
Better strangers
Bridge
Wish I could take back all my secrets
Take back all my tears
Wish you were somethin' I didn't believe in
Like you were never here
I wish we were better_strangers
Better strangers
Chorus
I wish we were better_strangers
You never said all the right words
And I never believed_in fairy_tales
Yeah, I wish that I didn't know you
There's so_many things I would undo
And I'd still have all the wind in my sails
Yeah, if I had never seen your_face
If you had never said my name
Love was more_than just a losin' game
I wish we were better_strangers
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Verse_1]
Tell me, did you walk on water?
Do you know a woman named Jolene?
Can you claim me as your daughter?
Did you rock me to sleep? Pray for my soul to keep?
No, no, no, I don't think so, so, so
[Chorus]
You ain't Mama,_Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voices in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stones, I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama,_Dolly, or Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Verse_2]
Those three got a lot in common
The kinds you wanna have a drink with
'Cause they love people at rock bottom
And they ain't gonna sit when there's a table to flip
So get off my back if you can't say that, that, that
[Chorus]
You ain't Mama,_Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voicеs in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stonеs, I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama,_Dolly, or Jesus
[Bridge]
I can't pay my rent with your two cents
So keep it to yourself
And when I get lost, can't bear the cross
I know who can help (I know who can help)
[Chorus]
Mama,_Dolly, or Jesus
They're the only voices in my head that I tend to agree with
So pick your bones and throw your stones, I ain't inclined to please you
Unless you're Mama,_Dolly, or Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Chorus]
Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there_ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some_shit
[Verse_1]
That you'd hate to grow_up and miss
Hate to think of what if
I didn't even know what a honey hole with a Zebco
And my jeans rolled and a pinch of Skoal in my lip even is
They_say we ain't got a pot to piss but I thank_God for this
[Chorus]
Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that somе thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lanе road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there_ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some_shit
Ain't that some,_ain't that some,_ain't that some_shit
Yeah
[Verse_2]
My true North is due South with a blue Coors goin' down
Just like that settin' sun on my old Z-71
I know it's cliché to sing Chevrolets, cold beers and Fridays
But that's just the way it is out here
[Chorus]
Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there_ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some_shit
Ain't that some,_ain't that some,_ain't that some_shit
[Chorus]
Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there_ain't T-R-Y-D this
(Ain't) Ain't that some back home
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, we'll be doin' this 'til the day we die
There's folks out there_ain't T-R-Y-D this
(Ain't) Ain't that some_shit
Ain't that some,_ain't that some,_ain't that some_shit
Ain't that some,_ain't that some_shit
If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last
[Pre-Chorus]
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At_least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes
[Chorus]
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even_if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart_breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway
[Verse_2]
I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there_ain't words been made could shoulder so_much weight
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change
[Chorus]
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even_if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart_breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway
[Chorus]
There’s just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even_if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart_breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway
[Outro]
Even_if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart_breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway
What would it take to break the curse?
I found another universe
One who would have me
One I would belong
I'm growing tired_of the offense
Fateful design, omnipotence
Whether to use both my hands for love
For love
For love
All I've wanted, I
Am transported to another plane
When I close my eyes and lay me down
Oh, when I close my eyes and lay me down
If I created my own world
Minds would be open and unfurled
I'd navigate a way out of the storm
There would be no more hurt or pain
Deliverance would end its wage
The galaxy would be a guide for love
For love
For love
All I've wanted, I
Am transported to another plane
When I close my eyes and lay me down
Oh, when I close my eyes and lay me down
Call me by your name again
So I remember how to love
I’ll make fun of you
to your parents again
You make magic with your touch
When you’re in it
you think that it’s different
From anything you’ve had before
But when you’re drinking,
not thinking and really never
listening
It’s not weird
that things got worse
So wake me up when it’s over
I know you’re not sober anymore
Eighteen in your kitchen
you’re legal in England
but I’m not
You’d play strings and I would
dance around with nothing
but my makeup on
I make it sound so poetic
but that really never happened
It’s just something I dreamt up
So wake me up when it’s over
we’re_both not sober anymore
Nineteen we’re not talking
I’m finally in Scotland
and you’re not
Feeling like a piece_of space
trying so hard not to fade away
Weightlessness is never around
cause you’re just a force
holding me down
Holding me
Holding me
Holding me down
Holding me down
Holding me down
So wake me up when it’s over
we’re_both not sober anymore
Eighteen in your kitchen
you’re legal in England
but I’m not
I made a case for you to love me
I made a case but you disagreed
Now I’m holding on for dear life
as this ship sinks way out of sight
I want to hold you again like before
I want to lay down my world at your door
you say you’ll miss me I’ll miss you more
time won’t heal this heart
I made a case to ride the storm out
wave after wave through distance and doubt
I keep holding on to your love
Even when you have given up
I want to hold you again like before
I want to lay down my world at your door
you say you’ll miss me I’ll miss you more
time won’t heal this heart
Truth stands in place
While silent storms roar
When love shows her face
The wind whispers cures
And I will always be yours
I want to hold you again like before
Still want to lay down my world at your door
You say you’ll miss me I’ll miss you more
Time won’t heal this heart
Time won’t heal this heart
This barstool knows my name by now
Midnight longneck lost and found
Asking everyone in town
If they've_seen that girl
That girl that went and done me wrong
Turned me to a country_song
Kind that bars play all night long
Jukebox full_of Merle
Ooh, took a page out the get gone book
Ooh, and I don't where to look
She might be west of Texas, east of Tennessee
Could be Colorado, oh,
all I know is that she ain't here with me
Since it went south, taillights in a dust cloud
Left me, and she left me wonderin'
where the hell she's at
That girl put_heartbreak on the map
She got me runnin' around
She got me spinnin' in circles
She ain't comin' back
That girl put_heartbreak on the map
Didn't leave me with a goodbye kiss
Just a little whiskey on my lips
And this lonesome state I'm in
Ain't getting no better
Ooh
Got a 30A bumper sticker
Ooh, if you see her let her know I miss her
She might be west of Texas, east of Tennessee
Could be Colorado, oh,
all I know is that she ain't here with me
Since it went south, taillights in a dust cloud
Left me, and she left me wonderin'
where the hell she's at
That girl put_heartbreak on the map
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh,_oh, oh,_oh
This barstool knows my name by now
Midnight longneck lost and found
Asking everyone in town
If they've_seen that girl
If they've_seen that girl, if they've_seen that girl
She might be west of Texas, east of Tennessee
Could be Colorado, oh,
all I know is that she ain't here with me
Since it went south, taillights in a dust cloud
Left me, and she left me wonderin'
where the hell she's at
That girl put_heartbreak on the map
She got me runnin' around
She got me spinnin' in circles
She ain't comin' back
That girl put_heartbreak on the map
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh,_ooh
Heartbreak on the map
That girl put_heartbreak on the map
It_wasn't even half as far as I thought it'd be
It_was barely out of town
Somewhere in between a creek
and some evergreens
She was showing me around
I swore I saw a halo
Hanging over her head
I didn't know I needed saving
But that's just what she did
Last night, I went to heaven and back,
and I stayed there for a while
I danced with an_angel till the stars went black,
last_night, I went to heaven and back
She took my hand, and I saw the light,
and I hope I'm going back tonight
Hey!
There was something 'bout the way
that she held me close
There was magic in her eyes
Watched her put a little gold on a gravel road
Turned the water into wine
Sunday morning's got nothing on her
You might not believe it, but I'm pretty sure
Last night, I went to heaven and back,
and I stayed there for a while
I danced with an_angel till the stars went black,
last_night, I went to heaven and back
She took my hand, and I saw the light,
and I hope I'm going back tonight
Hey!
I swore I saw a halo
Hanging over her head
I didn't know I needed saving
But that's just what she did
Last night, I went to heaven and back,
and I stayed there for a while
I danced with an_angel till the stars went black,
last_night, I went to heaven
Last night, I went to heaven and back,
and I stayed there for a while
I danced with an_angel till the stars went black,
last_night, I went to heaven and back
She took my hand, and I saw the light,
and I hope I'm going back tonight
Hey!
It_wasn't even half as far as I thought it'd be
It_was barely out of town
Treat myself
Top top shelf
What's under that tree want it all to myself
North Pole elf
Better work like hell
I want 14 carrot jingle bells
I'm sorry im not_sorry
Call me naughty call me nice
When i wake_up in the morning
On 12/25
I want a hot_pink Christmas
A little Rose gold Tiffany too
I know I'm on that nice list
Tell me santa when you come through
Can I drip drip diamonds and tinsel too
Cause I've_been a good bad girl the whole year thru
I want a hot_pink Christmas
Don't you don't you don't you
Deck the halls with money_money
Tis the season keep up honey
Hot pink sleigh (slay)
hot_pink suit
Clickety click in hot_pink boots
Hot pink Birkin gimme gimme gimme
Shimmy on down that hot_pink chimney
I'm sorry im not_sorry
Call me naughty call me nice
When i wake_up in the morning
On 12/25
I want a hot_pink Christmas
A little Rose gold Tiffany too
I know I'm on that nice list
Tell me santa when you come through
Can I drip drip diamonds and tinsel too
Cause I've_been a good bad girl the whole year thru
I want a hot_pink Christmas
Don't you don't you don't you
Deck the halls with money_money
Tis the season keep up honey
Dawn we now hot_pink apparel
Grab your girls and sing this Carol
When I was a babe I feel down in the holler
When I was a girl I fell into your arms
We fell on hard times and we lost our bright color
You went to the dogs and I lived_by my charms
I danced for my dinner, spread kisses like honey
You stole and you gambled and I said you should
We sang for our suppers, we drank up our money
Then one day you left saying I was no good
Well, all right, I’m bad, but then you’re no prize either
All right, I’m bad, but then that’s nothing new
You say you won’t love me, I won’t love you neither
Just let me remind you who I am to you
‘Cause I am the one who looks out when you’re leaping
I am the one who knows how you were_brave
And I am the one who heard what you said sleeping
I’ll take that and more when I go to my grave
It’s sooner than later that I’m six feet under
It’s sooner than later that you’ll be alone
So who will you turn to tomorrow, I wonder?
For when the bell rings, lover, you’re on your own
I am the one who you let see you weeping
I know the soul that you struggle to save
Too bad I’m the bet that you lost in the reaping
Now what will you do when I go to my grave
I will tread down a lonesome track
Set my eyes on the wild and won't look back
I will follow where my heart reacts
Venture out to the great unknown
Find a place where I can feel alive again
Throw caution to the wind
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
Climbing up from the valley below
Seeing places and faces I've never known
I will follow to the open road
Through the trees 'til I see the sun
Now I know that I can feel alive again
Throw caution to the wind
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
Step by step I come alive
Lift my head up to the skies
Won't look back I'll chase the sun
Live the life I'm dreaming of
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
I'll find my feet on the way
When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even
your darkness night
You just call out my name
And you know whenever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've_got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full_of clouds
And that old north
winds begin to blew
Keep your head together
And call my name out_loud
Soon you'll hear me
knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know whenever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
yes i will you do
now Ain't it good to know that
you've_got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let_them
Oh but don't you let_them
You just call out my name
And you know whenever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter spring summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
yes i will
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend
Ain't it good to know
You've_got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend
Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while
I was sleeping
And the vision
that was planted in my_brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In_restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar
to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
by the flash of a neon_light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs
that voices never share
And no_one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
'Fools' said I
'You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that
I might teach you
Take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words like
silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed
out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said
'The words of
the prophets are written
on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd
in the sounds of silence
Seen a shooting_star tonight
And I thought of you.
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew.
I always kind_of wondered
If you ever made it through.
Seen a shooting_star tonight
And I thought of you.
Seen a shooting_star tonight
And I thought of me.
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or
Over-step the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting_star tonight
And I thought of me.
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying,
It's the last temptation
The last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
The last radio is playing.
Seen a shooting_star tonight
Slip Away.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Guess it's too_late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say.
Seen a shooting_star tonight
Slip away.
Clearly we won't know unless we try
The possibilities are open
To create a new situation
Surely we won't know unless we try
I am far too_young to die
Tell me about the general people
My belly's bursting without a
And who are the general people?
Just a grain of sense that you confess
I have regrets if I die
Refuge in superstitions and dreams
Toying with the imaginary
Memory becomes a luxury
Refuge in superstitions and dreams
It's no way to make history
No we won't know, we won't know
We won't know unless we try
Hey_hey Hey_hey baby hey
Hey_hey Hey_hey baby hey
I love you baby
Sure ain't gonna be your dog

All I can say is hey
Hey_hey Hey_hey baby hey
Hey_hey Hey_hey baby hey

Sure ain't gonna be your dog
Hey_hey lost your good thing now
Hey_hey You lost your good thing now
You had me fooled
I found it out somehow
Sorry
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry like sorry
Forgive me
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me forgive me
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time you'd be mine
I love you
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you I love you
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time you'd be mine
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time you'd be mine
How_many roads must
a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How_many seas must
a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How_many times must
the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The Answer my friend

How_many times must
a man look up
before he can see the sky
How_many ears must

바람이 불러주는 노래
얼마나 더 먼
길을 가야만
사람들은 사람다워질까?
얼마나 더 멀리
바다를 날아가야만
비둘기는 쉴 수 있을까?
얼마나 더
많은 포탄이 터져야만
피비린내 나는 싸움이 끝날까?
친구여, 묻지 말아요
오직 바람만이 알고 있는데.
얼마나 더
우러러 보아야
푸른 하늘이 보일까?
얼마나 더
많이 귀기울여야
울음소리가 들릴까?
Who Doesn't Know What I'm Talking About
Who's Never Left Home, Who's Never Struck Out
To Find A Dream And A Life Of Their Own
A Place In The Clouds, A Foundation Of Stone
Many Precede And Many Will Follow
A Young Girl's Dream No Longer Hollow
It Takes The Shape Of A Place Out West
But What It Holds For Her, She Hasn't Yet Guessed
She Needs Wide Open Spaces
Room To Make Her Big Mistakes
She Needs New Faces
She_Knows The_Highest Stakes
She Travelled This Road As A Child
Wide Eyed And Grinning, She Never Tired
But Now She Won't Be Coming Back With The Rest
If These Are Life's Lessons, She'll Take This Test
Repeat Chorus
She_Knows The_Highest Stakes
As Her Folks Drive Away,
Her Dad Yells, Check The Oil!
Mom Stares Out The Window And Says,
I'm Leaving My Girl
She Says, It Didn't Seem Like That Long Ago
When She Stood There And Let Her Own Folks Know
She Needed Wide Open Spaces
Room To Make Her Big Mistakes
She Needs New Faces
She_Knows The_Highest Stakes
She_Knows The_Highest Stakes
She_Knows The_Highest Stakes
She_Knows The_Highest Stakes
She_Knows The_Highest Stakes

Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look_out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're_doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Face full_of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D. A.
Look_out kid
Don't matter_what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try "No Doz"
Better stay away_from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind_blows

Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail

You're gonna get hit
But users, cheaters
Six-time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters

Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look_out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work

Half of your love is just
not what I'm after
Part of your world is just
not what I need
Some of your time is like
one glass of water
Just leaves me
thirsty for wine
So fill me up to the top
Wo don't you stop
till I'm over flowing
Love is the seed
and babe I need you
To keep it growing
Stronger every day
Oh no
Don't take me half the way
Don't take me half the way
Never before have I
settled for second
All of my life I have
hungered for more
Now I can see where your
sweet love can lead me
This_is what I've waited for
So fill me up to the top
Wo don't you stop
till I'm over flowing
Love is the seed
and babe I need you
To keep it growing
Stronger every day
Oh no
Don't take me half the way
Don't take me half the way

My daddy was the family bassman
My mamma was an engineer
And I was_born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears
In my ears
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair_of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines_feel
Ba ba_ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines_feel
Shine a light
My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mamma's in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve
I did not serve
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair_of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines_feel
Ba ba_ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines_feel
Ba mmm ba_ba ba_ba
My daddy got a big promotion
My mamma got a raise in pay
There's_no one home
we're all alone
Oh come into my room and play
Yes we can play
I'm not talking
about your pigtails
But I'm talking
'bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines_feel
Ba ba_ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines_feel
Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves
Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes
Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time
If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river_flows
And all night shows
In summertime
Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or_maybe stay
She wasn't sure
For when she thought
of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more
Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free
If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river_flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me
Oh how they come and go
Oh how they come and go
Strange face with your eyes
So pale and sincere
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came
to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung
You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight
But while the earth
sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave
So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song
And if one day you should
see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud
Clouds, one by one, fill the sky
Just like these tears that fill my eyes
I know by now she ain't comin' back
I watch my world slowly fade into black
Look_out my window it's still_rainin'
Look_out my window it's still_rainin'
They_say that time heals everything
I've felt the pain that love can bring
It don't get no better with each passing day
Any hope I had is slowly slipping away
Look_out my window, it's still_rainin'
Look_out my window, it's still_rainin'
I thought the morning would rescue me
But the rain keeps falling endlessly, endlessly
Sometimes I wonder what'll become of me
There_ain't much left of what I used_to be
Her love shone on me like the morning_light
Now here I am alone again tonight
Look_out my window, it's still_rainin'
Look_out my window, it's still_rainin'
I woke_up this morning my head felt dense
I splashed it with water trying to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen she was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink_of an_eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
Well it's her way of saying she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every_time
When my_brain starts smokin' and I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink_of an_eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
In this complicated world it may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cures
Pushed to the limit or standing at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink_of an_eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink_of an_eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
see the curtains hangin' in the window in the evening on a friday night
little light is shinein' through the window let's me now everything's alright
summer breeze, makes me feel fine don't indure the jasmine in my mind
summe breeze, makes me feel fine don't indure the jasmine in my mind
see the paper layin' in the sidewalk a little music from the house next_door
so i walk on up to the doorstep through the screen and I close the door
summer breeze, makes me feel fine don't indure the jasmine in my mind
summer breeze, makes me feel fine don't indure the jasmine in my mind
sweet day's in summer, the jasmine in bloon you light each dressed up and playing her tune
and i come home from a hard day's work and your waiting the there without a care in the world
see the smile that wains in the kitchen cool pickin and a place for two feel the arms that reach out to hold me in the evening when the day is through
summer breeze, makes me feel fine don't indure the jasmine in my mind
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
All around in my home town
They're trying to
track me down
They_say they want to bring me
in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say
I shot the sheriff
but I swear it was in
self defense
I shot the sheriff
and they say it is a
capital offense
Sheriff John Brown
always hated me
For what I don't know
Every_time that I plant a seed
He said
Kill it before it grows
He said
Kill it before it grows
I say
I shot the sheriff
but I swear it was in
self defense
I shot the sheriff
but I swear it was in
self defense
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden
I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot I shot him down
I say
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket
goes to the well
But one day the bottom
will drop out
Yesone day the bottom
will drop out
But I say
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
oh no
I shot the sheriff
but I did not shoot the deputy
oh no
Standing at the crossroads
trying to read the signs
To tell me which way
I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant_your love and
let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
Looking_for a reason
to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend
that I can count on
But there's_nothing left to show
Plant_your love and
let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
let it grow
let it grow
Time is getting shorter
and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get
what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant_your love and
let it grow
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it
Let it grow let it grow
Let it blossom_let it flow
In the sun the rain the snow
Love is lovely
let it grow
I am just a poor boy
Though my story is seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles,
Such are promises,all lies, and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest Mm mm....
When I left my home and my family
I was no more_than a boy
In the company of strangers,
In the quiet of a railway station
Running scared, laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking_for the places only they would know
Lie-la-lie
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking_for a job
But I get no offers
Just a "come on" from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so_lonesome
I took some comfort there Ooo-la-la
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New_York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till_he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still_remains
faded photographs
the feelings all come_back
even now sometimes
you feel so near
and I still see your_face
like it was yeasterday
it's strange how the days_turned into years
years of hanging on
to dreams are already gone
years of wishing you were here
after all this time you'd think I wouldnt cry
it's just that I still love you after all these_years
nighttime gently falls
another day is gone
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
in case you come_back home
but I've_been saying that for years
years of hanging on
to dreams are already gone
it's of wishing you were here
after all this time you'd think I wouldnt cry
it's just that I still love you after all these_years
after all these_years
And here's to you

just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all
you've_got to hide it
from the kids
Coo coo ca choo

Well, I'm tore_down
I'm almost_level with the ground
Well, I'm tore_down
I'm almost_level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found
Well, I went to the river
To jump in
My baby showed up and said
'I will tell you when'
Well, I'm tore_down
I'm almost_level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found
I love you baby
With all my heart an' soul
A love like mine will never grow old
I love you in the mornin'
And in the evenin', too
But ev'rytime you leave me
I get mad with you
Well, I'm tore_down
I'm almost_level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found
I love you, baby with all my might
A love like mine is out of sight
I'll lie for you if you want me to
I really don't believe your love is true
Well, I'm tore_down
I'm almost_level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found
A-well I'm tore_down
I'm almost_level with the ground
Well, I'm tore_down
I'm almost_level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found.
Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy
I've_been walking these streets so long
Singing the same_old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle is the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are_shining on me
후렴 : Like a rhinestone_cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone_cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone
Well I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're_riding a train
That's taking the long way
And I dream of the thing I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are_shining on me
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
You'll have bad times and he'll have good_times
Doing things that you don't understand
But if you love him please forgive him
Even_though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, whoa be proud of him
'Cause after all he's just man
Stand_by your man
Give him to arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When the nights are cold and lonely
Stand_by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand_by your man
And if you love him, whoa be proud of him
'Cause after all he's just a man
Stand_by your man
Give him to arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When the nights are cold and lonely
Stand_by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand_by your man
Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see
Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
I was twenty one years
when I wrote this song
twenty two now
but I won't be for long
Time hurries on
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown
And they wither in the wind
And they crumble in your hand
Once my heart was filled
with the love of a girl
I held her close
but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown
And they wither in the wind
And they crumble in your hand
I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripple run_away
And they never made a sound
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown
And they wither in the wind
And they crumble in your hand
Hello hello hello hello
Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye
That's all there is
And the leaves that are green
turn to brown
I hear the drizzle of the rain
like a memory it falls
soft and warm continuing
tapping on my roof and walls
And from the shelter of my mind
through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain
drenched streets
to England where my heart lies
My minds distracted and diffused
my thoughts are many miles_away
they lie with you and you're asleep
kiss you when you start your day
and the song
I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
writing songs I can't believe
with words that tear and
strain to rhyme
and so you see I have come to doubt
all that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
the only truth I know is you
and as I watch the drops of rain
weave thier weary paths and I
I know that I am like the rain
there but for the grace of you go I
There_is a village
hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a Sunday_morning
Little Jimmy Brown was_born
All the chapel bells were ringing
in the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
was for baby Jimmy Brown
Then the little congregation
prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love
There_is a village
hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years there after
Jimmy was to meet his love
All the chapel bells were ringing
was a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing
was for Jimmy and his wife
Then the little congregation
prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
bless, oh Lord this celebration
May their lives be filled_with love
From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Little Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just a lonely bell was ringing
in the little valley town
Was farewell that it was singing
to our little Jimmy Brown
And the little congregation
prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
may his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love
When you`re feeling lonely, lost and let down
Seems_like those dark skies are following you around
And life`s just one big shade of gray
You wonder_if you`ll see the light of day
[chorus]
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even_though you can`t quite make it out
You may_not see the silver lining
But there`s a big blue_sky waiting just behind the clouds
I`ve heard it said that this too shall pass
Good times or bad times, neither one lasts
But thinking that your luck won`t ever change
Is like thinking it won`t ever stop once it starts to rain
[chorus]
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even_though you can`t quite make it out
You may_not see the silver lining
But there`s a big blue_sky waiting just behind the clouds
Yeah, there`s a big blue_sky waiting just behind the clouds
If tomorrow all the things were gone,
I？d worked for all my life.
And I had to start again,
with just my children and my wife.
I？d thank my lucky stars,
to be living here today.
？Cause the flag still stands for freedom,
and they can？t take that away.
And I？m proud to be an American,
where at_least I know I？m free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
who gave that right to me.
And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
？Cause there ain？t no_doubt I love this land,
God_bless the USA.
From the lakes of Minnesota,
to the hills of Tennessee.
Across the plains of Texas,
From sea to shining sea.
From Detroit down to Houston,
and New_York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart,
and it's time we stand and say.
That I？m proud to be an American,
where at_least I know I？m free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
who gave that right to me.
And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
？Cause there ain？t no_doubt I love this land,
God_bless the USA.
And I？m proud to be and American,
where at_least I know I？m free.
And I won't forget the men who died,
who gave that right to me.
And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
？Cause there ain？t no_doubt I love this land,
God_bless the USA
I’m sittin’ in the railway station
Got a ticket for my destination
On a tour of one night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one man band
Homeward_bound I wish I was
Homeward_bound
Home,_where my thought’s escaping
Home,_where my music’s playing
Home,_where my love lies_waiting
Silently_for me
Everyday’s an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger’s face I see
Reminds me that I long to be
Homeward_bound I wish I was
Homeward_bound
Home,_where my thought’s escaping
Home,_where my music’s playing
Home,_where my love lies_waiting
Silently_for me
Tonight I’ll sing my songs again
I’ll play the game and pretend
But all my words come_back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptyness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me
Homeward_bound I wish I was
Homeward_bound
Home,_where my thought’s escaping
Home,_where my music’s playing
Home,_where my love lies_waiting
Silently_for me
Silently_for me
Silently_for me -
Morning_has broken
like the first morning
Blackbird has_spoken
like the first bird
Praise_for the singing
praise for the morning
Praise_for the springing
fresh from the world
Sweet the rain's new fall
sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall
on the first grass
Praise_for the sweetness
of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
where his feet pass
Mine is the sunlight
mine is the morning
Born of the one light
eden saw play
Praise with elation
praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day
Morning_has broken
ike the first morning
Backbird has_spoken
like the first bird
Praise_for the singing
praise for the morning
Praise_for the springing
fresh from the world
Livin' on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast_as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Well, Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dyin' words
Ah but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
Could of had him any_day
Only let him any_day
Hang around
Out of kindness I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used_to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to gop
There_ain't nobody knows
Well, the poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The dessert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
So the story end's, we're told
Pancho needs your prayer's it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He just did what he had to do
And now he's growin' old
A few gray Federales say
Could have had him any_day
Only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose
I don't know when I've_been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone_new
And don't it make my brown_eyes blue
I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown_eyes blue
Tell me no secrets tell me some lies
Give me no reasons give me alibis
Tell me you love me
and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say_goodbye
I didn't_mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown_eyes
Don't it make my brown_eyes
Don't it make my brown_eyes blue
Don't it make my brown_eyes
Don't it make my brown_eyes
Don't it make my brown_eyes blue
Don't it make my brown_eyes
Don't it make my brown_eyes
Don't it make my brown_eyes blue
Tell me baby tell me
Are you still on the stoop
Watching the windows close
I've not seen seen you lately
On the street, by the beach
Or places we used_to go
I've a picture of you
On our favorite day by the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought out from under my nose
Tell me baby tell me
Does his company make
Light of a rainy day
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak
And all that we wouldn't say
Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing you believe in
Or a bit like a bird stealing bread
Out from under your nose
Tell me baby tell me
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change
I've_been thinking lately
of a night on the stoop
and all that we wouldn't say
If I see you again
On the street, by the beach
In the evening
Will you fly like a bird stealing bread
Out from under my nose
oh i do believe
in all the things you see
what comes is better
than what came_before
and you better
come come come come to me
you better comecome comecome to me
better run run run run to me you better come
ohoh i do believe
in all the things you see
what comes is better
than what came_before
you better run run run run to me
you better run run run run to me
you better come come come come to me
you better run
Say you're sorry
That face of an_angel
Comes out just when you need
it to As I paced back
and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed_in you
Holding on The days drag on
Stupid girl I should have known
I should have known
I'm not a princess
this ain't a fairy_tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep
off her feet Lead her up
the stairwell This ain't Hollywood
this is a small_town
I was a dreamer before
you went and let me down
Now it's too_late for you
And your white_horse
to come around Baby I was naive
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't wanna be in
love You had to fight to have
the upper_hand I had so_many
dreams About you and me
Happy endings Now I know
I'm not a princess
this ain't a fairy_tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep
off her feet Lead her up
the stairwell This ain't Hollywood
this is a small_town
I was a dreamer before you
went and let me down
Now it's too_late for you
And your white_horse
to come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness
begging for me Just like I always
wanted but I'm so sorry
Cause I'm not your princess
this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
This_is a big world
that was a small_town
There in my rearview mirror
disappearing now And its too_late
for you and your white_horse
Now its too_late for you
and your white_horse
to catch me now
Try and catch me now
Oh it's too_late To catch me now
And it's a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets
What you wanted again
You know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history
And you're getting sick of it
But i believe in whatever you do
And i'll do_anything
to see it through
Because these_things will change
Can you feel it now
These_walls that they put up
To hold us back
Will fall down
It's a revolution
The time will come
for us to finally_win
We'll sing_hallelujah
We'll sing_hallelujah oh
So we've_been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight
When the fight ain't_fair
We're getting stronger now
From things they never found
They_might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared
You can walk_away
Say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
cause these_things will change
Can you feel it now
These_walls that they put up
To hold us back
Will fall down
It's a revolution
The time will come
for us to finally_win
We'll sing_hallelujah
We'll sing_hallelujah oh
Tonight we'll stand and get
off our knees
Fight for what
we've worked for All these_years
The battle was long
It_was the fight of our_lives
But we'll stand up
champions tonight
It_was the night things changed
Can you see it now
The walls that they put up
To hold us back
Fell down It's a revolution
Throw your hands up
cause we never gave in
We'll sing_hallelujah
We sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
Baby, you don't even know me but one day I'll get up the courage as you pass by.
You'll see.
Oh baby, one look just might save me.
I need you to slow by the corner.
Stop right in front_of me.
Till then I'll see you hopefully through.
I do wish that you'd ask me to ride along.
It wouldn't be wrong to tell me more_than I know about you.
[Chorus]
She drives a vegetable car.
Diesel, Mercedes, green, two-door.
I barely know who you are.
Lisa Lobe glasses.
I'd sure like to ask you to stay.
Baby, I need you to save me.
The one_thing that my heart requires is that you admire me.
Till then I'll see you hopefully through.
I do wish that you'd ask me to ride along.
It wouldn't be wrong to tell me more_than I know about you.
[Chorus]
How do I know why the sight of you makes me weak?
Each time I see you turn onto my street
Your hair is always up in a bun.
This girl is the one.
[Chorus]
Don't go.
I've_been down this road before
I walk out the door
Leave you on the floor
Sometimes you run and hide
Your foolish pride's
What keeps me from
Giving you more
So the best_thing I can give to you
Is for me to go
Leave you alone
Cause you got growin'_up to do
Someday I'll return when its time
For payment in kind
The church_bells will chime
You'll stand before me surrounded by lights
Dressed in white
You throw flowers in the air this night
But the best_thing I can give to you
Is for me to go
Leave you alone
You got growin'_up to do
Looks_like the rain's pouring down on me
It's drowning me now
And all I want is to come_back home
And this old corduroy coat is not keeping me dry
But I can't think of what else to try
That's why the best_thing I can give to you
Is for me to go
Leave you alone
You got growin'_up to do
Yeah, the best_thing I can give to you is for me to go
Leave you alone
You got growin'_up to do

당신을 위한 아름다운 길을 따라서
If we could sky rocket away
Up-up and away into the velvet skies
We'd leave all our troubles behind
Make faces at birds that pass by
It would be just you and I
And nobody_else to complicate this love
We'll wave at the world down below
And play tunes on our radio
And if on the way we get tired
We'll doze off amongst the clouds
And I'll catch you if you roll off
And hold you so you never fall
And if you allow me well make love amongst the stars
See the world from high up above
Oceans will look like ponds, people will look like crumbs
Fears will be miles apart~
If we could sky rocket away
Up-up and away into the clear blue_skies
We'll ride to the heavens above
And stop to give hugs to lost loves
And I'll be here for you indeed
As_long as you stay_here with me
I'll listen to your every thought
And hang onto your every_word
And if you allow me I'll_pick out the brightest star
Place it on your wedding_ring
And I pledge to keep you safe, shelter you from the rains
Guard you from monsters about
I come from a long line of pain
My family suffered greatly for my gain
And I think a lot about
How my daddy died
So I would not live_without
And his heart lives in my song
Where the melody comes
And just as quickly the melody is gone
I'm back alone, far_from home
Now my mamma's on her own
I try to call her and see her when I'm home
And after all that she's been through
All the doctors say: "There ain't nothing we can do"
And her heart lives in my song
Where the melody comes
And just as quickly the melody is gone
I'm back alone, far_from home
There's a bird outside my window
Takes the song where he goes
And he leaves it there
Like a dead man's rocking chair
And tonight I'm feeling lost and
Headin' down the highway out to Boston
I get the sense I might lose it
I thank_God tonight for the light I got in music
'Cause my heart lives in this song
Where the melody comes
And just as quickly, the melody is gone
I'm back alone, far_from home
"There lived a lady by the North Sea shore (Lay the bent to the bonnie broom) Two daughters were the babes she bore (Fa la_la la_la la_la la_la la) alternating with each of the lines below> As one grew bright as is the sun, So coal black grew the elder one. A knight came riding to the lady's door, He'd travelled far to be their wooer. He courted one with gloves and rings, But he loved the other above all things. Oh sister will you go with me To watch the ships sail on the sea? She took her sister by the hand And led her down to the North Sea strand. And as they stood on the windy shore The dark girl threw her sister o'er. Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam, Crying, ""Sister, reach to me your hand! ""Oh Sister, Sister, let me live, And all that's mine I'll surely give."" ""(It's) your own true love that I'll have and more, But thou shalt never come ashore."" And there she floated like a swan, The salt sea bore her body on. Two minstrels walked along the strand And saw the maiden float to land. They made a harp of her breastbone, Whose sound would melt a heart of stone. They took three locks of her yellow hair, And with them strung the harp so rare. They went into her father's hall To play the harp before them all, But when they laid it on a stone The harp began to play alone. The first string sang a doleful sound: ""The bride her younger sister drowned."" The second string as that they tried, In terror sits the black-haired bride. The third string sang beneath their bow, ""And surely now her tears will flow
"
I'm writing you letters
Tearing your pictures
saying goodbye
And I'm blowing a candle
trying to handle tonight
In la_la land la_la land
I'm in la_la la_la la_land
la_la land
So when the cheating is done
When you had all your fun
When I hate you
I'll be the one
I'll be there I will be there
I'll still be there
I'll still be in
La_la land la_la land
I'm dialing your number
Knowing you're with her
Just to say hi
It's hard hard to remember
We're not together
when you're mine
In la_la land la_la land
I'm in la_la la_la la_land
La_la land
So when the cheating is done
When you had all your fun
When they hate you
I'll be the one
And when the party ends
And you've lost all your friend
When they hate you call me again
Cause I'll be there
I will be there
I'll still be there
I'll still be in la_la land
la_la land
I'm in la_la la_la la_land
La_la land
I'm in la_la la_la la_la land
in la_la la_la la_la land
Home somewhere behind me
For miles that remind me
That nothing_stays the same
Scenes outside my window
Soft as a pillow
Where memories fall like rain
Maybe this road is taking
From where I was meant to be
Standing beside you
Making me smile through anything
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
So I turned around
You out in the distance
I'm skipping every exit to close
The space between
Oh
Maybe this road is taking
From where I was meant to be
Standing beside you
Making me smile through anything
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
So I turned around
I just can't get to you fast_enough
Wondering how I came this far
Without your love
Maybe this road is taking
From where I was meant to be
Standing beside you
Making me smile through anything
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
Oh I never knew
What was out there waiting
Directions are always changing
Alone in a crowd
So I turned around
Look_at me now we're on the town
Kicking up dust it's all for us
City_lights pretty lights
Just take me out to play
Dressing me up is red for luck
So much to do to hide the blue
City_lights pretty lights
Just wear me out they say
Buttons and ribbons
are finding their place
Smearing the makeup
I put on my face
Spiders and lizards
are tying my shoes
Whispering da_da da
Finding my crutch a gentle touch
Finding my dance retreat advance
City_lights pretty lights
Just ring me out to dry
Buttons and ribbons are
finding their place
Smearing the makeup
I put on my face
Spiders and lizards are
tying my shoes
Whispering da_da da
Sound straight from the twilight
Has me up all night
I can't fall_asleep
'cause I keep thinking of you
And I saw a shadow outside
my window and it's you.
All my sorrows flew away
Hush, keep quiet, hear me say
I don't ever want you to go
Please_stay
With the moonlight dancing free
And there's_no one but you and me
There's_no reason to go astray
Please_stay
Making up a story
It's the way you're looking at me
If you think that this is funny,
it's just you
Try and think_about it,
If you're heart is
closed don't lock,
Keep your keys
back in your pocket,
Think this through
All my sorrows flew away
Hush, keep quiet, hear me say
I don't ever want you to go
Please_stay
With the moonlight dancing free
And there's_no one but you and me
There's_no reason to go astray
Please_stay
Please_stay with me
Just stay with me
and I will take you to Foreverland
Just stay

"How would you know?
When everything around you's changing like the weather
A big black storm and where'd you turn to?
Or hide a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you let me know?
'Cause I don't want to trouble your mind with the childish
Design of how it all should go, but I love you so
When it all comes clear, when the wind is settled
I'll be here, you know
'Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sand upon that place
Darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your_face
Gracious_goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here and
Gracious_goes the ghost of you, my dear
How would you know?
When everything around you's bruised and battered
Like the cold night storm and where would you turn to?
Or hide a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you tell me so?
'Cause I, I adore you so when it all comes clear
The wind is settled, I'll be here, you know
'Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sand upon that place darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your_face
Gracious_goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here and
Gracious_goes the ghost of you, my dear
Gracious_goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here and
Gracious_goes the ghost of you, my dear

"I lie in your charms
Though it harms the best of me
And I lie on to my friends to them
No wonder why I wait for thee
And I hope like a child
Widow of the sea
I hold these arms_around you
All's around me
Will you be there when the day's_done
Will you be there
Under the same, under the same_sun
Under the same, under the same_sun
My yearn oughta turn these_things
Turn these_things around
I learned from you
Oh I made these plans, made these plans
With you around dear

Now he’s back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair hey_hey hey
Acts like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there’s time to change hey_hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June
hey_hey
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way
to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me did you fall for a shooting_star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
while you were looking_for yourself
out there
Now that he’s back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation hey_hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae bo
Reminds me that there’s room to grow hey_hey
Now that he's back
in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that
he might think of me as
plain ol' Jane
Told a story 'bout a man who was
too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep
you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance
along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were
looking_for yourself out there
Can you imagine no love
pride deep fried chicken
Your best_friend always
sticking up for you
even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance
five hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that
you ever had and me
Tell me did the wind sweep
you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance
along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me did you fall for a shooting_star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
while you were looking_for yourself
na_na na_na na_na na_na na_na
na_na na oh
na_na na_na na_na na_na na_na
na_na na oh
Can you imagine no love
pride deep fried chicken
Your best_friend always
sticking up for you
even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance
five hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that
you ever had and me
It's been so long since
I've met some one
That makes me feel this way
Makes me smile
and that's hard to do
I don't think
it's something you realize you do
You make me feel
Like I'm the only guy
With you in the world
But we can't be together
Can't really be friends
We can't be lovers
And we can't pretend
Oh that boy in your life
Better make you his wife
And he better believe
He's a lucky guy
You wanted a song
well here's one for you
Nobody will know except for us two
Don't ask me about it
Cuz I won't tell the truth
Just know that there's someone
Thinking of you
You make me feel
Something
I wish wasn't real at all
But we can't be together
Can't really be friends
We can't be lovers
And we can't pretend
Oh that boy in your life
Better make you his wife
And he better believe
He's a lucky guy
You were never mine to begin with
So we can't be together
Can't really be friends
We can't be lovers
And we can't pretend
Oh that boy in your life
Better make you his wife
And he better believe
he's a lucky guy
he's a lucky guy
The thing never now were you
You're gone and I won't see you anymore
You left my love on the run
And said that you were leaving
And you won't come home again
And you won't come home again
And I'll miss you like you're dead
But I never got to grieve you
Cause I saw you
In the arms of someone_else
So your phantom follows me
Like a child would his mother
Or a lover who never said goodbye
It's only saying goodbye
And I cry myself to sleep
And you thought I was happy
I was lonely
Had nowhere to go
And I heard that you moved on
Found a brand_new family
And changed your married name
And everything has_changed
And I'll miss you like you're dead
And find a way to grieve you
Cause I need to
Try and start again
And your ghost will have to leave
Like a child would his mother
Or a lover
Who has to say_goodbye
It's always say_goodbye
It's always say_goodbye
It's always say_goodbye
It's always say_goodbye
It's always say_goodbye
Pack your bags we’re leaving out of town
Wear that big black scarf wrapped around your pretty_face
I’m not gonna stand here hopelessly while I see you cry
Leave those mess we’ll jump in to the car
Roll the windows down get your senses back to you
And put out that cigarette that thing will kill you slowly
And yeah it only takes two hours from here
Yeah when we get there we’ll write our brand_new story
We’re going to a place I know where I was_born
The city of flowers been waiting so long
Life too_short you could’ve been shot
Remember this time leave your troubles behind
All your life you’ve waited for a time when that someone
To get your feet back on the ground
I’ll be that someone to help just like in that Beatles song
So here we go we’re going to a place
At the rainbows end to put some colors back on you
Let me be the gold and I will put the shine on you
And yeah we only have two exits to go
Yeah when we get there the pages will start turning
And all the lies you heard before keep coming back to you
They linger on the places you’ve longing to forget
Well I won’t lie it won’t be easy
Sometimes they’re back knocking on your door
Now you tell them that you don’t live here anymore
Want to but I can't_help it
I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even_if I did I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
and I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all_because of you And it's all_because of you
And it's all_because of you
And it's all_because
Never get_enough
She's the sweetest drug
Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away_from cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession wont_let me leave
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even_if I did I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
and I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all_because of you all_because of you
And it's all_because of you all_because of you
And it's all_because of you all_because of you
And it's all_because
Never get_enough
She's the sweetest drug
Ain't_no doubt so strung out
Ain't_no doubt so strung out
Over you over you over you
Because of you
And it's all_because of you
Never get_enough
She's the sweetest drug she's the sweetest dru
Well you done_done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but your so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks now I'm tryin to get back
before the cool done run out I'll be givin it my best test
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait
I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you're free
look into your heart and you'll_find love love love love
listen to the music of the moment
people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
loved loved loved loved loved
So i won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait i'm sure
there's_no need to complicate our time is short
this is our fate
I'm yours
I've_been spendin' way too long checkin'
my tongue in the mirror
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
and so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'd be sayin' is there_ain't no better reason
to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
it's what we aim to do
our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more
no more it cannot wait
I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you're free
look into your heart and
you will find that the sky is yours
so please don't please don't please don't
there's_no need to complicate
Cause our time is short
This this this is our fate
I'm yours
It used_to be so easy
to give my heart away
I found out the hard way
There's a price I have to pay
I found in that love's
no friend of mine
I should have known
better time after time
It_was so long so long_ago
But I've still got the
blues_for you
It used_to be so easy to
fall in love again
I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found in that love was
more_than just a game
I was playin' to win
But losin' just the same
It_was so long so long_ago
But I've still got the
blues_for you
So_many years since
I've_seen your_face
Here in my heart
there's an_empty space
Where you used_to be
Well it was so
long so long_ago
But I've still got the
blues_for you
Though the days come and go
There_is one_thing I know
I've still got the blues_for you
I see a black tree waving in the wind
While my heart whispers another sin
She has all you could want and more
But I couldn't have it
cause I'd probably lost it all
Coffee and beer
and a bottle of white wine and dine
Is all we need and a sip
of the everlasting_cigarette
The everlasting_cigarette
I'm a black hat with a dog
A soulhound covered in a
red wine dress
And your kiss it feels_like
rainbows on my lips
And the fate forms a fist
Coffee and beer
and a bottle of white wine and dine
Is all we need and a sip
of the everlasting_cigarette
The everlasting_cigarette
Coffee and beer
and a bottle of white wine and dine
Is all we need and a sip
of the everlasting_cigarette
The everlasting_cigarette
For in my way it lies
But I can't hear it cause I'm blind
Just help me out here and get closer
For in my way it lies
But I can't hear it cause I'm blind
Just help me out here and get closer
it's not a sigh
it's not a tear
it's over there and over here
it's like a kiss that flies away
tangled in cherry_blossom rain
you know my face
you know my heart
in little pieces torn apart
I let_them fall down the plane
they turn to cherry_blossom rain
cherry_blossom
cherry_blossom rain
cherry_blossom
cherry_blossom rain
and if there's one_thing I know
is that I don't know where to
land
with my two tiny paper wings
oh what is this thing
if it's not love
if it's not pain
it's just a cherry_blossom
a cherry_blossom
cherry_blossom rain
it's not a sigh it's not a tear
it's over there and over here
it's like a kiss that flies away
tangled in cherry_blossom rain
cherry_blossom
cherry_blossom rain
cherry_blossom
cherry_blossom rain
Your mouth is a revolver firing
bullets in the sky
Your love is like a soldier
loyal till you die
And I've_been looking at the
stars for a long long time
I've_been putting out fires all
my life
Everybody wants a flame but
they don't want to get burnt
And today is our turn
Days like these lead to
Nights like this leads to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my
bonfire heart
People like us we don't
need that much
Just someone that starts
starts the spark in our_bonfire hearts
This world is getting colder
Strangers passing by
No one offers you a shoulder No
one looks you in the eye
But I've_been looking at you
for a long long time
Just trying to break through
trying to make you mine
Everybody wants a flame they
don't want to get burnt
Well today is our turn
Days like these lead to
Nights like this leads to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my
bonfire heart
People like us we don't
need that much
Just someone that starts
starts the spark in our_bonfire hearts

Nights like this leads to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my
bonfire heart
People like us we don't
need that much
Just someone that starts
starts the spark in our_bonfire hearts
Will you say when I'm gone away
"My lover came to me and we'd lay"?
In rooms unfamiliar but until now,
oh-oh-oh-oh
Until now, oh-oh-oh-oh
Until now
Will you say to them when I'm gone
"I loved your son for his sturdy arms"?
We both learned to cradle
then live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without
Will you say when I'm gone away
"Your father's body was judgement day"?
We both dove and rose
to the riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside
Will you say to me when I'm gone
"Your face has faded but lingers on"?
'Cause light strikes a deal
with each coming night,_oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night,_oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night,_oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night,_oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night,_oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night,_oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night
Days go by like rain drop fall
I still feel the sting
City_lights don’t make this night
Any more bright
cuz I still hang to the
thought of me and you
So take your time and I’ll take mine
Maybe one day
we’ll meet up half way
Take your time and I’ll take mine
Yah I’ll take my time yah
Evenings pass like subway fares
Always I still cling
To what we had and what we felt
And though that you’re the one
who doubt this
Let me be your man I can
So take your time and I’ll take mine
Maybe one day
we’ll meet up half way
Take your time and I’ll take mine
Yah I’ll take my time yah
Baby I hope you take yours too
I know that
I’ll be waiting here for you
And even if you’re not here tonight
One_day we’re gonna get it right
So take your time and I’ll take mine
Maybe one day
we’ll meet up half way
Take your time and I’ll take mine
Yah I’ll take my time yah
So take your time and I’ll take mine
Maybe one day
we’ll meet up half way
Take your time and I’ll take mine
Yah I’ll take my time yah
Even_if i_apologise
I know
There's still a hill to climb
And i know
That i'll never quite convince you
Even_if i_apologise
I know
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all i have to give you
It's called a big mistake
It's called a bad choice made
Then comes the slippery slide
To no kiss goodbye
Even_if i_apologise
I know
I got a hill to climb
And i know
That i'll never quite convince you
Even_if i_apologise
I know
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all i have to give you
And every thought of her
Makes my regret grow worse
And i'd smash the whole thing down
If i could turn it round
Even_if i_apologise
I know
I got a hill to climb
And i know
That i'll never quite convince you
Even_if i_apologise
I know
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all i have to give you
So i'll just stand here broken
'cause i haven't had any sleep
And i'm forcing my eyes open
To see reality
And the colours that i'm made of
Are pouring out of me
But i can't run_away
From a big mistake
No i can't run_away
From a big mistake
Even_if i_apologise
I know
I got a hill to climb
And i know
That i'll never quite convince you
Even_if i_apologise
I know
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all i have to give you
far, you’re just so far
but why do I feel you
as though you’re sitting right next to me
but maybe I’m just trying to satisfy this compromise
and maybe while I play this guitar
you’ll show up in my view
telling me not to worry
then I wake_up and find my way back to reality
I hear the clock, it’s ticking
late at night it’s teasing me oooo
I can feel the pressure
seeping deep_inside of me
take it easy
go right ahead & don’t_forget to breathe
though it’s not all that perfect
it’s not always make it or break it
take it easy
go on ahead, don’t be afraid to feel
no, i don’t have all the answers
but as long_as we’re together
i’m GOnna take it easy
what have I become
am I still the same me
Is this the place where I want to be
Wherever I go I try to find a place
a home for my heart’s rhythm
hear the clock, it’s tickin’
late at night it’s callin’ me ooooh
I can see the future
that is where you’re taking me
take my time, enjoy the ride take it easy
we’ll be fine, all will align take it take it take it
You close the door
and start the motor
I roll the window down
I raise my hand and wave goodbye
To neighborhood queens
and clowns and
Children in the front yards
They hide and seek and laugh
I can almost hear you thinking
How could these_days go by so fast
And no rear_view could picture
What we leave behind
Drive_darling drive_darling
Drive_darling drive_darling
drive
A silent conversation
No words cause there's_no need
We let the tapes mix up the years
And press repeat and press repeat
The trunk is filled_with records
And books and tears and clothes
I'm smiling on the surface
I'm scared as hell below
And no rear_view could picture
What we leave behind
Drive_darling drive_darling
Drive_darling drive_darling
drive
Good morning freedom
Good_night lullabies
Drive_darling drive_darling
Drive_darling drive_darling
drive
And when we arrive
The hardest of goodbyes
You will dry my eyes
Somehow you're always by my side
The one who holds my kite
And watches over all my flights
Drive_darling drive_darling
Drive_darling drive_darling
drive
Good morning freedom
Good_night lullabies
Drive_darling drive_darling
Drive_darling drive_darling
drive
Drive_darling drive_darling
Drive_darling drive_darling
drive

All them boys are spraying down and shining their wheels, and all them girls are getting pretty putting on heels;
'Cause downtown there's a cover band warming up for the fever jam, blondes' in the bathroom washing x's off their hands
All of them party people stacking up in a line
Pushing up on each_other like it's raining outside
But I'ma stay right_here so we can disappear
Yeah I've_been waiting all night
Take me to the party girl in the same t_shirt
that you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that were spinning bare feet on the floor in the living_room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty Queen long legs and all
got me melting in the cushion of an_old love seat
Don't get much better_than you and me
And this party girl
I don't need all them humming, buzzing neon signs
Long_as you got that come and get me look in your eyes
Yeah I'ma stay right_here so we can disappear
We can do it up right
Take me to the party girl in the same t_shirt
that you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that were spinning bare feet on the floor in the living_room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty Queen long legs and all
got me melting in the cushion of an_old love seat
Don't get much better_than you and me
And this party girl
Take me to the party girl, wearing nothing but that t_shirt
Laying down on an_old love seat, nothing better_than you and me
And that party girl in the same t_shirt
that you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that were spinning bare feet on the floor in the living_room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty Queen long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an_old love seat
Don't get much better_than you and me
And this party girl
Ain't_nothing better_than you and me, girl
Yeah, so gimme that gimme that girl
I still believe in fairy_tales
I still believe in picking flowers
I still believe in getting lost
in someone’s eyes
And talking for hours
I still believe in shooting stars
I still believe in midnight drives
And butterflies you get
Right before you kiss
for the very_first time
Love how many_times
can a heart break
Love how_much weight
can a soul take
Love I don’t know
where you ran_off to
But love love love
I still believe in you
I still believe in miracles
I still believe in wedding rings
and bibles
I still believe the best walk
you’ll ever take
Is walking down the aisle
Love how many_times
can a heart break
Love how_much weight
can a soul take
Love I don’t know
where you ran_off to
But love love love
I still believe in you
Yeah I still believe in you
I still believe
that you’ll come knocking
on my door
When I least expect you to
You give me something I can hold
You pull me through
cuz that’s what you do
That’s_what you do love
Yeah_that’s what you do love
Love how many_times
can a heart break
Love how_much weight
can a soul take
Love I don’t know
where you ran_off to
But love love love
oh love love love
I still believe in you
I still believe in you
Yeah I still believe in you
When I close my eyes I hear you singing
Singing me a song that I'll forget
I always forget
I try to take myself back to sleeping
You pick me up but I let you down
It_was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay
Staystay
If only I could dream we could start again 2x
Ooohhh oooh
When I close my eyes I see you dancing
Dancing me a song
Just out of reach, just out of reach
I need you in a day when I'm not dreaming
You pick me up
I don't wanna let you down
It_was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay
Staystay
If only I could dream we could start again 2x
Ooohhh oooh
It_was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay
Staystaystay
If only I could dream we could start again
Stay
If only I could dream we could start again
Stay
If only I could dream we could start again 2x
Summer girl in the winter time
Your pretty eyes I pictured in the fading light
Little darling, little darling
You're mine
We walked for hours
Lost track of time
But I bought you flowers
So never let_them die, no, no
Little darling, little darling
You're mine
Little_darling
Little_darling
You're mine
You're far_away now
But you're on my mind
I'll never put a thing above you
You're my guiding light
Little darling, little darling
You're mine
Little_darling
Little_darling
You're mine
You'll never have to worry
And I'll tell you why
I'll never find a girl quite like you
I hope you realize
You're mine
You're mine
Little_darling
Little_darling
You're mine
On est encore rentré tard alcoolisé
On a noyé nos vie dans des verres teintés
De peurs bleues, de colères noires
Et l'on a ri, à n'en plus pouvoir
Les yeux mis-clos, les cheveux collés au front
Comme toutes ces pensées qui nous collent aux talons
Pourquoi ça fout l'cafard et les j'tons
De rester dans le noir, à compter les moutons..
[Refrain]
Et nos visages gris, quand le matin nous prend
En flagrant délit de perte de temps
Et nos regards hagards, lorsque la nuit s'endort
Et que le jour nous donne, tous les torts
[Couplet]
Qu'est-ce qui cloche chez moi ?
J'déconne à tours de bras
J'ai vomi ma haine sur vos regards
Paraît même qu' j'étais pas belle à voir
Qu'est-ce qui m'fout la trouille
Suffisamment pour qu'la nuit me dépouille
De ma raison, de tous mes sens
De ma maison, de mon essence
[Refrain]
Et nos visages gris quand le matin nous prend
En flagrant délit, de perte de temps
Et nos regards hagards, lorsque la nuit s'endort
Et que le jour nous donne, tous les torts
[Couplet]
C'est décidé cette fois j'arrête tout
J'me pose, j'me couche tôt, j'garde mes sous
Si j'ai un faible pour les alcools forts
Peut-être disparaît-il si je dors ?
J'arrête de disjoncter pour un oui pour un con
J'prends sur moi, j'échange mes talons aiguilles
Contre une vieille paire de baskets
J'aurai p't'être moins envie de faire la fête..
Mais j'm'ennuie, j'm'ennuie, j'm'ennuie..
Hmm... Mais j'm'ennuie...
I don't even mind if the angels come by
take my arms in their arms
draw me out above the neon wild where I
I dissolve, I dissolve
Reeling, my thoughts unwind
they trail off in a line
there's buzzards in my head where there once was a fire
and sparks and sparks and I
Let me lay down on your table
watch the sand fall, the trickle of time
won't you help me kill what ails
Come and kiss me pull the wool over my eyes
Feeling kinda tired by the window tonight
Heavy eyes, heavy eyes
sick of recollecting what has broken my stride
and I never mind, never mind
I tasted marrow, dirt on that halo
I woke_up in July to a dizzying light
the angels and wings and I
feathers and wings and I
San Diego, California
I don't remember, no, and I don't recall ya
complicated, anaesthetised
been awake for days and I don't know why
so let me lay down on your table
I'll watch the sand fall, the trickle of time
Won't you help me numb my mind
Come and kiss me pull the wool over my eyes
Tranquilize
I lie and think of evergreens
of winter voices and falling leaves
relax my palms and greet the night
a rush of heat as the needle finds
my bloodlines
my bloodlines
so never mind
I don't even mind if the angels come by, take my arms in their arms
there's buzzards in my head where there once was a fire
and sparks and sparks and sparks and sparks
and sparks and sparks and sparks and sparks
and sparks and sparks and sparks
Wherever you are
you know that I adore you
No_matter how far well
I can go before you
If ever you need someone
what not that you need help in
But if ever you want someone
you know that I am willing
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across an_angel
out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye
Wherever you go
I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
if it's a lot to swallow
If you just wanna be alone
I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
I am more_than willing
'Cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across some angel
out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across some angel
out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye
I've never been with anyone
in the way I've_been with you
But if love is not for fun
then it's doomed
'Cause water races
water races down
The waterfalls water races
water races down
The waterfalls
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came_across some angel
where there is no danger
Where love has eyes it is not blind
Long long way to the top
Long way down if you fall
And it's a long way back if you get lost
Long way out to the end
Long way to go to lose your friends
It's a long way to haul all the traps you've trawled
When you could just stop and let go
But you say
Not now,_maybe later
But not now,_maybe later
Not now,_maybe later
You're only in your way
But not now,_maybe later
You're only in your way
Not now,_maybe later
You're only in your way
But not now,_maybe later
You're only in your way
But not now,_maybe wait
You're only in your way
'Cause love is tough
When enough is not enough
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
I’ll see you
on the other_side
Our broken_hearts
riding the highest tides
And our love will sing
to the goodnight moon
I’ll say_goodbye
The sweetest one I ever knew
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll be seeing you
Late night rides and alley ways
Cigarettes
late night talks and ashtrays
Broken records out of tune
You look deeply in my eyes
You were a dream
that I got so lost inside
I’ll see you
on the other_side
Our broken_hearts
riding the highest tides
And our love will sing
to the goodnight moon
I’ll say_goodbye
The sweetest one I ever knew
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll surely miss
you walkin’ up to my door
Greeted with that
beautiful smile that I’ll miss
Could only think of
kissing your_face once more
I’ll miss the first_time
you said hello
But now they’re memories
that I can’t let go
Pieces of you that I’ll hold
I’ll see you
on the other_side
Our broken_hearts
riding the highest tides
And our love will sing
to the goodnight moon
I’ll say_goodbye
The sweetest one I ever knew
I’ll be seeing you
I’ll be seeing you
Baby blue staring in the window_pane
Just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she's got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress
Now her heart's a mess
Praying she will find a way to make it
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
Searching for a sign in the night even like a lonely string of lights
That'll burn just long_enough for you to see it
The road's been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There's more to this than just the breath you're breathing
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
On the way down
You won't forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath and fly
Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
Oh oh,_oh oh
Fly
Fly
I had a dream that someone came
to find me again
Wonder if you're the old ship
that landed here
The howling night will pass by
Oh we'll steal the verse
Calling on shadows
And calling on shadows
Be there
Oh let us stay
don't let our small dresses
get rose
We move in circles of light
Carry your shape
in the light of the cold
Let us return to the edge
of the storm
Give us a way to bring
all our bodies home
Let us return to the edge
of the light
In circles
When I call you up
Can I call you love
I won’t keep in touch
That’s_what I’m_afraid of
Isn’t this some_shit
Let’s call it what it is
I can’t be your bitch
That’s_what I’m_afraid of
Waiting_here since_Sunday but you never say the word_(stay)
Leaving_here for London_but I’ll see you on the first_(hey)

10 PM, most folks are sleeping
But it's the weekend
So we ain't, and we know where the cows don't go
These 40 inch tires saving up pavement
So we're taking them on red dirt place somewhere offroad
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle_of the night in the middle_of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Round here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on_fire, on_fire, on fire
Setting the night on_fire, on_fire, on fire
Girls showing up late as always
Now it's a party
Cut off sun dresses, they're ready to go
Don't need no dance road tonight
Just country music and good_times
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle_of the night in the middle_of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up

On fire

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering
around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling
with my folks I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street

Reindeer's flying
through the sky so high
I should be making a list I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you under the mistletoe
With you shawty_with you
With you shawty_with you

The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ay love don't you buy me nothing
Cause I am feeling one_thing

That’s a merry merry Christmas
It’s the most_beautiful time

I beg your pardon, mama, what did you say
My mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay
It's not that I'm not interested, you see
Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be
I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove
Keep on talking, mama, I can hear
Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear
I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove
Voila An American Dream
Well, we can travel girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign
Just keep talking, mama, I like that sound
It goes so easy with that rain falling down
I think a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear
Voila An American Dream
Yeah, we can travel, girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign
Just think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove
Why me Lord what have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
Tell me, Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth lovin' you or the kindness you've shown
Lord help me, Jesus, I've_wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
But now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand
Try me, Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay all I've taken from you
Maybe Lord I can show someone_else
What I've_been through myself, on my way back to you
Lord help me, Jesus, I've_wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
But now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand
Lord help me, Jesus, I've_wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
But now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus my souls in your hand
Jesus, my soul's in your hand
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds_of magic;_it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds_of magic;_it's hard to believe
[Verse_1]
Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows
[Pre-Chorus]
These_are real things
These_are real things
[Chorus]
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds_of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank_God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
[Verse_2]
Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't_matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel
[Pre-Chorus]
And these are real things
Yeah, these are real things
[Chorus]
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds_of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank_God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you
[Pre-Chorus]
These_are real things
These_are real things
[Chorus 2]
Oh, what a world, all kinds_of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
[Outro]
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds_of magic;_it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds_of magic;_it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds_of magic;_it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds_of magic;_it's hard to believe
You look out the window while I look_at you
Saying "I don't know"
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore
[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there_ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy
[Verse_2]
After the gold rush, there_ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run_away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there_ain't room for both of us in this town
[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't_no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space
[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't_no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy
I couldn't help
but notice you were sitting
by yourself
Dropping limes in a Corona
like you're trying to get
over somebody_else
It's funny_how your story
sounds a little like mine
Oh cause' I've_been at a table
with a bottle peeling labels
to pass the time
We can be blue as a neon_light
Singing them sad up
songs all night
We can say_goodbye just head home
But if we're_going to be alone
We should be alone_together
Kissing over there in the corner
where nobody_else can see
Keeping each_other company
We should be alone_together
Leaning up
against my car door parked
outside on the street
where it's just you and me
We should be alone_together
I couldn't help but notice
you could_use another drink
Yeah I don't wanna leave ya
And it's two for one Tequila
so what you think
We can be blue as a neon_light
Singing them sad up
songs all night
We can say_goodbye just head home
But if we're_going to be alone
We should be alone_together
Kissing over there in the corner
where nobody_else can see
Keeping each_other company
We should be alone_together
Leaning up
against my car door parked
outside on the street
where it's just you and me
We should be alone_together
We should be alone_together
We should be alone_together
oh yeah
We should be alone_together
Over there in the corner
where nobody_else can see
We should be alone_together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody_else can see
Keeping each_other company
We should be alone_together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone_together
We should be alone_together
We should be alone_together
oh yeah
We should be alone_together
Seventeen
you don't think
that much about life
You just live it
Like Kerosene dancing
around a fire
But you're in it
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all
She got the best of me
She_broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something
new worth living for
And a old dusty hand-me-down
six string
And a_couple chords
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing a-long
She got the best of me
She_broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She_broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
Sitting on the back
of a crowded train
Count raindrops falling
on the window_pane
Had the worst damn longest
craziest day today
Only one way I know
to get out of this place
Don't need no car or a ticket
or a plane
Just close my eyes
let the music carry me away
And I put my headphones on
Turn the real world off
And I get lost in the middle
of a country_song
And they're singing 'bout the guy
with the blue ripped jeans
And he's standing right there
in front_of me
And they're singing
'bout a small_town Saturday_night
Dancing in the dirt glitter in the sky
I had my first real kiss all over again
And he's spinning me around
in my little red_dress
All I gotta do is put these
headphones on
And I'm lost in the middle
of a country_song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Had somebody pick me
up and drop me off
Had a boombox party
in a parking lot
Or a beach fire
all night sing_along I'm gone
When I put my headphones on
Turn the real world off
And I get lost in the middle
of a country_song
And they're singing 'bout the guy
with the blue ripped jeans
And he's standing right there
in front_of me
And they're singing
'bout a small_town Saturday_night
Dancing in the dirt glitter in the sky
I had my first real kiss all over again
And he's spinning me around
in my little red_dress
All I gotta do is put
these headphones on
And I'm lost in the middle
of a country_song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Lost
in the middle_of a country_song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sitting on the back
of a crowded train
Count raindrops falling
on the window_pane
Had the worst damn longest
craziest day today
Then I hear them singing
'bout the guy with
the blue ripped jeans
And he's standing right
there in front_of me
And they're singing
'bout a small_town Saturday_night
Dancing in the dirt glitter in the sky
I had my first real kiss all over again
And he's spinning me
around in my little red_dress
All I gotta do is
put these headphones on
And I'm lost in the middle
of a country_song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh can't stop
singing_along singing_along
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh can't stop
singing_along singing_along
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost in the middle_of a country_song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh can't stop

Too_many people in this bar
I can't hear myself think over the guitar
I can tell that you wanna get out of here and disappear, don't ya, baby
Too_many lights on in the street
I can see the way that you're looking at me
And the way you're slipping off your Jimmy Choo's, like you wanted to since we got here
Now, we're driving down the highway, pulling into my place
Got your hand over my knee
Now that we're alone
I'm gonna let you know everything you mean to me
Chorus
There's_no such_thing as too_much money
'Cause if I had it all I would spend it on you, honey
Time on your hands baby I can take it off ya, let me take it off ya
'Cause I'm love drunk
Sipping on your kiss a little too much, and I can't get_enough
Like too_much shine in a diamond ring, there's_no such_thing
There_ain't no_such thing
There_ain't no_such thing
There_ain't no_such thing, yeah
Verse_2
And just in case you didn't know

You know it drives me crazy, don't ya, baby

'Cause if I had it all I would spend it on you, honey
Time on your hands, baby, I can take it off ya, let me take it off ya

The angel Moroni asleep in the carport
With the newspaper under his arm
It_seems I was late to deliver his car_keys
So it looks like we are staying behind
Was Lucifer bashful in hiding his face from the Lord
Dear Jesus, forgive me, I am only doing as I was told
For as it is written, I will soon one day face my own fire
And this world will go with me, if I can just get them all on my side
Carry me over_rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over_rainbows and Rainier
I was late to the parlor
When the wind it blew forward
And demanded we get out of town
So me and Moroni took the keys to the steeple
And awaited Armageddon to go down
Place your queens on the table
Who are weeping for your daughters
Who are waiting_for their someday to return
Every heart will be broken
Prophetic poems spoken
From the mouths of every baby to be born
Carry me over_rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over_rainbows and Rainier
Let your cries be of joy
May it always and forever fill the void
And allow my heart some room
May it be so that you'll one day need me soon
With my wheels in a turning
And my back to the window
I collected every_wave from the shore
I forgot I was human as I laid up my emotions
And I knocked them like dishes to the floor
Carry me over_rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over_rainbows and Rainier
It_doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
It's bigger_than the rest_of us
he'll promise you that
I'm glad I'm glad
He's picking up the drinks
and then he's knocking them back
I've never seen someone
who wears a sad little
mask like that
like that
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his_hand
Is_busy today with
someone_else's plans
He_chooses life and then
she_chooses a man
It_doesn't really matter
if I'm happy or sad
In any case I look_at him
my life ain't half as bad as bad
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his_hand
Is_busy today with
someone_else's plans
He_chooses life and then
she_chooses a man
He's picking it up
but she don't give a damn
Hold me it's a crisis that
we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting
an American war
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away
Hold me it's a crisis that
we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting
an American war
The only guy that has got you
in the palm of his_hand
Is_busy today with
someone_else's plans
He_chooses life and then
she_chooses a man
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe there's a fire_today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away
Oh my lonely heart
she could hang around for days
Will never leave the house
something more_than just a phase
She'd eat occasionally
just like she would
when she’s alone
She'll play the game for free
until she dies until she dies
She_howls she_dances
She_howls as she_does
She_howls as she_dances
She_howls as she_does
Just like a wolf
And as she reads aloud
ankles hanging off the bed
She'll read to nobody
or was it something that she said
She is like the trees the sun
that creeps through my window
She_knows her body
the kind that turns you into gold
She_howls as she_dances
She_howls as she_does
She_howls as she_dances
She_howls as she_does
Just like a wolf
And I’m jealous of her feet
The way she runs from nobody
The way she walks right
through the sea
And how she'll make you weep
Oh my lonely heart
she could hang around for days
Will never leave the house
something more_than just a phase
She'd eat occasionally
just as she likes
She'll play the game for free
until she dies until she dies
Mmm mmm_mmm
Mmm mmm_mmm
Mmm mmm_mmm
Mmm mmm_mmm mmm_mmm
Well will you fill my head with stories
'Til I close my eyes and dream
until the dawn
And when I'm sleeping
tell me secrets
Tell me things
you've never told no_one before
And when you wake_up
hiding nothing
Maybe you'll know
how it feels to be born
I could wake_up feeling something
for the first_time in so long
And we could walk down
towards the sea
In the new shoes I bought you
Stay there for all of the day
While the sun plays on the water
Well will you fill me with excitement
Like the feeling that
we felt on Christmas Eve
When we didn't know to laugh
or to cry in to our sleeves
And I know some things are not real
But in you I truly feel I believe
When we lie down on your bed
I press my head down on your chest
and hear you breathe
Well I know it's late
but let's go to the sea
I know a way that is shorter
And we could sink out under the stars
You can wear my woolen jumper
And we can sink out in to the stones
you can lay upon my shoulder
And we could stay
there all of the night
While the moon rests on the water
While the moon rests on the water
While the moon rests on the water
Yeah I used_to be the guy that talked about the guy
I've_been turnin' into, ever since I met you
But I ain't gonna lie, kinda like this table for two
With you
Yeah, I was driftin' round from town to town
Wasn't ever gonna settle for the settlin' down
But you turned that around, saw a side of me I never knew
Yeah, it's true
Chorus
Before I knew_it, I was holdin' all the doors, holdin' your hand
Gettin' off of work just as_fast as I can
Callin' you up, askin' what you're_doin'
Girl, before I knew it
Before I knew_it, I was spendin' my time, spendin' my paycheck
All around you, girl, I gotta say, this
Whole love thing, I thought_I'd never do it
But that's before I knew_it, that's before I knew it
Verse_2
Now, I ain't missing those lonely nights
I found myself another keepin' kind
Blonde hair, blue eyes, out of the blue
I never saw it comin'
Chorus
Before I knew_it, I was holdin' all the doors, holdin' your hand
Gettin' off of work just as_fast as I can
Callin' you up, askin' what you're_doin'
Girl, before I knew it
Before I knew_it, I was spendin' my time, spendin' my paycheck
All around you, girl I gotta say, this
Whole love thing, I thought_I'd never do it
But that's before I knew_it, that's before I knew it
Bridge
Before I knew I was talkin'_'bout a ring
Talkin' 'bout a house
Thinkin' 'bout things that I never thought about
Who would have knew it
Chorus
Before I knew_it, I was holdin' all the doors, holdin' your hand
Gettin' off of work just as_fast as I can
Callin' you up, askin' what you're_doin'
Girl, before I knew it
Before I knew_it, I was spendin' my time, spendin' my paycheck
All around you, girl, I gotta say, this
Whole love thing, I thought_I'd never do it
But that's before I knew_it, that's before I knew it
Outro
Before I knew it
Oh, this old love thing
Before I knew it
Don't go resting your eyes
It's not time to dream yet
Don't you leave us behind
There_is so_much you'd regret
But I feel so far_away
When your night is my morning in LA
Bad news makes it before I can wake
When your night is my morning in LA
Don't go resting your eyes
It's not time it's not time to dream yet
There's a mountain to climb
Take it one step at a time
But I feel so far_away
When your night is my morning in LA
Bad news makes it before I can wake
When your night is my morning in LA
When your night is my morning in LA
For all the times
I get watch you
checkin' your shades
in that side view mirror
For all the times
I get wake_up next to you
tangled_up in my sheets
For every walk on the boulevard
with you on my arm
every head turning like
Who's that girl
You'd think I'd get tired
of it eventually
But forever ain't long_enough
For the fire that
I have in my heart for you
No there_ain't enough ticks
on the clock
To do all of the things that
I wanna do with you
I never wanna stop
Tastin' heaven on your_lips
when you're kissi'g me
Baby even if I had an eternity
To give you all of my love yeah
Forever_ain't long_enough
Oh forever ain't long_enough
Now baby I can't apologize
for keepin' you up
a little late past midnight
Sleep is way overrated in comparison
to starin' in your baby blues
Every sunset view Wanna drag it out
It always ends too_soon My love
Forever_ain't long_enough
For the fire that
I have in my heart for you
No there_ain't enough
ticks on the clock
To do all of the things that
I wanna do with you
I never wanna stop
Tastin' heaven on your_lips
when you're kissin' me
Baby even if I had an eternity
To give you all of my love yeah
Forever_ain't long_enough yeah
Forever_ain't
Forever_ain't
Forever_ain't
Forever_ain't
Forever_ain't
Forever_ain't
Oh forever ain't long_enough
For the fire that
I have in my heart for you
No there_ain't enough ticks
on the clock
To do all of the things that
I wanna do with you
I never wanna stop
Tastin' heaven on your_lips
when you're kissin' me
Baby even if I had an eternity
To give you all of my love yeah
Forever_ain't long_enough
Oh forever ain't long_enough
Forever_ain't long_enough
Will I see you tonight
Been waiting my whole_life
I’ve_had this dream inside
Of looking in your eyes
In this far_away place
Where just saying your name
Gets me drunk on distance
& every night feels the same
Now I’m longing for the word
The one I’ve never known
A vast solstice of flowers
That are all rightfully yours
& I love you the way
I want everyone to know
How very much I love them
But never told them so
Your soul is where the light
Goes begging door to door
Goes begging door to door
I woke_up with you on my mind
Watched the air turn as you breathe
Yellow morning filling up your eyes
Waking up the life in me
You set my soul on fire
You pull my heartbeat towards the sun
You give me new eyes open
You call my heartbeat into love
There’s a quiet moving in your ways
It’s a peace I’ve never known
Build my anchor throw it in your waves
Slow it down and call you home
You set my soul on fire
You pull my heartbeat towards the sun
You give me new eyes open
You call my heartbeat into love
You set my soul on fire
You pull my heartbeat towards the sun
You give me new eyes open
You call my heartbeat into love
Destiny made her way and found you in a room
They told me, they told me
To undo the rule of mind and body
Nature laughed away as their voices grew
They told me, they told me
Clean out the room and bury the body
Chorus
But I know you with a heartbeat
So how does the night feel
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
But now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
But now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
Verse_2
I haven't walked for days though I wanted to
You told me, you told me
For with every move the feeling follows
In nature's empty face, I am of little use
You told me, you told me
I'm just another fool for the earth to swallow
Bridge
But the road through most will lead you back
And I will be with you
For the road of your mind will eat you up
On your island of doom
Where the voices all have gathered up
To a choir of fools
But I know my mind will reach you there
And I will be with you
Chorus
Oh, I know you with a heartbeat
So how does the night feel
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
And now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
And now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
Ooh, why'd you wake me up today
Ooh, why'd you wake me up today
Ooh, when the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
Ooh, when the lights_fade out
When the lights_fade out
Ooh, when the lights_fade out
Outro
Mm

They_say It's alright
They_say It's alright
Say It's alright

Oh when the lights are low
'Cause when you move it slow

'Cause it's alright whoa

Now listen to the beat
Kinda tap your feet
'Cause you got soul
Everybody_knows that it's alright
Whoa it's alright
When you wake_up
early in the mornin'
Feelin' sad like so_many of us do
Hold a little soul
And make life your goal
And surely something's

And you gotta say It's alright
And say It's alright
Say It's alright

Someday I'll find me a woman

Where my road has got to go
My love she will know
From mornin' noon until the night
And she's gotta say
that it's alright
And say It's alright
Say It's alright
have a good time
'Cause it's alright whoa

'Cause you got soul
Everybody_knows that it's alright
Whoa it's alright
It's all on me it's my mistake
I said I don't love you
a little too_late
But I guess there_ain't
ever a right time
And I don't know
why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the
door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better
I hope you find
what you were looking_for
I hope your heart
ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on
all figured_out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now
Who knew this heart
could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall_apart
Without so_much as a warning
I thought that I was
what you wanted
Well I guess you found
what you were looking_for
I guess my heart ain't
worth it anymore
I'm a wreck I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing_left
And so I hope you're happy now
I hope you find what
you were looking_for
I guess my heart
ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on
all figured_out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing_left
So I hope you're happy now
Happy now
Oh I hope you're happy now
Someday I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew_up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframe
I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a_bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted
And when I grow_up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies
I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake_up before we do it
I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No, I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted
On the day that I left you
In sweet Monterrey
I realized something
You'll never be far_away
I'll be thinking_about you all my days
I'll be thinking_about you all the way
And I don't know when you got in my head
But I'm not going to let you fade
Give me your eyes baby
Give me your heart too
Give me your affection now
Give me all of you
I'll be thinking_about you all my days
I'll be thinking_about you all the way
And I'm not sure how, but you're in me now
And I know that you're there to stay
And your loving makes me lose my place
I can not get_enough of your_face
The way you come to me in the night
I just want to hold you tight
I'll be thinking_about you all my days
I'll be thinking_about you all my days
I'll be thinking_about you all my days
I'll be thinking_about you
Woke up cold the smell of smoke & ash
Of fires bright and burned away
Your notes still ringing in my ears I guess
A choir louder every day
[Pre-Chorus]
All my words are caught beneath my tongue
All my lines still hid somewhere deep in my lungs and
[Chorus]
Oh my chest says it's not over just yet
Oh my mind guesses it's not clear ask again
Both my feet seem to wanna lead straight to your door
But oh my eyes see you're not here anymore
[Verse_2]
I've_been waiting on your hearts arrest
After all those wanted signs
Plastered everywhere I go, confess
The breath you broke in and stole was mine
[Pre-Chorus]
All my words are caught beneath my tongue
All my lines still hid somewhere deep in my lungs and
[Chorus]
Oh my chest says it's not over just yet
Oh my mind guesses it's not clear ask again
Both my feet seem to wanna lead straight to your door
But oh my eyes see you're not here anymore
[Bridge]
And no_one wants to leave
With broken bones but we
Can't_help but fall sometimes
[Chorus]
Oh my chest says it's not over just yet
Oh my mind guesses it's not clear ask again
Both my feet seem to wanna lead straight to your door
But oh my eyes see you're not here anymore
You're not here anymore
You're not here anymore
Verse_1
Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting_for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing
Verse_2
Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing
Verse 3
It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
Verse 4
We'll_meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
Are you the brutal heart?
Are you the brutal heart
that I've_been lookin' for?
'Cause if you're lookin' for love,
you can look for that door
Hearts
Hearts that break the night in two
And arms that can hold you,
that's true
So use me
So use me
I don't mind at all
I don't mind that you only call me
when you want
And I'm just glad you want me at all
And hearts
Hearts that break the night in two
And arms that can hold you,
that's true
So use me
So use me
Are we brutal hearts?
Are we brutal hearts
that break the night in two?
'Cause I just want this night with you
I don't like the man
(No, I don't likе the man)
I don't like the man
that I am (You arе)
'Cause I just want this night with you
So let's take this night
from black to blue
So let's take this night
from black to blue
So use me
So use me
(Hey)
Use me
Use me
You're a needle in a haystack
You're so damn hard to find
Candy apple red Cadillac
You're one of a kind
He let you go like a dandelion
And you blew out with the breeze
If I ever get a hold of you
I'd never let you leave
I'd make sure your stars are_shining
Sure_as the Frio's winding
I'd bottle you up like lightning
I'd rope the moon for you
A_million times
That's what I'd do
If you were mine
I'd drink you down like fine wine
'Til there was nothing_left
Boy, it should be criminal
The way you steal my breath
I'd make sure your stars are_shining
Sure_as the Frio's winding
I'd bottle you up like lightning
I'd rope the moon for you
A_million times
That's what I'd do
If you were mine
I'd memorize you like a scripture
Hang on every word, ooh
I'd make you my whole_world
Boy, if I was her
Girl, for what it's worth
I'd make sure your stars were shining
I'd make sure your stars are_shining
Sure_as the Frio is winding
Sure_as the Frio is winding
I'd bottle you up like lightning
Lightning
I'd rope the moon for you
For you
A_million times
That's what I'd do
If you were mine
Ooh, if you were mine
Ooh-ooh, you were mine
Mmm, if you were mine
You were mine
If you were mine
All mine, mine, mm
I shouldn't look for someone like you
Who daydreams too_much about wasting their youth
And I shouldn't care, and I shouldn't care, but I do
And I shouldn't stay up until 2_AM
Hopelessly wondering what I can mend
And I shouldn't care, and I shouldn't stare, but I do
And if only I was somebody you wanted
Just for the day, but you wanted
Someone you know that wouldn't leave
I know that's never been me
Strange how you don't know just how I think
'Cause I read your mind like it's written with ink
Scribbles and mess, but lines that still play with my heart
And if only I was somebody you wanted
Just for the day, but you wanted
Someone you know that wouldn't leave
I know it's not what you need
I wrote your name seventeen times
Just to figure_out when, figure_out why
And it's starting again, it's strange, I don't know
Why you would stay if you knew you would go
And you called out to me, desperately weak
With something to say, if you only could speak
And I tried to pretend, I just can't deny
That I'd lie just for you if you passed me tonight
If only I was somebody you wanted
Just for the day, but you wanted
Someone you know that wouldn't leave
I know that'd never be me
I know that'd never be me
Alright man I’m ready when y’all are
This_is your song mike let’s do it
Here we go, 1, 2, 3, eh
So take me down a road thats a little_bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced_tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
Hey driver, pull on over I’m in a fight with god
This Carolina shoulder seems the place I’m getting off
Daddy always told me, never make a home on the road
While your lady’s sneaking out and the kids are growing old
Hey driver, I’ve_been riding this lonely way too long
All the love I have worth giving is all spent on my songs
Hey driver, the boys are gambling with more_than just their cards
With their bottles and their drugs and their bibles and their hearts
So take me down a road thats a little_bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced_tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
Hey driver, I’ve_been feeling like there’s no point at all
The klonopin ain’t kicked in and I missed my sisters call
Hey_driver I’m so tired_of the ways of this old world
Just drive until the tires melt we’ll come_back when it’s healed
So take me down a road thats a little_bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced_tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
So take me down a road thats a little_bit windy
To a place they still put sugar in their iced_tea
Where the women are fine and the love is fair
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
Hey_driver you can drop me off_anywhere
It won’t let you down easy
It’ll let you down with lead weights pulling either side
And as you fall under
You’ll be fighting for breath with all you've_got
As you fall & you flounder
Calling for help won’t help you none
You sink into the song
Like a fire drowning in a setting sun
You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over all of this”
If I should, call your name
Would you hear me out at all?
If I should, call your name
Would you hear me out at all?
As the waves turn to thunder
You look for a rock that could hold you up
And as you get close
You realise that you’re all that rock has got
You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what Loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you - ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over all of this”
You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what Loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you - ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over all of this”
And it is what it is
Love taught me what Loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you - ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say “I thought that I was over this shit
But I’m not”
The city feels clean this time of
night just empty streets
And me walking home to clear my head
I know it came as no surprise
I'm affected more_than I had guessed
on what was said
If the smile's_not meant to be,
if the heart's_not ready to open
If we make it I won't see it's broken
If the smile's_not meant to be,
if the heart's_not ready to open
If we make it I won't see how it's broken
It's the quiet time before the dawn
and I'm half past making sense of it,
was I wrong?
Should I claim to give it all ?
in a world where not much
ever seems to last long
If the smile's_not meant to be,
if the heart's_not ready to open
If we make it I won't see it's broken
if the smile's_not meant to be
If the heart's_not ready to open
if we make it I won't
See how it's broken
How it's broken
How it's broken
How it's broken
If the smile's_not meant to be
If the heart's_not ready to open
If we make it I won't see it's broken
If the smile's_not meant to be,
if the heart's_not ready to open
If we make it I won't see how it's broken
How it's broken
How it's broken
If I imagine myself peaceful
On the fire escape
Head first, my hands inside my
T-shirt, as we run_away
So now we have a running start
My body moves in mystic ways
I cross my arms to shield my heart
As everything turns into waves
I see the light upon the lake
The silver moon, the water snake
A_pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish
If I align myself with Pisces
In a funny way
Can you, my lover, kiss my bracelet
And my shoulder blades
We’ve always had a running start
I jump between the trampolines
You throw your arms_around my heart
As if to say you’re all I need
The winter pines, the lonely drake
The light beneath the frozen lake
A_pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don’t go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last_night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk_about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said
Stay,_stay, stay
I've_been loving you for quite_some time, time, time
You think that it's_funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we_both stay
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to
Stay,_stay, stay
I've_been loving you for quite_some time, time, time
You think that it's_funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we_both stay, stay, stay,_stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those_times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole_life
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite_some time
No one_else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we_both stay,_stay
Stay,_stay, stay, stay!
Stay,_stay, stay
I've_been loving you for quite_some time, time, time
You think that it's_funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we_both stay,_stay
Stay,_stay, stay, stay!
Stay,_stay, stay
I've_been loving you for quite_some time, time, time
You think that it's_funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we_both stay
(ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)
I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It_was the best night, never would forget how we_moved
The_whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like_we're made of starlight
Like_we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It_was the best night, never would forget how we_moved
The_whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like_we're made of starlight,_starlight
Like_we're made of starlight,_starlight
He_said, "Look at you
Worrying so_much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole_life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream_impossible things?"
Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It_was the best night, never would forget how we_moved
The_whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like_we're made of starlight,_starlight
Like_we're made of starlight,_starlight
Ooh,_ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh,_ooh, dancing with me
Ooh,_ooh, we could get_married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
Oh, my, what a marvelous_tune
It_was the best night, never would forget how we_moved
The_whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like_we're made of starlight,_starlight
Like_we're made of starlight,_starlight
Like_we're made of starlight,_starlight
Like we dream_impossible dreams
Like starlight,_starlight
Like we dream_impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream_impossible things?
Took a deep_breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little_kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've_been spending the last_eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin_again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little_kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've_been spending the last_eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin_again
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every_single Christmas, and I will talk_about that
And for the first time, what's past is past
'Cause you threw your head back laughing like a little_kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've_been spending the last_eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin_again
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin_again
You said it in a simple way
4AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One_last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster_than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling_sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come_back, be here, come_back, be here
I guess you're in New_York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come_back, be here, come_back, be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so_much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't_help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling_sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come_back, be here, come_back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come_back, be here, come_back, be here
This_is falling in love in the cruelest way
This_is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
This_is when the feeling_sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come, back be here, come_back, be here
I guess you're in New_York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come_back, be here, come_back, be here
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come_back, be here
Come_back, be here
Loving_him is like
Driving a new_Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving_him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all
Losing_him was blue like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving_him was red
Loving_him was red
Touching him_was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front_of you
Memorizing him_was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite_song
Fighting with him_was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's_no right answer
Regretting him_was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing_him was blue like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving_him was red
Oh, red
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning_red
Burning, it was red
Losing_him was blue like I'd never known
Missing_him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting_him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving_him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning_red
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning_red
His love was like
Driving a new_Maserati down a dead end street
Help the poor

Need all the loving

Help the poor

For your love don't you realize
I need help

To pull me through

I am on a lonely road
and i am traveling
Traveling traveling traveling
Looking_for something
what can it be
Oh i hate you some
i hate you some
I love you some
Oh i love you
when i forget_about me
I want to be strong
i want to laugh along
I want to belong to the living
Alive alive
i want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings
in some juke box dive
Do you want
do you want
do you want
To dance with me baby
Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding
some sweet romance
with me baby
Well come on
All i really really want
our love to do
Is to bring out the best
in me and in you too
All i really really want
our love to do
Is to bring out the best
in me and in you
I want to talk to you

I want to renew you
again and again
Applause applause
life is our cause
When i think of your kisses
My mind see saws
Do you see

do you see
How you hurt me baby
So i hurt you too
Then we_both get so blue
I am on a lonely road
and i am traveling
Looking_for the key
to set me free
Oh the jealousy
the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy
that could be
I want to have fun
i want to shine like the sun
I want to be the one
that you want to see
I want to knit you a sweater
Want to write you a love letter
I want to make you feel better
I want to make you feel free
Want to make you feel free
I want to make you feel free
My old_man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece_of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old_man
Keeping away my blues
He's my sunshine
in the morning
He's my fireworks
at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord
I ever heard
Play that warm chord
play and stay baby
We don't need no piece_of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old_man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece_of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No my old_man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
My old_man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece_of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No my old_man
Keeping away my lonesome blues
Look_out the left
the captain said
The lights down there
that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the las vegas sands
It_wasn't the one
that you gave to me
That night down south
between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors
Oh starbright starbright
You've_got the lovin' that i like
all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on
this flight tonight
You got the touch
so gentle and sweet
But you've_got
that look so critical
Now i can't talk to you baby
I get so weak
Sometimes i think
love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven
Down there's a town
Blackness everywhere
and little lights shine
Oh blackness
blackness dragging me down
Come on light the candle
in this poor heart of mine
Oh starbright starbright
You've_got the lovin' that i like
all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't hove got on
this flight tonight
I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing goodbye baby
baby goodbye
Ooh_ooh love is blind
Up go the flaps
down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat
turned on baby
I hope they finally fixed
your automobile
I hope it's better
when we meet again baby
Starbright starbright
You got the lovin' that i like
all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on
this flight tonight
Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me it's plain
I should have known I'd never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Why can't I forget the past
Start loving someone_new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You had hope in the morning
So much hope in the morning
And who wouldn’t want a good, good life?
All us felons want a better life
Now the sunlight won’t touch you
(Hold your light high, don’t let it down)
You don’t feel no warmth at all
(Hold your light high, don’t let it down)
And who wouldn’t want a good, good life
All us felons want a better life
When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
Hold your light high, don't let it down
Can you see through the choke smoke
Can you see through the haze at all
There_is pain in the offering
My hands are small but they are yours
And who wouldn’t want a good, good life
All us felons want a better life
When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
When you hands feel tired
And your feet stay put
When you hands feel tired
Hold your light high, don't let it down
The nights have been so lonely since you went away
I could not get to sleep try as I may
But now you're back, and you're here to stay....
Still it looks like another sleepless_night
Oh but darlin', that's alright Just as long_as you are holdin' me tight
Makin' love 'till the early morning_light
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless_night
Hold me, while the moon shines in through the window
Let your love flow
Hold me, we can orchestrate love's scenario with the radio
Still it looks like another sleepless_night
Oh but darlin', that's alright
Just as long_as you are holdin' me tight
Hold me, while the moon shines...etc
Baby, do you understand me now, sometimes I feel a little mad
And don't you know that no_one alive can always be an_angel
When things go wrong your bound to see the bad
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree with a joy that's hard to hide
Then sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And you're bound to see the other_side
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem mean to you, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one_thing that I never mean to do, 'cause I love you
Oh baby, don't you know I'm human
I have faults like any_other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
Some foolish little sinful thing I've_done
And I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem mean to you, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one_thing that I never mean to do, 'cause I love you
Baby, don't you know I'm human
I have faults like any_other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
Some foolish little sinful thing I've_done
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh no, please don't let me be misunderstood
Seems So Long Ago, Nancy
It_seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
looking ate the Late Late show
through a semi-precious stone.
In the House of Honesty
her father was on trial,
in the House of Mystery
there was no_one at all,
there was no_one at all.
It_seems so long ago,
none_of us were strong;
Nancy wore green stockings
and she slept with everyone.
She never said she'd wait for us
although she was alone,
I think she fell in love for us
in nineteen sixty one,
in nineteen sixty one.
It_seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
a forty five beside her head,
an open telephone.
We told her she was beautiful,
we told her she was free
but none_of us would meet her in
the House of Mystery,
the House of Mystery.
And now you look around you,
see her everywhere,
many use her body,
many comb her hair.
In the hollow of the night
when you are cold and numb
you hear her talking freely then,
she's happy that you've come,
she's happy that you've come.
How do I get through
the night without you
If I had to live_without you
What kinda life
would that be
Oh I need you in my arms
need you to hold
You're my world
my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything good in my life
Without you
There would be no sun
in my sky
There would be no love
in my life
There would be no world
left for me
And I baby
I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live_without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live
If you ever leave
Baby you would
take away everything
Need you with me
Baby don't you know
that you are
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live_without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
oh how do I live
How do I live_without you
Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction
Where I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said, "Go ahead an' make a bid on that!"
An' I said, hey, pretty lady, won'cha gi'me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine

She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
An' I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!
Well, the auctioneer was goin' about a mile a minute
He was takin' bids an' callin' them out_loud
An' I guess I was really gettin' in it

With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!
Yeah, we found love on the auction block
An' I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about
The way we met that day
When I said, hey, pretty lady, won'cha gi'me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your biddin' an' be at your beckon call
Yeah, I never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man, I gotta_have her, she's a one-of-a-kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice,
I'm sold! On the lady in the second row
She's_an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten, I know
Shes's got ruby red lips, blond hair blue eyes
An' I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
놀라운 은총,너무나 달콤한 주님의 음성
That saved a wretch like me
나와같이 비참한사람들을 구해주시니
I once was lost but now I'm found,
한때 길을 잃었었지만 지금은 나의 길을 찾았어요
Was blind but now I see.
나는 눈 먼 적도 있었지만 지금은 볼수있어요
'Twas grace
Went down to Tin Pan Alley
See what was going on
Things was too hot down there
Couldn't stay very long
Hey, Alley's the roughest place
I've ever been
All the people down there
Living for their whisky, wine, and gin
I heard a woman scream
Yeah and I peeped through the door
Some cat was working on Annie with a
Lord with a two-by-four
I heard a pistol shoot
Yeah and it was a 44
Somebody killed a crap shooter
Cause he didn't shake, rattle, and roll
I saw a cop standing
With his_hand on his gun
He said "this is a raid, boy now
No, nobody run"
Hey, Alley's the roughest place
I've ever been
Yeah they took me away_from Alley
Lord they took me right back to the pen
How_many roads must a man walk down

Before she can sleep in the sand?
How_many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

The_answer is_blowing in the wind.
How_many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
How_many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How_many times can a man turn his head
and pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is_blowing in the wind

I remember Paris in '49
The Champs Elysee
San Michelle and old Beaujolais wine
I recall that you were mine
in those Parisienne days
Looking back at the photographs
Those summer days spent
outside corner cafes
Oh I could write you paragraphs
about my old Parisienne days
I've_been lately thinking
about my life's time
All the things I've_done
and how it's been
And I can't_help believin'
in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end
I've_seen a lot of sunshine
slept out in the rain
Spent a night or_two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures
had myself some friends
Spent a time or_two in my own home
I have to say it now
it's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have
a chance to hang around
Lie there by the fire and
watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my
old lady sit and pass a pipe around
And talk of poems and
prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How_long it's been since_yesterday
What about tomorrow and
what about our dreams
And all the memories we share
Days they pass so quickly now
the nights are seldom long
Time around me whispers
when it's cold
The changes somehow
frightens me still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old
Although my life's been good to me
there's still so_much to do
So_many things my mind
has never known
I'd like to raise a family
I'd like to sail_away
And dance across
the mountains on the moon
I have to say it now it's been
a good life all in all
It's really fine to have a chance
to hang around
Lie there by the fire and
watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
sit and pass a pipe around
And talk of poems and
prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How_long it's been since_yesterday
What about tomorrow and
what about our dreams
And all the memories we share
I keep drinking malted milk
trying to drive my blues away
I keep drinking malted milk
trying to drive my blues away
Baby you're just as
welcome to my loving
as the flowers is in May
Malted milk malted milk
keep rushing to my head
Malted milk malted milk
keep rushing to my head
And I have a funny funny feeling
and I'm talking all out my head
Baby fix me one_more drink
and hug your daddy one_more time
Baby fix me one_more drink
and hug your daddy one_more time
Keep on stirring
my malted milk mama
until I change my mind
My doorknob keeps on turning
there must be spooks around my bed
My doorknob keeps on turning
there must be spooks around my bed
And I have a funny funny feeling
and the hair's rising on my head
I can't stop loving you
I say I done made up my mind
To live in a memory
Of lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So, I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy, happy hours
That we once knew
So long_ago
Still makes me blue
They_say that time
Time heals a broken_heart
But mine stood still
Since we've_been apart
I can't stop loving you
I say I done made up my mind
To live in a memory
Of lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
I was afraid the table going to break down or something
So, I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

Sitting on a sofa
on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it
shout about it
When you've_got to choose
Every way you look_at it you lose
Where have you gone
Joe DiMaggio A nation turns
its lonely eyes to you
Woo woo woo
What's that you say
Mrs_Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
Hey_hey hey_hey hey_hey
I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket to my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
Homeward_bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward_bound,
Home_where my thought's escaping,
Home_where my music's playing,
Home_where my love lies_waiting
Silently_for me.
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward_bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward_bound,
Home_where my thought's escaping,
Home_where my music's playing,
Home_where my love lies_waiting
Silently_for me.
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come_back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
Homeward_bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward_bound,
Home_where my thought's escaping,
Home_where my music's playing,
Home_where my love lies_waiting
Silently_for me.
Silently_for me.
Time it was, and what a time it was, it was
A time of innocence, a time of confidences
Long ago, it must be, I have a photograph
Preserve your memories, they're all that's left you
Have you seen the old_man
In the closed down market
Kicking up the papers with his worn_out shoes
In his eyes you see no pride
Hands held loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper, telling yesterday's news
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind
Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind
In the old night cafe at a quarter past eleven
The same_old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone
So how can you tell me that you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind
Have you seen the old_man
Outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the minor ribands that he wears
In our city winter the rain cries little pity
For one_more forgotten hero
And a world which doesn't care
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you.
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no_one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you.
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you.
Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly
across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you.
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving
free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget_about today until tomorrow.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
I'm not_sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey!_Mr. Tambourine_Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle_jangle morning I'll come_followin' you.
Are you going to
Scarborough_Fair
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Remember me
to one who_lives there
She once was
a true love of mine
Tell_her to make me
a cambric shirt
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
Without no seams
nor needless work
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell_her to find me
an acre of land
Parsley_sage rosemary

Between the salt water
and the sea strand
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Tell_her to reap it
with a sickle of leather
Parsley_sage rosemary
and_thyme
And gather it all
in a bunch of heather
Then_she'll be
a true love of mine
Are you going to
Scarborough_Fair
Parsley_sage rosemary

Remember me
to one who_lives there
She once was
a true love of mine
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way
Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Watch out stray cat,
The little red rooster's on the prowl
If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
Been no peace in the barnyard
Since that little red rooster's been gone
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way

Written By WILLIE DIXON
Outside the sun is shining, it's such a pretty day
I'm waitin' in the shadows watchin' you and Joey play
Right now I feel like dyin' 'cause I heard Joey say
"All the other kids I know have daddies everyday"
"Oh Daddy, please ask Mommy, could you come home to stay?
Me and Mommy need you, I love you anyway
All the other kids I know have daddies everyday"
Honey, I've_been thinkin', our little Joey's bright
He doesn't understand our little childish grownup fights
You're just his Sunday Daddy, could you come home to stay?
'Cause all the other kids he knows have daddies everyday
"Oh Daddy, please ask Mommy, could you come home to stay?
Me and Mommy need you, I love you anyway
All the other kids I know have daddies everyday"
You, I know you're everything
That I've_been looking_for
And I, I look into your eyes
And could not ask for more
So it's only fair to lay it on the line
Hold on, I'm gonna need a little time
But if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken_heart can mend
I know it's gonna be with you
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again
Scared, I guess I'm scared to fly
It's such a long way down
And yet, if you'd just trust in me
I'm sure, I'd come around
And I know when you're hurt
It's hard to let someone inside
In your arms I feel I'm ready now to try
So if I ever ...
I'd be a fool to ever let you go
You're the best_thing in my life
When I know I've gotta take it slow
I know ...
Wake up, little_Susie, wake_up
Wake up, little_Susie, wake_up
We've both been sound asleep, wake up, little_Susie, and weep
The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep
Wake_up little_Susie
Wake_up little_Susie, well
Whatta we gonna tell your_mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say 창??ooh-la-la창??
Wake_up little_Susie
Wake_up little_Susie, well
I told your_mama that you'd be in by ten
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed again
Wake_up little_Susie
Wake_up little_Susie, we gotta go home
Wake up, little_Susie, wake_up
Wake up, little_Susie, wake_up
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot
Wake_up little_Susie
Wake_up little_Susie, well
Whatta we gonna tell your_mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say 창??ooh-la-la창??
Wake_up little_Susie
Wake_up little_Susie
Wake_up little_Susie
I am just a poor boy
나는 가난한 사내
Though my story's seldom told
사람들은 내 이야기를 잘 모르겠지만
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
주머니 한 가득 채워 줄 거란 말
있는 힘을 다해 주먹을 날렸었지
Such are promises
그런 약속을 믿었어
All lies, and jests
모두 거짓과 허풍일 뿐이련안
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
인간은 원하는 말만 들으려고 하고
And disregards the rest
다른 것에 대해선 고개 돌려버리지
When I left my home and my family
내가 집과 가족을 떠났을때
I was no more_than a boy
나는 그저 소년에 불과했었어
In the company of strangers
낯선 군중들
In the quiet of the railway station
기차역의 적막 속에서
Running scared
겁에 질려 달음질치며
Llaying low
보일 듯 말 듯 웅크린 채
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
누더기를 걸친 이들이 살아가는
빈민가를 찾아 헤매다
Looking_for the places only they would know
오직 그들만이 알고 있는 그런 곳을 전전했었지
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la--la-lie
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la-la-la-lie
Asking only workman's wages
막노동의 대가 정도만 바라며
I come looking_for a job
일자리를 찾아 다녔지만
But I get no offers
아무도 일을 안 주더군
Just a "come on" from the whores
on seventh Avenue
7번가 창녀들의 유혹의 말 외에는
I do declare there were times
그래, 난 말할 수 있어
When I was so_lonesome
너무나 외로웠을 땐
I took some comfort there
나도 그런 곳에서 평안을 구했어
Ooo-la-la
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la--la-lie
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la-la-la-lie
Then I'm laying out my winterclothes
그러다간 겨울 옷가지를 늘어놓고
And wishing I was gone, going home
떠나고 싶어하는 거야, 집으로 가고 있다면
Where the New_York City
winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home
뉴욕의 매서운 겨울바람에도 살갗 터지지 않는
눈물 흘리지 않는 그 곳, 집으로
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
텅 빈 벌판 위
싸움으로 돈을 버는 한 권투 선수가 서 있다
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till_he cried out
그 얼굴의 상처들은, 자신을 무너뜨리고
고통으로 비명 지를 때까지 찍어 내리던
그 모든 주먹의 기억을 싣고 있지
In his anger and his shame
분노와 치욕 속에서 되뇌이는 건
I am leaving, I am leaving
떠나야지, 떠나야지
But the fighter still_remains
하지만, 선수는 아직 떠나지 못해요
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la--la-lie
Lie-la-lie Lie-la-la-la-la-la-lie

Bye_Bye Love
Bye_Bye Happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye_Bye Love
Bye_Bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye my love goodbye
Bye my love goodbye
There_goes my baby
With someone_new
She sure looks happy
I sure am blue
She was my baby till_he stepped in
Goodbye to romance
That might have been
(* Repeat)
I'm through with romance
I'm through with love
I'm through with
Counting that stars above
And here's the reason
That I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me
(* Repeat twice)
내 사랑아, 잘가요
(*)
내 사랑아 잘_가
행복아 너도 잘_가
외로움아 반갑구나
울음이 나올 것만 같아
사랑이여 잘_가
달콤한 손길과도 헤어져야 하는구나
죽고 싶은 생각이 들어
내 사랑이여 안녕
내 사랑이여 안녕
내 애인이 낯선 사람과
함께 가고 있어
확실히 그녀는 행복해 보여
나는 이렇게 우울한데
그 사람이 우리사이에 끼어들기 전까지는
그녀는 나의 연인이었는데
연애가 아니었을지도 모르지만
연애여 안녕
(* 반복)
나는 연애로 부터 해방되었어
사랑도 끝장이 나버렸어
하늘의 별을 세어 보는 일도
이제는 끝이야
내가 자유로와진 이유는
여기에 있지
그것은 내 사랑하는 연인과
헤어졌다는 것이야
(* 두번 반복)
this is my song for the asking
ask me and i will play
so sweetly i´ll make you smile
this is my dream for the taking
take it, don´t turn away
all the love that i feel inside
thinking it over i´d be sad,
thinking it over i´m more_than glad to change my ways
for the asking
ask me and i will play
i´ve been waiting here all my life.
And what will happen in the morning when the world it gets
so crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.
And what will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel
with the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.
And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
and so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.
What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
in the morning.
Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part_of a chain
Take off your eyeshade
Start over again.
Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.
Let's sing a song
For Hazey Jane
She's back again in my mind.
If songs were lines
In a conversation
The situation would be fine.
Help me
I think I'm falling
In love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know
I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble
'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet-taIking-ladies man
And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom
Help me
I think I'm falling
In love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future
And worrying about the past
'Cause I've_seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom
Didn't it feel good
We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking
Didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady
With the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good
Help me
I think I'm falling
In love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around
Flirting and flirting
Hurting too
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom
When I think back
On all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder I can think at all
And though my lack of education
Hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny_day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew
When I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match
my sweet imagination
Everything looks worse in black and white
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny_day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Delores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
I know a woman
Became a wife
These_are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She_said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She_said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip_slidin' away
How_many roads
must a man walk down
before you call
him a man?
How_many seas
must a white dove sail
before she sleeps
in the sand?
How_many times
must the cannon balls
fly before
they're forever banned?
The_answer my friend
is_blowing in the wind
The_answer
is_blowing in the wind~
How_many years
can a mountain exist
before it's washed
to the sea?
How_many years
can some people exist
before they're allowed
to be free?
How_many times
can a man turn
his head pretending
he just doesn't see?
The_answer my friend
is_blowing in the wind
The_answer
is_blowing in the wind~
How_many times
must a man look up
before he can see
the sky?
How_many ears
must one man have
before he can
people cry?
How_many deaths will
it take till_he knows
That too_many people
have died?
The_answer my friend
is_blowing in the wind
The_answer
is_blowing in the wind~
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say_goodbye
But the dawn is breakin', it's esrly morn
The taxi's waiting, hi's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so_lonesome I could cry.
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll_wait for me
Hold me like you'll_never let me go.
I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
There's so_many times I've let you down
So_many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I think of you
Every song I sing, I sing for you
When I come_back, I'll wear your wedding ring.
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll_wait for me
Hold me like you'll_never let me go.
I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
Now the time has come to leave you
One_more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say,
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll_wait for me
Hold me like you'll_never let me go.
I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
Beneath still waters
Ther's a strong undertow
The surface won't tell you
What the deep water knows
Darling, I'm saying
I know something's wrong
Beneath syill waters
Your love is gone
Even a fool could see
That you'll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart
Must take its turn at misery
And this time it's me
And I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Even a fool could see
That you'll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart
Must take its turn at misery
And this time it's me
And I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Well look_at all those fancy clothes
But these could keep us warm
Just like those.
And what about your soul
Is it cold
Is it straight from the mold
And ready to be sold.
And cars and phones and diamond rings
Bling, bling
Those are only removable things
And what about your mind
Does it shine
Or are there things that concern you more
Than your time
Gone going
Gone everything
Gone give a damn
Gone be the birds when they dont want to sing
Gone people
All awkward with their things
Gone
Well look_at you out to make a deal
You try to be appealing but you lose youre appeal
And what about those shoes youre in today
Theyll do no good
All the bridges you burnt a long the way
Youre willing to sell anything
Gone with your herd
Leave your footprints
And well shame them with our words
Gone people
All careless and consumed
Gone
Gone going
Gone everything
Gone give a damn
Gone be the birds when they dont want to sing
Gone people
All awkward with their things
Gone
I've got nothing on my mind: Nothing to remember,
Nothing to forget. And I've got nothing to regret,
But I'm all tied up on the inside,
No one knows quite what I've got;
And I know that on the outside
What I used_to be, I'm not anymore.
You know I've heard about people like me,
But I never made the connection.
They walk one road to set them free
And find they've gone the wrong direction.
But there's_no need for turning back
`Cause all roads lead to where I stand.
And I believe I'll walk them all
No_matter what I may have planned.
Can you remember who I was? Can you still feel it?
Can you find my pain? Can you heal it?
Then lay your hands upon me now
And cast this darkness from my soul.
You alone can light my way.
You alone can make me whole once again.
We've walked both_sides of every street
Through all kinds_of windy weather.
But that was never our defeat
As_long as we could walk together.
So there's_no need for turning back
`Cause all roads lead to where we stand.
And I believe we'll walk them all
No_matter what we may have planned.
And if she_asks you why you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired_of Castles in the Air
I've got a dream I want the world to share in castle walls
Just leave me to despair
Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky
A dream come true, I
I'm coming_home
I've_done my time
Now I've got to know
what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter
telling you I'd soon be free
Then you'll know
just what to do if you still want me
If you still want me
Oh tie a yellow ribbon_round
the old_oak tree
It's been three long years
Do you still want me Still want me
If I don't see a ribbon_round
the old_oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon_round
the old_oak tree
Bus driver please look for me
Cause I couldn't bear to see
what I might see
I'm really still in prison
and my love she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's
what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please
Oh tie a yellow ribbon_round
the old_oak tree
It's been three long years
Do you still want me Still want me
If I don't see a ribbon_round
the old_oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon_round
the old_oak tree
Now the whole damn bus is cheering
And I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons round
the old_oak tree
I'm coming_home mm hmm
Tie a ribbon_round the old_oak tree
Tie a ribbon_round the old_oak tree
Tie a ribbon_round the old_oak tree
Tie a ribbon_round the old_oak tree
Tie a ribbon_round the old_oak tree
Tie a ribbon_round the old_oak tree
There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known.
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done.
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.
An' I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays.
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made.
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do, mmm, mmm.

When you put your arms_around me,
You let me know there's_nothing in this world I can't do.

Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, mmm, mmm.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.
Whoa here we go now!
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,
Shinin' down on me and you.
When you put your arms_around me,

Sometimes it's hard for me to understand,
But you're teachin' me to be a better man.
I don't want to take this life for_granted like I used_to do, no, no.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.
I'm ready to love somebody,
Love somebody like you. Oooh.
An' I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you, yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh, I wanna be the man in the middle_of the night,
Shinin' like it's true.
I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah...
We are just shadows
Crawling through this micro alley
But I am hungry for your love
And I am starving for a better time
But That's all we got here
That's all we know
That's all we're become
Our recognition
Yeah well we be walking in
Some kind_of direction
In a line with our right foot first
Yes we're waiting_for some material heaven
That will, that will quench our thirst
But that's all we got here
That's all we know
That's all we're become
Our recognition
And I don't know what to do
About holding my head_high
I am struggling to breathe through all these
In between times
And I am wondering why
I am wondering why
And I was_born into this place
That filters who we are
By what we have done
Yes I know I am a product of this institution
That's all I got yeah
That's all I know
That's all i've become
My recognition oh
And I don't know what to do
About holding my head_high
I am struggling to breathe through all these
In between times
And I am wondering why
I am wondering why
If trouble was money, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire
If trouble was money, babe, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire
For you I'd buy the whole world, woman, I'd buy the whole_world and have money to spare, yeah
Worry, worry, worry, worry, babe, I had worries on my mind, yeah

She said, "I always want you to be a winner", she said,_"Son, I don't want you to quit"

I want to say
I love you
Let me hold you in my arms
forever more
You have gone
and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh
we belong together
Won't you believe in my song
Lady
for so_many years
I thought_I'd never find you
You have come into my life
and made me whole
Forever
let me wake
to see you each
and every morning
Let me hear you
whisper softly
in my ear
In my eyes
I see no_one else but you
There's_no other
love like our love
And yes
oh yes
I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you
for so long
Lady
your love's the only
love I need
And beside me
is where
I want you to be
Cause my love
there's something
I want you to know
You're the love of my life
you're my lady
Time,
Time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities.
I was so hard to please.
Look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.
Hear the Salvation Army band.
Down by the riverside's
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've_got planned.
Carry your cup in your hand.
And look around.
Leaves are brown.
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.
Hang on to your hopes, my friend.
That's an easy thing to say,
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again.
Look around,
The grass is high,
The fields are ripe,
It's the springtime of my life.
Seasons change with the scenery;
Weaving time in a tapestry.
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
Looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme.
Drinking my vodka and lime,
I look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.
Sometimes I wounder
Why I spend the lonely night
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my memory
And I am once again you
When our love is new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long_ago
And now my consolation
Is in star dust of sun
Beside the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in arms
The nightingale tells his fairy_tales
Of paradise where roses grow
Though I dream them in my heart
They always will remain
My stardust memory
The memory of loves refrain
And though I dream in vain
In my heart it will always will remain
My stardust memory
The memory of loves refrain
If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next_teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next_teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next_teardrop falls
Alli estare candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next_teardrop falls
I'll be there, I'll be there
Before the next_teardrop falls
There you were standin' in the shadows
Well I just looked where
I don't see
I'm still pretendin I don't need you
I won't let you know you're killin me
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
I'm actin like it doesn't_matter
And you sneak up from
Behind and whisper my name
There_goes your paralyzin eyes
There_goes your tantalizin smile
There_goes my act of playin it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games
I wanted to play
There_goes my heart fallin for you
Well I think you're playin with me darlin
You like to see what you can do
Well I should be fishin for Blue Marlin
Instead of bein hooked again by you
There_goes your paralyzin eyes
There_goes your tantalizin smile
There_goes my act of playin it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games
I wanted to play
There_goes my heart fallin for you
Yeah there goes your paralyzin eyes
There_goes your tantalizin smile
There_goes my heart fallin for you
There_goes my heart fallin for you
Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday_night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never_knew how_much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday_night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never_knew how_much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never_knew how_much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Yeah, that's right.
I know your leavin'
I see the signs
You're gonna walk out on
this heart of mine
You'll never call me
You'll never write
You've made your mind up
your gone tonight
If some rainy day you're
all alone
You feel like talking you
can log me on
At www dot memory
I'll be waiting_for you
patiently
If you feel the need just
click on me
At www dot memory
You won't even have to
hold me
Or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you
love me
Through your keyboard
and wires
No you won't have to
touch me
Or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse
around
Until you see it land
At www dot memory
I'll be waiting_for you
patiently
If you feel the need just
click on me
At www dot memory
If you feel like love just
click on me
At www dot memory
Would you go with me
if we rolled down streets of fire
Would you ohold on to me tighter
as the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down
Would you go with me
if we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer
until the trip was over
and would it be okay if i didn't know th way
If i gave you my hand would you take it
and make me the happiest man in the world
If i told you my heart couldn't beat
one_more minute without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so, so would you go with me
Would you go with me
if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free would you go with me
If i gave you my hand would you take it
and make me the happiest man in the world
If i told you my heart couldn't beat
one_more minute without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner_or later
God'll_cut you down
Sooner_or later
God'll_cut you down
Go_tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler
the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut 'em down
Well my goodness gracious
let me tell you the news
My head's been wet
with the midnight dew
I've_been down on bended knee
talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice
so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle
of the angel's feet
He called my name
and my heart stood still
When he said
John go do My will
Go_tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler
the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut 'em down
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner_or later
God'll_cut you down
Sooner_or later
God'll_cut you down
Well you may throw your rock
and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark
against your fellow man
But as sure as
God_made black and white
What's down in the dark will be
brought to the light
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner_or later
God'll_cut you down
Sooner_or later
God'll_cut you down
Go_tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler
the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna
cut you down
Adios amigo, adios my friend
The road we have travelled has come to an end
When two love the same love, one love has to lose
And it's you who she longs for, it's you she will choose
Adios compadre, what must be must be
Remember to name one muchacho for me
I ride to the Rio, where my life I must spend
Adios amigo, adios my friend
Adios compadre, let us shed no tears
May all your ma챰anas bring joy through the years
Away from these memories, my life I must spend
Adios amigo, adios my friend
They didn't have you where I come from
Never_knew the best was yet to come
Life began when I saw your_face
And I hear your laugh like a serenade
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up
I slip in bed when you're asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there'll_be so_much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up
As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles_away
And hear my voice like a serenade
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How_long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up
Is forever enough
Cause I'm never, never giving you up
You can hold her hand
And show her how you cry
Explain to her your weakness
So she understands
And then roll over and die
You can brave decisions
Before you crumble up inside
Spend your time asking everyone else's permission
Then run_away and hide
Or you can sit on chimneys
Put some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're_doing or waiting_for
But if anyone should ask
Tell them I've_been licking coconut skins
And we've_been hanging out
Tell them God just dropped by to forgive our sins
And relieve us our doubt
La_la la_la la_la la...
Oh you can hold her eggs
But your basket has a hole
You can lie between her legs and go looking_for
Tell_her you're searching for her soul
You can wait for ages
Watch your compost turn to coal
Time is contagious
Everybody's getting old
So you can sit on chimneys
Put some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're_doing or looking_for
But if anyone should ask
Tell them I've_been cooking coconut skins
And we've_been hanging out
Tell them God just dropped by to forgive our sins
And relieve us our doubt
La_la la_la la_la la...
My baby makes me proud, Lord don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk, Lord, how they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights, I know she'll_be leaving with me:
And when w
what a dream I had
Pressed in Organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smocky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on
And when you ran to me
Your cheeks fleshed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand
And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh,I live you girl
Oh,I love you
Bell bottom blues, you made me cry.
I don't want to lose this feeling.
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms.
Do you want to see me
crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade_away.
Give me one_more day, please.
I don't want to fade_away.
In your heart I want to stay.
It's all wrong, but it's all right.
The way that you treat me baby.
Once I was strong but I lost the fight.
You won't find a better loser.
Chorus
Chorus
Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye.
I'm sure we're gonna meet again,
And if we do, don't you be_surprised
If you find me with another lover.
Chorus
I don't want to fade_away.
Give me one_more day please.
I don't want to fade_away.
In your heart I long to stay.
I've_been awake for a while now
You've_got me
feelin' like a child now
'Cause every_time
I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place
it starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Where ever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please_stay for a while now
Just take your time
Where ever you go
The rain is falling
on my window_pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore
it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Where ever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please_stay for a while now
Just take your time
Where ever you go
What am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way
I just
And they start in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Where ever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please_stay for a while now
Just take your time
Where ever you go
I've_been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
Cause every_time
you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to
feel your warmth
it starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feeling shows
cause you make me smile baby
Just take your time now
Holdin' me tight
Where ever where ever
where ever you go
Where ever where ever
wherever you go
where ever you go
I always know
Cause you make me smile
Even just for a while
Mother don't worry, I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother don't worry, I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Mother remember being so stern with that girl who was with me
Mother remember the blink_of an_eye when I breathed through your body
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying upwards over the mountain
Mother I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prison
Mother I lost it all of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother forget me now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother forgive me I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons can be birds taken broken up to the mountain
Mother don't worry I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother don't worry she's got a garden we're it planting together
Mother remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry
Blood on the floor and the fleas in their paws
And you cried 'til the morning
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds flying always over the mountain
if you were coming in the fall,
i`d brush the summer by
with half a smile and half a spum,
as housewives do a fly.
if i could see you in a year,
i`d wind the months in balls,
and put them each in separate
drawers,
until their time befalls.
if only centuries delayed,
i`d count them on my hand,
subtracting till my fingers dropped
into Van Diemen`s Iand.
if certain, when this life was out,
that yours and mine should be,
i`d toss it yonder like a rind,
and taste eternity.
but now, all ignorant of the length
of time`s uncertain wing,
it goads me, like the goblin bee,
that will not state its sting.
Bell bottom blues, you made me cry.
I don't want to lose this feeling.
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms.
Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade_away.
Give me one_more day, please.
I don't want to fade_away.
In your heart I want to stay.
It's all wrong, but it's all right.
The way that you treat me baby.
Once I was strong but I lost the fight.
You won't find a better loser.

I took a chance i took a shot
and you might think
i'm bulletproof but i'm not
you took a swing
i took it hard and down here
from the ground i see who you are
I'm sick and tired_of your attitude
I'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me
then you cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover
when you're around
and here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said
last_night and i know that you
see what you're_doing to me
tell me why
You could write a book on
how to ruin someone's perfect day
well i get so confused
and frustrated
forget what i'm trying to say
I'm sick and tired_of your reasons
I got no_one to believe in
you tell me that you want me
then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover
when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said
last_night and i know that you
see what you're_doing to me
tell me why
why do you have to make me feel
small so you can feel whole inside
why do you have to
put down my dreams so you're
the only thing on my mind
i'm sick and tired_of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me
then cut me down
i'm sick and tired_of your reasons
i've_got no_one to believe in
you ask me for my love
then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said
last_night and i know that you
see what you're_doing to me
tell me why why tell me why
i take a step back let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you know
Gone she`s gone
How do you feel about it?
That`s what I thought
You`re real torn up about it
And I wish you the best
But I could do without it
And I will because you`ve worn me down
Oh, I will because you`ve worn me down
Worn me down like a road
I did_everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did_everything to please you
But you can’t stop_thinking about her
No, you can’t stop_thinking about her
And you`re wrong. You`re wrong
I`m not overreacting
Something is off
Why don`t we ever believe ourselves?
And I, oh I, I feel that word for you
And I will because you’ve worn me down
And I will because you have worn me down
Worn me down like a road
I did_everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did_everything to please
But you can`t stop_thinking about her
No, you can`t stop_thinking about her
She`s so pretty
She`s so damn right
But I`m so tired_of thinking
about her, again, tonight
Worn me down like a road
I did_everything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did_everything to please you
Worn me down like a road
I did_everything you told me to do
But you, you can’t stop_thinking about her
No, you can`t stop_thinking about her
No, you can`t stop_thinking about her
No, you can`t stop_thinking of her -
Semalam I call you, you tak answer,
You kata you keluar pergi dinner
You kata you keluar dengan kawan you
But when I called Tommy he said it wasn't true
So I drove my car pergi Damansara
Tommy kata maybe you tengok bola
Tapi bila I sampai, you, you tak ada?
Lagi lah jadi gila
So I called and called sampai you answer
You kata "Sorry sayang tadi tak dengar"
"My phone was on silent, I was at the gym"
Tapi latar belakang suara perempuan lain
Sudahlah sayang, I, don't believe you,
I've always known that your words were never true
Why am I with you, I pun tak tau!
No wonder lah my friends pun tak suka you
So I guess_that's the end of our story,
Akhir kata, she accepted his apology
Tapi last last kita dapat tau
She was cheating too
With her exboyfriend's best friend,
Tommy
Kantoi
Yesterday's a haze
I'm drunk and I've_been
drinking for days
Slurring all the time
Pouring poison wine
down my spine
Bottles in the hall
Breaking in the fall
From a paper bag
Everything's a mess
I'm tired and depressed
And every_single day
is a drag
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says stop
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says
never mind
Wrinkles in my face
I'm older now in
so_many ways
In and out of style
Worried and confused
like a child
Shoot me into space
Or take me to the place
I was_born into
Heaven has sign
It says Access is denied
When you act_like you
Shoot me into space
Or take me to the place
I was_born into
Heaven has sign
It says Access is denied
When you act_like you
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says stop
See if you can wake me up
Before my heart says never mind

I drive away_from your house, chasin'_butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
I said Girl, you're beautiful, 'n' you already_know it
But I'll say it again and a million_times after that
You laugh and you shake your head and say Boy, you're crazy
Well, girl, if I'm crazy, I'm only crazy 'bout you
I was lookin' right into your eyes, right then, porch light
Flipped on and I saw your dad lookin' through the window
Hope he ain't mad
Then I helped you outta my truck,through the yard to your front_door
Said Girl, am I gonna see you again You answered me back with a kiss
I drive away_from your house, chasin'_butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say I love you out_loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said She's the one
Said Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name
Like a merry go round, got my head_spinnin' round and round and round
That's_just what you do,_do, do,_do, do,_do, do to me
I picked you up for our second date, you're sure lookin' pretty
Sweet as an angel, here to save my soul
Mmm, yea, you get me high, you take me to heaven
And I get to shakin' when you put your_lips on mine
It could be the best night of my life, least 'til next time
Oh yea, gotta get this right, follow all the rules and be back by 9
Pulled up to drop you off, leanin' in to sneak one_more
Said Baby, when can I see you again How 'bout every night after this
I drive away_from your house, chasin'_butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say I love you out_loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said She's the one
Said Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name
Like a merry go round, got my head_spinnin' round and round and round
That's_just what you do,_do, do,_do, do,_do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do,_do, do,_do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do
I drive away_from your house, chasin'_butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say I love you out_loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said She's the one
Said Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name
Like a merry go round, got my head_spinnin' round and round and round
That's_just what you do,_do, do,_do, do,_do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do,_do, do,_do, do,_do, do to me
I'm not here to startle you
Hell, I only came
'cause you asked me to
It's such a shame
that we can't renew
All those feelings
that we shared back
a month or_two
You know, I kept everything
that reminds me of us
It sounds weird
but your picture's still hung up
I've tried getting distracted
by other stuff
But that's not enough
I'm sleeping with a pillow,
under lamplight
Freezing cold,
'cause you always
liked the windows
Opened wide
Just so you know, I'll be here
when you make it home
I'll call you up at like 3am,
again
Just to make sure you know
that I don't mind waiting
Although the call will end
with us both saying
That we_both hate this
I'm not sleeping too_well,
now I'm sleeping alone
And all you have
to do is pick_up the phone
And I'll come running
to your aid
but I'm sure you know
This won't help us grow
I'm still sleeping
with a pillow, under lamplight
Freezing cold,
'cause you always
liked the windows opened wide
Just so you know,
I'll be here
when you make it home
I'm sleeping with a pillow,
under lamplight
Freezing cold,
'cause you always
liked the windows
Opened wide
Just so you know, I'll be here
when you make it home
Just once in my life
If I could find someone, if once
The feeling was right
I'd never let her go
I'd always be there
If I could have my chance to be
The only one
It just isn't fair
If I could hold on to love
I'd never let it go
I'd keep it right next to my heart
If I could hold her tonight
She'd never leave my side
If I could only hold on to love
I'm searching my dreams
I'm trying to recognize that face
Oh, who can it be?
She's calling out to me and now I'm
Running to her
But every_time I get this close
She vanishes
Into the night
If I could hold on to love
I'd never let it go
I'd keep it right next to my heart
If I could hold her tonight
She'd never leave my side
If I could only hold on to love
Is it ever come to pass
That I find a love that lasts
Or is that too_much to ask?
If I could hold her tonight
She'd never leave my side
If I could only hold on to love
If I could only hold on to love
Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T top
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and daddy put their roots right_here
'Cause this is where the car broke_down
Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust
Pickin' us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A C in the vents
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New_York to LA
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin' up in little pink houses
Makin' out on living_room couches
Blowin' that smoke on Saturday_night
A little messed up, but we're all alright
Baptist church parkin' lot, tryin' not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin' it to second base, but sayin' you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
Now he's sittin' out back, 3030 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA

She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting_go
So give me one_more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
It_was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first_time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She_said I'm sorry for the way
I've_been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting_go
So give me one_more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting_go
So give me one_more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, wow, ohhhhh
They roll the sidewalks in this town
All up after the sun goes down
They_say nothin' good happens here
When midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain
I can't sleep with you on my_brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
Now all the stars are turnin' blue
Just kissed the clock 222
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold
Nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
This DJ's on a roll
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one_more trip around the moon
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight
I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy,_make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy,_make it fine
High ends in the fire moving on, moving on
Torn apart and tired_of it_all, of it all
Walk, never the same
Feel no glory, feel no pain
I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy,_make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy,_make you fine
Shaking out the sheets and holding on, holding on
Following my feet until it's done, until it's gone
It's dead and gone
Never the same
Feel no glory, feel no pain
I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy,_make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy,_make it fine
It's the one I want now
You'll never do wrong
You'll never do wrong
Did I ever,_ever
Ever do you wrong
I could make you want me
Make you need me, make you mine
I could make it holy,_make it special
Make it right
I could make you want me
Make you need me all the time
I could make it holy,_make it fine
They're blowing up our phones, asking where we are
Just say we're almost there we ain't even in the car
You're rolling one for two and I'm still picking out my shoes
I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged
We're gonna look real good, but we're gonna look real rude
I'm sorry I'm not_sorry that I'm
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
Let's promise when we get in that we'll try to get right out
Fake a_couple conversations, make the necessary rounds
These kinda things just turn into who's leaving here with who
But I just want 'em all to see me come in
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
x2
Oh, I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world, all that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel,all my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I,
I do, cherish you
For the rest_of my life
you don't have to think_twice
I will, love you still
From the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do
In my world, before you
I lived outside my emotions, didn't know where I was going
'til that day, I found you
how you opened my life to a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart until my dying day
[repeat chorus]
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do, oh, I do
All my friends and lovers, there's something I'd like to say
If you feel you've lost a little faith along the way
If you ever wondered how you came to be here
I need to tell you that you've_got nothing to fear
Cause there are reasons for the way that this world works
There are reasons I know, sometimes it still hurts
Don't worry, don't worry, if you can't find love in a hurry
Don't fret, don't fret, know love hasn't given up yet
It's hard_worn, hard_worn, and love doesn't care what you've_done
There's someone here for everyone
Now all my sisters, brothers, all of my mothers sons
And all my childhood lovers, and others that I've run from
Cause there are reasons for the way that this world spins
There are reasons, and if you can't find your way in
Don't worry, don't worry, if you can't find love in a hurry
Don't fret, don't fret, know love hasn't given up yet
It's hard_worn, hard_worn, and love doesn't care what you've_done
There's someone here for everyone
And if you're still waiting_for that chance to come your way
Hold on, hold on, hold Ooonnnn
Everyone
Everyone
Cause there are reasons for the way that this world works
There are reasons I know, sometimes it still hurts
Don't worry, don't worry, if you can't find love in a hurry
Don't fret, don't fret, know love hasn't given up yet
It's hard_worn, hard_worn, and love doesn't care what you've_done
There's someone here for everyone
There's someone here for everyone
What doesn't kill you
makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul
growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
one_more moment of this silence
The loneliness is killing me
And the weight of the world's
getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay
and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake
and bring me home again
Who will fix me now
Dive in when I'm down
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
Who will make me fight
Drag me out alive
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
What doesn't destroy you
leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul
growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
one_more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's
getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay
and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake
and bring me home again
Who will fix me now
Dive in when I'm down
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
Who will make me fight
Drag me out alive
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
'Cause you know that I can't
do this on my own
Who will fix me now
Who will fix me now
Who will fix me now
Dive in when I'm down
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
You've_been out riding fences for so long now
Oh you're a hard one
But I know that you've_got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you will hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
The queen of hearts is always your best bet
Well it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get
Desperado
you know you ain't getting younger
Your pain and your hunger are driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
Sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny_how the feeling goes away
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be raining
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
Let somebody love you
Before it's too_late
Well I've loved, I've lost
But I still can't find
The way to the middle_of my heart
And I open my eyes and I don't know why
But I feel so old
You don't know what you've_got but you've_got to let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, I know
You don't know what you've_got but you've_got to let it go
Well the sun will set on my sins tonight
But the weight's been lifted off my heart
And is it all that much just for me to ask that the truth be told
You don't know what you've_got but you've_got to let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, I know
You don't know what you've_got but you've_got to let it go
You don't know what you've_got but you've_got to let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, I know
You don't know what you've_got but you've_got to let it go
You don't know what you've_got but you've_got to let it go
It’s sometimes crazy
when you wait away
Like there’s no hope
and nothing matters today
The city’s burning
I must find a way to live
‘Til I can learn to forgive
But I don’t know
I don’t know I don’t know
I don’t know if I can dig so deep
Anticipating the next time
we will meet
I fear to find just
what tomorrow will bring
But I pray it’s a better
version of yesterday
And oh I miss those_times
We would fall_asleep while
we were still on the line
All those_times
when we would talk_about
How happy we would be
I still wish it were you and me
Because you got me twisted oh girl
I’m down on my knees
I’m_beggin you
Oh I’m_beggin you please
Will you stand_by me
And I will whisper softly
how_much you mean to me
how_much you mean to me girl
Her laugh her smile
are the things that light up my day
Memories of her
in my head still not fading away
Wish she’d stay say okay
please don’t go away
Please don’t go away because
I find myself smiling every_time
I think of you
There’s risks I have to take
I said this is our fate
This time let’s make things
go our way
And oh I miss those_times
We would fall_asleep while
we were still on the line
All those_times
when we would talk_about
How happy we would be
I still wish it were you and me
Because you got me twisted oh girl
I’m down on my knees
I’m_beggin you
Oh I’m_beggin you please
Will you stand_by me
And I will whisper softly
how_much you mean to me
You and me
You amaze me
Me without you
oh baby that’s crazy
Won’t you come over
and save me
And oh I miss those_times
We would fall_asleep
while we were still on the line
All those_times
when we would talk_about
How happy we would be
I still wish it were you and me
Because you got me twisted oh girl
I’m down on my knees
I’m_beggin you
Oh I’m_beggin you please
Will you stand_by me
And I will whisper softly
how_much you mean to me
how_much you mean to me girl
I was Cleopatra
I was young and an_actress
When you knelt by my mattress
and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it
as I laid in a black_dress
With my father in a casket
I had no plans
And I left the footprints
the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did
when you left town
But I must admit it
that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife
I'd be your mistress
just to have you around
But I was late for this late for that
late for the love of my life
And when I die alone when I die alone
when I die I'll be on time
While the church discouraged
any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh it was my currency
but I held true
So I drive a taxi
and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat
they remind me of you
But I was late for this
late for that
late for the love of my life
And when I die alone
when I die alone
when I die I'll be on time
And the only gifts from my Lord
were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script
and the costume fits
so I'll play my part
I was Cleopatra
I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now
gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes
leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end
I won't be late for this late for that
late for the love of my life
And when I die alone when I die alone
when I die I'll be on time
I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake_up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't_help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake_up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't_help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
How not to
Mmmmmm
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I pretend
when I look in your eyes
Don't know where you're going
Don't come_back
please come_back tonight
Just about the only thing
left is a lie
I wonder where you are
Then I wonder
But I won't wonder anymore
And I can see you now
Sitting there in front
of the station
Feel the rain fall down again
I'd love to be there now
but I'm heading
in the other direction
Feel the rain fall
Feel the rain fall
Why is the moon so bright
Why are you so nice
See you alone
at the Walgreens at night
I used_to think
that you'd always return
to your woman in waiting
My love belongs to no_one
And just about the only thing
left is a lie
I wonder where you are
Then I wonder again
And I can see you now
Sitting there in front
of the station
Feel the rain fall down again
That Sunday_morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No_one's ever gonna love you more_than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me
Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No_one's ever gonna love you more_than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'm part_of you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No_one's ever gonna love you more_than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally
God, your mama, and me
It’s been raining all summer
All summer
We’re stuck inside
with a million regrets
Lit by the blue light from your TV set
And I’m walking
And I’m walking home
as the day breaks
Mulling over my mistakes
Head full cocaine
I’m sure as hell ain’t tired yet
I want to change the world
But I ain’t getting out of bed
I gotta step outside but last_night
Is ringing in my ears
And running rings around me dear
Get a 9 to 5 and save for a rainy day
But I was stuck inside
When the summer came
And there was happiness
Shining through the window_pane
There’s warnings in the street
That the kids_ain’t doing_alright
Riots in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
It’s in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
Riots in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
It’s in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
Riots in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
It’s in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
Ah ain’t_doing alright
Ah ain’t_doing alright
Ah ain’t_doing alright
Ah ain’t_doing alright
Riots in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
It’s in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
Riots in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
It’s in the street
and the kids_ain’t doing_alright
If you hurt me, you won't be the first or the last
In a lifetime of many mistakes.
But I won't spend tomorrow regretting the past
For the chances that I didn't take.
'Cause I'll never know 'til it's over
If I'm right or I'm wrong loving you,
But I'd_rather be sorry for something I've_done
Than for something that I didn't do.
When you touch me it's easy to make me believe
Tomorrow won't take you away
But I'd gamble whatever tomorrow might bring
For the love that I'm living today.
And I'll never know 'til it's over
If I'm right or I'm wrong loving you,
But I'd_rather be sorry for something I've_done
Than for something that I didn't do.
Yes I'd_rather be sorry for something I've_done
Than for something that I didn't do.
Jack D, there's a seven
on the label
One glass on the living_room table
Phone face down, church up loud
Was tryna drown you out
tonight but
First sip,
I could feel you on my shoulder
The Tennessee heat had me
feelin' colder
Thought a drink would
get you off my mind
But this bottle_tastes like
865 (409-1021), yeah
One_last time, don't think_twice
Girl, just pick it up and
come over
Give the bedroom
door a little closure
I know I told you
I wouldn't_call and I tried
But this bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
This bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
You might think
I don't really want you with me
You might tell me to
empty out my whiskey
Or try changin' what I'm holdin'
in my hand
Try another liquor,
try another brand but
It don't matter if I got my lips
On a different drink
on a different night
Yeah, the second that
I take a sip all I'm gonna think is
This bottle_tastes like
865 (409-1021), yeah
One_last time, don't think_twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom
door a little closure
I know I told you
I wouldn't_call and I tried
But this bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
This bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
Thought a drink would
get you off my mind
I ain't sayin' I love you
but I might
'Cause this bottle_tastes like
865 (409-1021), yeah
One_last time don't think_twice
Girl, just pick it up
and come over
Give the bedroom
door a little closure
I know I told you
I wouldn't_call and I tried
But this bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
This bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
This bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
This bottle_tastes like
865_(409-1021)
Have you ever felt
The corners of your body
Curl up like paper in a fire?
And the bridges that
you never meant to burn
Leave you with nowhere else to hide
You've found you're feeling lost
There's_no comfort in the cross
When you're ticked off
With everything around you
Everything around you
And the years are passing
through my fingers
But nothing ever changes
Yeah this world moves fast
but I still linger
Caught in between
You've found you're feeling old,
Lost the laughter in your soul,
And you're ticked off
With everything around you
Everything around you
There are days that I wish I could stand
In someone_else's shoes
There are days that I wish
that I could color
In someone_else's hues
But there's_no use in thinking that;
You are you, and there's a fact
And this world would be a little_less
Without you here
So open up those doors
And run into
A world next_door to yours
Verse_1
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so_much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
Pre-Chorus
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner_or later, time's gonna take its toll
Chorus
They_say nothing_lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look_at my whole_life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
Verse_2
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
Pre-Chorus
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
Chorus
They_say nothing_lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look_at my whole_life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
Guitar Solo
Chorus
They_say nothing_lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll_be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
Outro
After all
I’ve_been lonely
The weather’s changed
You’ve been gone
But I still the feel the same
I missed your call
I miss your_face
You’re headed home
I’m counting down the days
And I know I don’t have to say it
But you know
that i’m gonna say it
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Kelsey_Ann
I’ll always love you
I made up my mind
What else could I do
Kelsey_Ann
I’ll Always love you
In the morning
When I wake
I hope I'm dreamin'
So I don't have to wait
To trace your mouth
With my lips
I lose myself
Every_time we kiss
And I know I don't have to say it
But you know that I'm gonna say it
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Kelsey_Ann
I’ll always love you
I'd give you the world
What else would I do
Kelsey_Ann
I'll always love you
Lost until we found
True love true love
Wherever we go
Whatever we do
Kelsey_Ann
I'll always love you
I made up my mind
What else could I do
Kelsey_Ann
I'll always love you
Wherever we go
Whatever we do
Kelsey_Ann
I'll always love you
I keep an extra towel
It's hung up by the door
I have another charger now
A toothbrush in the drawer
I set you a place
A table made for two
I'm living on a just in case
There's always room for you
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over the same_old story now
Is it so_much to ask
You to lay in the bed for a moment
Say it isn't a dream
Why can't you stay_here with me
Darling when you go
Does he know where you come
And how you let me hold you on
The dark sidе of the sun
Does he smеll my cologne
Mixed with your perfume
And does he know
you're late for work
Whenever I'm with you
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over the same_old story now
Is it so_much to ask
You to lay in the bed for a moment
Say it isn't a dream
Why can't you stay_here with me
Ooo-ooo-ooo ooo-ooo-ooo
ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo ooo-ooo-ooo
ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo ooo-ooo-ooo
ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
You go like the moon in the morning
Ooo-ooo-ooo ooo-ooo-ooo
ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
You go like the moon in the morning
You go like the moon in the morning
Hitch a ride on the breeze
See the light through the trees
Show's over the same_old story now
Some_people have their bucket list
Some_people just have dreams
I'm no exception to the rule it seems
I've watched the sunset at Uluru
Felt the lights on the big big stage
Walked by myself through Hollywood
And I've_seen a soul get saved
There_is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
First thing that I saw, when I came walking through that door
Once I was alone, but when I found you I found home
I've met some of my heroes
and I've got a few real good friends
I'm getting better at being okay with not knowing how this story ends
I've brought life into this world
and I have watched life go
I always say just what I need to say
So baby just in case you don't know
There_is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
First thing that I saw, when I came walking through that door
Once I was alone, but when I found you I found home
There_is so_much left to do, but it means nothing without you
I just want you always by my side
There_is nothing I could see that would make me more happy
than coming home, all alone, remembering you're mine
There_is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
First thing that I saw, when I came walking through that door
There_is nothing more beautiful than your smiling face
Nothing else will do, cause it means nothing without you
Once I was alone, but when I found you I found home
Da_da da_da da, da_da da_da da
Well I'm a crawling
king_snake babe
Crawl_up on your door

Crawl_up on your door
Crawling king_snake
And I wanna
I still remember the first_time we ever kissed
We didn't need no mistletoe to know what loving is
Through every up and down, there's one_thing that stays true
Christmas is better every second it's with you
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't got much to give
So I hope you think this is
[Chorus]
The perfect_gift that I could give
To the perfect_gift that ever lived
Yeah, this song's the second best that I could do
When the perfеct gift is you, you
When the perfеct gift is you, you
[Verse_2]
I can't pretend that this has been the perfect year
You held my hand through every tear
You were a home for me when I had no_one there
And I promise you that I'm not going anywhere
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't got much to give
So I hope you think this is
[Chorus]
The perfect_gift that I could give
To the perfect_gift that ever lived
Yeah, this song's the second best that I could do
When the perfect_gift is you, you
When the perfect_gift is you, you
[Bridge]
When seasons change and I've lost my way
It'll be okay with you by my side
And darlin', that's why
[Outro]
This song's the second best that I could do
When the perfect_gift is you, you
When the perfect_gift is you, you
When the perfect_gift is you, you
When the perfect_gift is you
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy
She said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty_face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come_back down to earth
Five years from now she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she_sees
Skater boy rocking MTV
She calls up her friends, they already_know
And they all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in a crowd
Looks at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy
She said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty_face see what he's worth
He wasn't good enough for her
He wasn't good enough for her
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck that she's mine now
'Cause we're more_than just good friends
And this is how the story ends
I'm just a boy, she's just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each_other's world
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
She's with the skater boy
Said, “See you later boy”
She's with the skater boy
Said, “See you later boy”
Verse_1
I was always searching for something to worsen that
Lying for affection, all for you to show you care
Pre-Chorus 1
I was done and infatuated
Well, I guess you drew me a kinda crazy
Chorus
Tell me what you're waiting_for
'Cause I was always waiting_for you
There's some things I can't ignore
Feels_like there's_nothing left to do
Verse_2
It_wasn't your intention, I can see it under you
Invite me to your house where you know what we're gonna do
Pre-Chorus 2
Oh, and you were done and intoxicated
When did life get so complicated
Chorus
Tell me what you'rе waiting_for
'Cause I was always waiting_for you
There's somе things I can't ignore
Feels_like there's_nothing left to do

Oh grits and glamor
I went to your wedding
Although I was dreading
The thought of losing you
The organ was playing
My poor heart kept saying
Your dreams, your dreams are through
You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness
I uttered a sigh
Whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness
Your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too
The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you
You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness
I uttered a sigh
Then whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness
Oh, your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too
The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you
Ooh_ooh
Ooh_ooh
Ooh_ooh
Ooh_ooh
Let me set the scene
Two lovers ripped right at the seams
They woke_up from the perfect dream
And then the darkness came
I signed the papers yesterday
You came and took your things away
I moved out of the home we made
And gave you back your name
What have we done
Did we fly too high
just to get burned by the sun
No_one's to blame
'Cause we called
all the angels to save us
Called them by name
But I guess they got lost
Star-crossed
Star-crossed star-crossed
star-crossed star-crossed
Star-crossed star-crossed
star-crossed star-crossed
Star-crossed star-crossed
star-crossed star-crossed
Star-crossed star-crossed
star-crossed star-crossed
Star-crossed ah
Ah star-crossed
Star-crossed ah
Star-crossed
Star-crossed
Star-crossed
Am I the stone in your pocket
That's weighing you down?
Or the face in your locket
That you wear all over town?
I'd be your silver lining
Not a cloud full_of rain
And the music would rise up
When I said your name
[Chorus]
If this was a movie I'd be_surprised
Hearing your car coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
If this was a movie
[Verse_2]
If this was a movie
Love would be enough
To save us from the darkness that's inside both of us
And we'd get away and we'd be okay
[Chorus]
If this was a movie I'd be_surprised
Hearing your car coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
But it's not a movie
Well, it is what it is, till it ain't, I guess
I try to learn from my mistakes but I ain't there yet
You never know when it's the last second chance you'll get
Should've have paid more attention all the times you said
Any_day now I'm gonna pack this truck up
You left my heart out in the rain to rust
Told me all the things that you had enough of
And I swore I was gonna change
Any_day now I'll make up for the heartache
Any_day now but you couldn't wait
Judging by the screen door slam two taillights fading outta town
Guess it's any_day now
The thing about time is it goes too fast
And the thing about love, it don't always last
And I can't right the wrong when you already left
Going_over and over all the times I said
Any_day now I'm gonna pack this truck up
You left my heart out in the rain to rust
Told you all the things that I had enough of
And you swore you were gonna change
Any_day now I'll make up for the heartache
Any_day now but I couldn't wait
Judging by the screen door slam two taillights fading outta town
Guess it's any_day now
It's any_day now
'Cause I wasn't done loving you
Now there's_nothing here left to prove
Have mercy on the man that didn't know then
You were all I had to lose
No I wasn't done loving you
So_many things I meant to do
I'm cold as the pillow by your empty nightstand
You're long gone now with my heart in your hand
Any_day now I'll make up for the heartache
Any_day now but you couldn't wait
Judging by the screen door slam two taillights fading outta town
Guess it's any_day now
It's too little, too_late for any_day now
It's any_day now
Verse_1
I'm not always strong but I got good posture
I stand up tall and push my shoulders back
Maybe we're all just good impostors
And when we're alone that's when we relax
I know I can be kinda rough on the outside
Act like I don't give a fuck when I do
But truth is I'm not really much of a tough guy
You probably already knew
Pre-Chorus
I think it's something that's deep down in me
And I just keep it inside
Chorus
I don't wanna cry in front_of you
I don't know what I am tryna prove
The weight of my cards on the table
Makes it unstable and rocks like a cradle
And baby, I don't wanna cry
Verse_2
Sometimes it feels_like a shock from a collar
And I'm just a dog roped up to a fence
I'm staying silent when I need to holler
Let down my guard and give up my defense
Pre-Chorus
I think it's something that's deep down in me
And I just keep it inside
Chorus
I don't wanna cry in front_of you
I don't know what I am tryna prove
The weight of my cards on the table
Makes it unstable and rocks like a cradle
And baby, I don't wanna cry in front_of you
I don't wanna cry in front_of you
Chorus
I don't wanna cry in front_of you
I don't know what I am tryna prove
The weight of my cards on the table
Makes it unstable and rocks like a cradle
And baby, I don't wanna cry in front_of you
I don't wanna cry in front_of you
I don't wanna cry in front_of you
[Verse_1]
I'm minding the flower
To make sure she blooms
I put water in her vase
And a little loving too
I put water in her vase
And a little loving too
I put water in her vase and
A little loving too
Cause you're not here
But I feel you everywhere
[Verse_2]
I washed all the dishes the pots and the pans
I scrapped and I scrubbed
Till I stopped thinking of you
I scrapped and I scrubbed
Till I stopped thinking of you
I scrapped and I scrubbed
Cause you're not here
But I feel you everywhere
[Outro]
Take you to the train station
Take you to the airport run
Leave my heart past
One clock is when you called my time
Wished you would've called sometime
But you sent Flowers down the line
But you sent Flowers down the line
It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away
And two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today
It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I'm going to hide my face
And about half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace
Chorus
Lord, how long have I got to keep on running
Seven hours, seven days or seven years
All I know is, since you've_been gone
Feel like I'm drowning in a river
Drowning_in a river of tears
Drowning_in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning_in a river
Verse_2
In three more days, I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace
A year from now,_maybe settle_down
Where no_one knows my face
I wish that I could hold you
One_more time to ease the pain
But my time's run out and I got to go
Got to run_away again
Chorus
Still I catch myself thinking
One_day I'll find my way back here
You'll save me from drowning
Drowning_in a river
Drowning_in a river of tears
Drowning_in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning_in a river
Lord, how long must it go on
Drowning
Drowning
Drowning_in a river of tears
I've heard you've_got a new job
Pays you six whole figures every month
I've heard you've gotten engaged
And that it had always been arranged
And it's_none of my_business I know
No it's_none of my_business
No it's_none of my_business I know
No it's_none of my_business
Your mother must be so proud
She had it all mapped out
And now you're playing by the rules
No you never used_to did you?
And it's_none of my_business I know
No it's_none of my_business
No it's_none of my_business I know
No it's_none of my_business
Well I thought you
wanted to be something more
Now you're wearing cashmere sweaters
and those plaid shorts
On the weekend you play golf
with your fathers friends
Oh do you enjoy it
or are you just playing pretend?
And do you miss the things you left behind?
Does she kiss you better_than I did?
Oh Ooo do you ever find somethings
just don't feel right?
But it's_none of my_business I know
No it's_none of my_business
No it's_none of my_business I know
No it's_none of my_business
But it's_none of my_business I know
It's none_of my_business
No it's_none of my_business I know
It's none_of my_business
Well I thought you
wanted to be something more
Now you're wearing cashmere sweaters
and those plaid shorts
Oh on the weekend you play golf
with your fathers friends
Oh do you enjoy it
or are you just playing pretend?
Do you enjoy it
or are you just playing pretend?
Do you enjoy it or are you just playing pretend?
I've lost all the words, feels_like my heart's been tied up
I wait 'til it hurts, I never can choose
Is it what I deserve? For spendin' the last of my love
On someone I knew that I'd always lose
[Pre-Chorus]
I stay, we'll burn
'Til you leave first
[Chorus]
So go
If you're_ready to go,_yeah, make your move, no, I won't follow
It's inevitable and we_both know that we're on borrowed time
How fast and far it flies
If you're_ready to go,_yeah, make your move, no, I won't follow
[Post-Chorus]
If you're_ready to go, if you're rеady to go
If you're_ready to go, if you're rеady to go
[Verse_2]
I can't look_at you or see past the ink on your_face
The smoke in the room is stinging my eyes
'Cause there's too_many memories gettin' the best of me
I loved you first but you'll be the first to leave
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay, we'll burn
'Til you leave first
[Chorus]
So go
If you're_ready to go,_yeah, make your move, no, I won't follow
It's inevitable and we_both know that we're on borrowed time
How fast and far it flies
If you're_ready to go,_yeah, make your move, no, I won't follow
[Post-Chorus]
If you're_ready to go, if you're_ready to go
If you're_ready to go, if you're_ready to go
If you're_ready to go,_yeah, make your move, no, I won't follow
If you're_ready to go, if you're_ready to go (Ah, ah)
[Outro]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(If_you're ready to go, if you're_ready to go)
(If_you're ready to go, if you're_ready to go)
(If_you're ready to go, if you're_ready to go)
(If_you're ready to go, if you're_ready to go)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Talk
Talk to me
All it takes is once
To look_at change
Is cutting you deep
Can’t you see?
It’s hard to know
But not to understand
To answer the thoughts
To accede your what-ifs
Please, see me
Talk to me once more
Talk to me
All it takes just once
To be estranged is cutting me deep
Would you see?
It’s hard to know
(Where have you been)
But not to understand
(I just wanna be seen)
To answer the thoughts
To accede your what-ifs
(Look into my eyes)
Please, see me
And talk to me once more
Talk
Talk to me
All it takes is once
Wake me up when the season's gone
'Cause I've_wasted
all my dawns on you
So what do I do?
Oh, what I do?
I get fucked up just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug
I have grown a victim to
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?
All is fair in love and war
So what the hell are
we even fighting for
I'm on your front porch
begging for my dawns back
Give my goddamn records
and my clothes back
'Cause I'm through
Oh, I am through
And by the time she wakes,
I’ll be halfway to mama's home
It just dawned on me,
life is as fleeting the passing dawn
And it was my mistake
'cause she never said
a thing about Jesus
I miss my mother's southern
drawl and her praying through
the walls in the evening
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies
makes it way back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Give me my dawns back
'Cause everything that dies
makes it way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Wake me up
when the season's gone
'Cause I've_wasted
all my dawns on you
So what do I do?
Oh, what I do?
And by the time he wakes
I’ll be half way to
my best friends home
It just dawned on me,
life is as fleeting
as the passing dawn
I should have told him twice
I believe in something
bigger_than both of us
I miss going to out to bars
shooting stars not worrying
about whats left of us
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies
makes it way back
I lost her last July
in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Give me my dawns back
'Cause everything that dies
makes it way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory
I get fucked up just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug
I have grown a victim to
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?
On my Fridays when it's whiskey, I go back to Cincy
That Ohio night you tricked me into buyin' all your shots
Got your ghost up in my Chevy, shotgun lookin' ready
For them parties where you'd let me spin you 'round and show you off
I been tryin' to get away_from you for a while now
But there_ain't no settin' you down
[Chorus]
You're my sunrise, you keep_comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter_how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, loved me 'til thе daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep_comin' up, you keep_comin' up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep_comin'
[Verse_2]
Comin' up at 8 A.M., 9 A.M.
All thе way to 10 P.M. when my day ends
Layin' down and there you are in my Amens
Mornin' light and you're there on my mind again
[Chorus]
You're my sunrise, you keep_comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter_how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, loved me 'til the daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep_comin' up
Yeah, you keep_comin' up, up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep_comin'
Yeah, you keep_comin' up, up
You keep comin', you keep_comin'
[Bridge]
There_ain't no blinds to close, covers to throw over my head
Ever_since you left
[Chorus]
You're my sunrise, you keep_comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter_how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, loved me 'til the daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep_comin' up
Yeah, you keep_comin' up, up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep_comin'
Yeah, you keep_comin' up
Wanna ride with you 'til the wheels fall off
'Til we're running out of road
Wanna dance with you 'til the music stops
'Til we got no place to go
[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Everybody needs a place to hide
This don't have to be a bumpy ride
I think we should be alone tonight
'Cause we don't have to be lonely
Everybody needs some company
Let's talk_about it over one_more drink
I think you should be alone with me
'Cause we don't have to be lonely
[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Don't have to be lonely
Lonely
Don't have to be lonely, lonely
Don't have to be lonely
Don't have to be lonely
[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Wanna ride with you 'til the world stands still
Like there's_no one_else but us
Wanna dance with you 'til we can't stand up
'Til we_both give in to love
[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Everybody needs a place to hide
This don't have to be a bumpy ride
I think we should be alone tonight
'Cause we don't have to be lonely
Everybody needs some company
Let's talk_about it over one_more drink
I think you should be alone with me
'Cause we don't have to be lonely
[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Don't have to be lonely
Don't have to be lonely
Don't have to be lonely
Don't have to be
Don't have to be lonely
[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Wanna ride with you 'til the wheels fall off
'Til we're running out of road
Look_at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
[Chorus]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so
[Verse_2]
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
[Chorus]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I'd bleed myself dry
You know I'd bleed myself dry
[Bridge]
It's_true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine
[Outro]
Look_at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do
Oh I'll_pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll_pawn you my gold wedding_ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again
Darling, how could I stay_here without you
I have nothing to ease my poor heart
This old world would seem sad, love, without you
Tell me now that we never will part
Oh I'll_pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll_pawn you my gold wedding_ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again
Take back all the gifts you have given
A diamond ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
It's a face that is false but is fair
Oh I'll_pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll_pawn you my gold wedding_ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again
Oh, the white rose that blooms in the garden
It grows with the love of my heart
It broke through on the day that I met you
It will die on the day that we part
Oh I'll_pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll_pawn you my gold wedding_ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again
"I hear songs on the radio
They_might be fast or they might be slow
But every song they play's got me thinkin'_'bout you
I see a fella walkin' down the street
He looks at me and he smiles real sweet
But he don't matter to me
'Cause I'm thinkin'_'bout you
Every_little dream I dream about you
Every_little thought I think_about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild_horse I want to break you
I love you so_much I hate you
Every_little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone
My tongue gets tied when I try to talk
My knees get weak when I start to walk
So I might as well stay home and keep thinkin'_'bout you
""the young and the restless"" on my tv set
That's_just like us when we first met
And when they start to kissin'
Got me thinking bout you
Every_little dream I dream about you
Every_little thought I think_about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild_horse I want to break you
I love you so_much I hate you
Every_little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone
Every_little dream I dream about you
Every_little thought I think_about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild_horse I want to break you
I love you so_much I hate you
Every_little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone
"
You can throw away my picture, empty out my dresser drawer
Break up all the dishes, change the lock on the door
But you cant erase my memory, no matter_how you try
It dont mean its over, just because you said goodbye
I'm sorry that I hurt you, but you made me so mad
If I dont care about you, why do I feel so_bad
We're almost out of sugar, and our matches got wet
But we ain't out of love yet
We ain't out of love yet lets not do something hasty,baby,that we'll regret
Our lovin cup aint empty, there's still plenty left
We aint out of love yet
We might run out of gas and be left out in the rain
Could run out of ciggarettes or money again
A little out of touch or just plain out of our heads
But we aint out of love yet
We aint out of love yet
Lets not do something hasty, baby, that we'll regret
Our lovin cup aint empty theres still plenty left
We aint out of love yet
And with just a little mending we can have a happy ending
Lets forgive and forget
We dont_need a lawyer now we just need a rest
Then we can ge back into doin' what we do best
Was scarlett ever through with rhett
You cant break up a perfect set
And we aint out of love yet
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The_answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
She_said it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
She_said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways
She_said why don't we_both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waitin' for a man, a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight
They used_to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Lovin' the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin'
And bring it on back to you
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away
Bayou Sam from South Louisian'
Had gamblin' in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly goin' insane
High on the top of a Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin'
She watched that Queen go under
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away
Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
seekin' my fame and fortune
lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi_again
I came in on a Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months_or more
Ran out of time and money
It looks like they took my friends
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi_again
Well The man from the magazine
He said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection and
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town on a one-night stand
Looks_like my plans fell through
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi_again
If I only had a dollar
For every song I've sung
And every_time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi_again
Oh, Lord, Stuck in Lodi_again
Oh lord stuck in Lodi_again

Rain rain, go away, come again some other day.

I'll be the one who's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong
Maybe I'll do things right

You'll learn to cry like me
Baby let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right
You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees

I used_to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone and a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, i was so far gone
Crying all my tears with the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me
Chorus:
Oh watch me go
I'm the happy girl, everybody_knows
That the sweetest thing that you've ever seen
In the whole wide world is a happy girl
I used_to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside, feeling so left out
Standing in the corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile and my lighted fuse
Now every_time i start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat
Chorus
Laugh when i feel like it
Cry when i feel like it
That's_just how my life is
That's how it goes
Oh watch me go
I'm the happy girl and i've come to know
That the world won't change just 'cause i complain
Let the axis twirl i'm the happy girl
Oh yeah,_yeah, yeah,_yeah i'm the happy girl
Oh yeah,_yeah, yeah,_yeah i'm the happy girl
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a fish on a hook
Like a knight
in some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
And if I if I have been unkind
I just hope you will let it go by
And if I if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you
Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone
who reached out to me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to be
I saw a young man
leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to me
Don't ask for so_much
And a young woman
leaning in her darkened door
She cried out to me
Why not ask for more
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Let's go!
Don't wantcha for the weekend, don't wantcha for a night
I'm only interested if I can have you for life, yeah

Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk
with you again
Because a vision
softly creeping
left it's seeds while
I was sleeping
And the vision
that was planted in my_brain
still_remains
within the sound of silence
In_restless dreams
I walked alone
narrow streets
of cobblestone
'Neath the halo
of a street lamp
I turned my collar
to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
by the flash of
a neon_light
that split the night
and touched the sound
of silence
And in the naked light I saw
ten_thousand
people maybe more
People talking
without speaking
people hearing
without listening
people writing songs
that voices never share
And no_one dare
disturb the sound of silence
Fools said I You do not know
silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that
I might teach you
Take my arms that
I might reach you
But my words
like silent raindrops fell
and echoed
in the wells of silence
And the people
bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
And the sign
flashed out it's warning
in the words
that it was forming
And the sign said The
words of the prophets are
written on the subway walls
and tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds
of silence
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses
When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning
I feel the trembling tingle of a sleepless_night
Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright
Beams of blue come flickering through my window_pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame
And I wonder_if you know
That I never_understood
That_although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would
Moonlight used_to bathe the contours of your_face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
And the fragrance of your flowers rest beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead
And I wonder_if you know
That I never_understood
That_although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would
Never_thought the words you said were true
Never_thought you said just what you meant
Never_knew how_much I needed you
Never_thought you'd leave, until you went
Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs
And I wonder_if you know
That I never_understood
That_although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would
She's fifteen and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the keys to her heart
It's just matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly:
two sparrows in a hurri-cane
Trying to find their way
With a head full_of dreams
and faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will
There's a baby crying and one_more on the way
There's a wolf at the door with a big stack of bills
They can't pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other_side
go to She's eighty-three and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the key to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly
go to
2 2:
Like two sparrows in a hurri-cane
Trying to find their way
With a head full_of dreams
and faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will
Leaving On A Jet Plane
제트기를_타고 떠나는 것
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go,
짐은 다 쌌어, 갈 준비가 됐어
I'm standing here outside your door,
너의 문 앞에 서 있어
I hate to wake you up to say good-bye.
안녕이란 말을 하기 위해 널 깨우는 건 싫지만
But the dawn is breakin',
이제 동이 트는걸
It's early morn,
이른 아침인걸
The taxi's waitin'
택시가 기다려
He's blowin' his horn,
빵빵거리고 있어
Already I'm so_lonesome I could die.
난 벌써부터 너무 외로워서 죽어버릴 것만 같아

Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
아, (베이비) 정말 가기_싫어
There's so_many times I've let you down
널 실망시킨 적이 너무 많았지
So_many times I've played around,
장난친 적도 너무 많고
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
있잖아, 전부 아무 뜻도 아니었어
Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you,
가는 곳마다 널 생각할게
Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you,
부르는 노래마다 널 위해 부를게
When I come_back I'll bring your wedding ring.
돌아올 때는 네 결혼반지를 가져올게
So kiss me and smile for me,
그러니 키스하고 날_위해 웃어줘
Tell me that you'll_wait for me,
날_기다리겠다고 해줘

아, (베이비), 가기_싫어
Now the time has come to leave you,
이제 널 떠날 시간이 왔어
One_more time let me kiss you,
한 번만 더 키스하게 해줘
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way.
그런 후에 넌 눈을 감아, 난 갈게
Dream about the days to come
앞으로 올 날들을 꿈꿔
When I won't have to leave alone,
내가 혼자 떠나지 않아도 되지 않을 때를
About the times I won't have to say:
이런 말을 하지 않아도 되는 때를
Kiss me and smile for me.
키스해줘, 날_위해 웃어줘
Tell me that you'll_wait for me,
날_기다리겠다고 말해줘

You will know that I am gone.
내가 가버린걸 알게 되겠죠.
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.
100마일 밖에서 불어대는 기적소리를 들으면서
A hundred_miles, a hundred_miles
100마일, 100마일,
a hundred_miles, a hundred_miles
그위에 100마일, 100마일
You can hear the whistle blow, a hundred miles.
100마일 밖에서 기적소리를 들으시겠죠
Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three
신이여, 난 100마일, 200마일, 300마일
Lord I'm four, Lord I'm five_hundred miles from my home.
400마일, 500마일 집에서 떨어져 있는데
Five hundred_miles, five_hundred miles,
500마일, 500마일
Five hundred_miles, five_hundred miles,
500마일, 500마일
Lord I'm five_hundred miles from my home.
난 집에서 500 마일 떨어진 곳에 와 있는거에요.
Not a shirt on my back
입을 셔츠 한 장 없고
Not a penny to my name.
동전 하나 내겐 없고
Lord I can't go home this away.
신이여 나 이런식으론 집에 못가요
This away, this away, this away, this away
이런식으로, 이런식으론 갈수 없네
Lord I can't go home this away.
난 집에 갈 수 없어요
If you miss the train I'm on
내가 탄 기차를 놓치신다면
You will know that I am gone.
내가 가버린걸 알수 있겠죠
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred_miles
100마일 밖에서도 들리는 휘파람 소리가 들릴꺼에요
It ain't_no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
It don't matter, anyhow.
And it ain't_no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
If you don't know by now.
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Look_out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travelin' on,
Don't think_twice it's all right.
It ain't_no use in turnin' on your light, babe,
Light I never know'd
It ain't_no use in turnin' on your light, babe,
I'm on the dark_side of the road.
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
We never did too_much talkin' anyway,
Don't think_twice it's all right.
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a word gal,
So I'll just say "fair-thee-well"
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
You could uh done better, but I don't mind
You just sorta wasted my precious time,
Don't think_twice it's all right.
It ain't_no use in callin' out my name gal,
Like you never did_before
It ain't_no use in callin' out my name gal,
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm a thinkin' and a wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told,
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul,
Don't think_twice it's all right.
Where do you go after midnight
When all the doors should be closed
Your alibis just don't sound right
I asked but nobody knows
How can you look me in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With those true lies
Someone's been sleepin' in my bed
This room don't smell like you and me
Who's that been sneakin' out the window
Do you think I'm too blind to see
When you look me in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With those true lies
It_was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your true lies
You been doin' this so long now
You're thinkin' it's the truth
I guess it don't seem wrong if it
Ain't bein' done to you
Gotta lot to learn, baby
You can't keep it down
Word gets in the wind
Then it's bound to blow back around
Girl, can you give me a reason
Bet you don't even know why
Can't figure_out what you're thinkin'
Or what it is you're tryin' to justify
When you look me in the eyes
Nd make it sound so very nice
With your true lies
It_was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your true lies
You can laugh, you can cry
But, girl, I just can't buy
Those true lies
I was_born 3 months too early
The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must have had my
mama's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin
Even_if this love's to die for
Cuz your bags are packed
And I ain't cryin
Your walkin out and I'm not tryin
To change your mind
Cuz I was_born to be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom
Who works 2 jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands
And the heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
I don't believe in self pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken_hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I wanna be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom
Who works 2 jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands
And the heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
Oh a single mom
Who works 2 jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands
And the heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
But I must have had my mama's will
And God's amazing grace
I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor
Just look_at you sitting there
You never looked better_than tonight
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'd stay
Like I've_done so_many times
I was so sure this would be the night
You'd close the door and want to stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'll stay
Like I've_done so_many times
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every_time
Oh, put out the light
Just hold on
Before we say_goodbye
Now it's mornin' and the phone rings
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before ya change your mind
And if ya knew what I was thinkin', girl
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one_more time
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every_time
Oh, put out the light
Just hold on
Before we say_goodbye
Before we say_goodbye
Goodbye
In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot, on a barstool she took off
her ring.
I thought_I'd get closer, so I walked on over, I sat down and asked her
the name.
When the drinks fin'lly hit her, she said "I'm no quitter, but I fin'lly
quit living on dreams.
I'm hungry for laughter, and, here ever after, I'm after whatever the
other life brings.
In the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him, I thought how he
looked out of place.
He came to the women who sat there beside me, he had a strange look on
his face.
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain, for a minute I
thought I was dead.
But he started shakin', his big heart was breakin', he turned to the
woman and said:
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille,
with four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times, but this time
your hurting won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille!
After he left us, I ordered more whiskey, I thought how she'd made him
look small!
From the lights of the barroom to a rented hotel room, we walked without
talking at all.
She was a beauty, but when she came to me, she must have thought_I'd
lost my mind.
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her kept coming back
time after time.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille... (twice
I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire, I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more_than want you, and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
And I need you more_than want you,
and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
Baby, when i met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that i can't explain
Hold me closer and i feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Chorus:
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely_on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
I can't live_without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no_one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly loosen' sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no_doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, i will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Repeat chorus
Tag:
Sail away
Oh, come sail_away with me
Repeat chorus
Fade:
Repeat chorus
I knew a man
He was a real go getter
What he did to climb
The ladder of success
And how far he went
Was how he measured
The worth of his life
And who he was
But that's all behind me now because
Loving you
It's what I do
It's the only thing I've found I can put my heart into
It's who I am
I'm a lucky man
Living the life I choose
Loving you
It's what I do
I do what I can
To make an honest living
But it's just a job it's not
What I am living for
I want to earn
The love you're giving
That's all that matters now to me
And no matter_what I'll always be
Loving you
It's what I do
It's the only thing I've found I can put my heart into
It's who I am
I'm a lucky man
Living the life I choose
Loving you
It's what I do
"When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, to see you again
Winter,_spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've_got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full_of clouds
And that old north_wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out_loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter,_spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there yes I will
Ain't it good to know that you've_got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, desert you
And take your soul if you let them, don't you let_them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running running running to see you again
Winter,_spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend
Ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know
You've_got a friend
You've_got a friend
"
People say I'm no good
Crazy as a loon
Cause I get stoned in the morning
And get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't_no money
But I damn sure got it made
Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country_boy alone
Preacher man talking on T.V.
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
Cause hes worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water
And I know that its true
But some times I think that preacherman
Would like to do a little walking too
But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Ya just leave this long haired country_boy alone
A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants a vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke
But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Ya just leave this long haired country_boy alone

Written By DANIELS, CHARLES EDWARD
Jolene,_Jolene, Jolene,_Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene,_Jolene, Jolene,_Jolene
Please_don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete_with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's_nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he_calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene,_Jolene, Jolene,_Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene,_Jolene, Jolene,_Jolene
Please_don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Jolene,_Jolene, Jolene,_Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene,_Jolene, Jolene,_Jolene
Please_don't take him even_though you can
Jolene,_Jolene
A white sports coat and a pink_carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sports coat and a pink_carnation
I'm all alone in romance
Once you told me long_ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind, it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams
A white sports coat and a pink_carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood
I'm all dressed up for the dance
I'm all alone in romance
Once you told me long_ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams
A white sports coat and a pink_carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood
Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blowin´ through the grass
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends
Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting_for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends
Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy
Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears
Time it was and what a time it was.
It_was a time of innocence.
A time of confidences.
Long ago it must be,
I have a photograph,
Preserve your memories,
They're all that's left you
I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
And without your sweet love what would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me, you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
And without your sweet love what would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me, you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Hallelujah!
Go_tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go_tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born
Down in a lonely manger
The humble Christ was_born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn
Hallelujah!
Go_tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go_tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds kept their watch
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shown a holy light
Hallelujah!
Go_tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go_tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born
Down in a lonely manger
The humble Christ was_born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn
Hallelujah!
Go_tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go_tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born
Any_day now
I will hear you say
Goodbye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
you will have flown, woah
Any_day now, I'll be all alone
whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Any_day now
when your restless eyes
meet someone_new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows
will fall all over town, woah
Any_day now any_day now
Love will let me down any_day now
whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay-ay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holdin' on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any_day now
when the clock strikes Go?
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then my wild beautiful bird
you will have flown, woah
Any_day now any_day now
Love will let me down any_day now
'cause you won't be around
Then the blue shadows will fall
all over town, woah
Any_day now any_day now
Love will let me down any_day now
'cause you won't be around
Any_day now
you won't be around
Ooo-ooo-oo
Any_day now
No no no no no no
You won't be around
Any_day now
One hour and I'll be meeting you
I know you're gonna make me blue
My heart is trembling through and through
'Cause I know very well, I can tell, I can tell
This will be my last date with you
Just can't believe that this could end
I know, I'll never love again
You'll ask me to be just a friend
It's as plain as can be, I can see, I can see
This will be my last date with you
I know we had a quarrel
But all sweethearts do
I gave my heart to prove to you
That I would always love you and be true
I know you've met somebody new
You'll tell me, you and I are through
My plans and dreams cannot come_true
And when you say goodby, I know I will cry
'Cause I know it's my last date with you
He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny_how those memories they last
Like strawberry_wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry_wine
I still remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted_away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come_back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry_wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry_wine
The fields have grown over now
Years since they've_seen the plow
There's_nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've_been missing so_much
Like strawberry_wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry_wine
I just thought, that you would like to know
That I would, do anything, just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams come_true
Well I just thought, that you would like to know, that I... I would climb the highest tree
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams, come_true
I know, that it seems like, I am full_of hot air
But my heart is in the right place
I swear, I swear
I just thought that you, would like to know, that I... I would do_anything
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams come_true
Now I know that it seems like, I'm full_of hot air
But my heart
My heart is in the right place
I swear, I swear
And I just thought that you, would like to know
That I...I'd do anything...anything, just to make your dreams
Just to make your dreams come_true
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams...
Come true
The only thing I see ahead
Is just the heat rising off the road.
The rainbows I've_been chasing keep
On fading 'fore I find my pot of gold.
And more and more I'm thinking that
The only treasures that I'll ever know
Are long_ago and far behind
Wrapped up in my memories of home.
Home was a swimming hole
And a fishing pole
And the feel of a muddy road
Between my toes.
Home was a back porch swing
Where I would sit
And mama'd sing 'Amazing Grace'
While she hung out the clothes.
Home was an easy chair
With my daddy there
And the smell of
Sunday supper on the stove.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.
Now the miles I put behind me
Ain't as hard as the miles
That lay ahead.
It's way too_late to listen
To the words of wisdom
That my daddy said.
The straight and narrow path
He showed me
Turned into a thousand winding roads.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.
Home was a swimming hole
And a fishing pole
And the feel of a muddy road
Between my toes.
Home was a back porch swing
Where I would sit
And mama'd sing 'Amazing Grace'
While she hung out the clothes.
Home was an easy chair
With my daddy there
And the smell of
Sunday supper on the stove.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.
The straight and narrow path
He showed me
Turned into a thousand winding roads.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.
Leaving On A Jet Plane
제트기를_타고 떠나는 것
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go,
짐은 다 쌌어, 갈 준비가 됐어
I'm standing here outside your door,
너의 문 앞에 서 있어
I hate to wake you up to say good-bye.
안녕이란 말을 하기 위해 널 깨우는 건 싫지만
But the dawn is breakin',
이제 동이 트는걸
It's early morn,
이른 아침인걸
The taxi's waitin'
택시가 기다려
He's blowin' his horn,
빵빵거리고 있어
Already I'm so_lonesome I could die.
난 벌써부터 너무 외로워서 죽어버릴 것만 같아
So kiss me and smile for me,
그러니 키스해줘, 날_위해 웃어줘
Tell me that you'll_wait for me,
날_기다리겠다고 말해줘
Hold me like you'll_never let me go.
절대로 놓지_않을 것처럼_안아줘
'Cause I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane,
난 제트기를_타고 떠날 거니까
Don't know when I'll be back again,
언제 돌아올지도 몰라
Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
아, (베이비) 정말 가기_싫어
There's so_many times I've let you down
널 실망시킨 적이 너무 많았지
So_many times I've played around,
장난친 적도 너무 많고
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
있잖아, 전부 아무 뜻도 아니었어
Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you,
가는 곳마다 널 생각할게
Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you,
부르는 노래마다 널 위해 부를게
When I come_back I'll bring your wedding ring.
돌아올 때는 네 결혼반지를 가져올게
So kiss me and smile for me,
그러니 키스하고 날_위해 웃어줘
Tell me that you'll_wait for me,
날_기다리겠다고 해줘
Hold me like you'll_never let me go.
절대로 놓지_않을 것처럼_안아줘
'Cause I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane,
제트기를_타고 떠날 거니까
Don't know when I'll be back again,
언제_올지도 모르니까
Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
아, (베이비), 가기_싫어
Now the time has come to leave you,
이제 널 떠날 시간이 왔어
One_more time let me kiss you,
한 번만 더 키스하게 해줘
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way.
그런 후에 넌 눈을 감아, 난 갈게
Dream about the days to come
앞으로 올 날들을 꿈꿔
When I won't have to leave alone,
내가 혼자 떠나지 않아도 되지 않을 때를
About the times I won't have to say:
이런 말을 하지 않아도 되는 때를
Kiss me and smile for me.
키스해줘, 날_위해 웃어줘
Tell me that you'll_wait for me,
날_기다리겠다고 말해줘
Hold me like you'll_never let me go.
절대 놓지_않을 것처럼_안아줘
'Cause I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane,
제트기를_타고 떠나니까
Don't know when I'll be back again,
언제_올지도 모르니까
Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
오, (베이비) 가기_싫어
I'm_leavin' on a jet_plane,
제트기를_타고 떠나니까
Don't know when I'll be back again,
언제_올지도 모르니까
Oh,_babe, I hate to go.
오, (베이비) 가기_싫어
Dream, are you a dreamer?
Are you a dreamer?
Do you dream?
Sleep, are you a sleeper?
Are you a sleeper?
Do you sleep?
When your brown_eyes close
Do blue_skies open up?
When your breathing slows
Your mind run fast and free?
Will you sleep and dream with me?
Love, are you my lover?
Are you my lover?
Do you love me?
Save, are you a savior?
Are you a savior?
Will you save?
When my blue eyes close
Will white clouds lift me up?
When my body slows
My mind run fast and free?
Do you hold me when I sleep?
Do you hold me when I sleep?
When your brown_eyes close
Do blue_skies open up?
When your breathing slows
Your mind run fast and free?
Will you sleep and dream with me?
Will you sleep and dream with me?
Water, I?m walking on water
Walking on water for you.
"You know I'd fall_apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
Cause everything that
don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green

Wanna hold you hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you

But your beauty's
deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you
what I see tonight
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your_lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold you hand forever
Never let you forget it
Cause baby I wanna make
you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel

Better than your fairy_tales
Better than your best dreams

"
I had shards of a devilish mind
when I saw the golddust in your
three coloured eyes
I start leaving loneliness
in the wild
And all the
devilish thoughts behind
There are something
you can't see when you're in love
And I'm thankful for the fear
that I got taught
Well I don't know what I'm doing
in the future blud
But I suppose
I'm gonna do it for you
I don't want a lie girl
so drop me if you don't
But if you love me
you won't see me go
I don't want a lie
so drop me if you don't
But if you love me
you won't see me go
I need company sometimes
Did you find
the common wrong of right
Could you command a soldierman
to leave is best_friend behind
Could you kill a man to save a life
There are somethings
you can't see
when you're in love
And I'm thankful for the fear
that I got taught
Well I don't know
what I'm doing in the future blue
But I suppose
I'm gonna do it for you
I don't want a lie girl
so drop me if you don't
But if you love me
you won't see me go
I don't want a lie
so drop me if you don't
But if you love me
you won't see me go
I don't want a lie
so drop me if you don't
But if you love me
if you love me
you won't see me go
You say it's over
and you're_ready to move on
You want to believe
all the fire is gone
But I feel some hesitation
even as you leave
Think it through
what you gonna do about me
It hasn't always been easy
you and I both know
But the easy way out
will be a hot way to go
Do you think you can forget
what we had so easily
Think it through
what you gonna do about me
You may go out
and find another
but what you think you
lookin for
You might think you
found a lover
but you'll still be wanting
something more
When you close your eyes
you might be_surprised
at who you're gonna see
Oh baby
what you gonna do about me
So stop and think it over baby
before you leave it all behind
No_matter where you go
no matter_what you do
I'll still be there
in my back of the line
When you close your eyes
you might be_surprised
at who you gonna see
Oh baby
what you gonna do about me
You might spend a lifetime
fighting back my memory
Now oh baby
what you gonna do about me
Oh I want you to think it through
What you gonna do
what you gonna do about me
I don't want to talk right_now
I just want your arms wrapped
around
Me in this_moment
Before it runs out
Oh don't say that it's over
Oh no say it ain't so
Let's let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don't_care
For all that we've got don't
let go
Just hold me
I can't pull you closer than this
It's just you and the moon on
my skin
Oh who says it ever has to end
Oh don't say that it's over
Oh no say it ain't so
Let's let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don't_care
For all that we've got don't
let go
Let's let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I don't_care
For all that we've got don't
let go
Just hold
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your
destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Dolores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your
destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
I know a woman
Became a wife
These_are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She_said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She_said a bad day's when I lie
in bed
And think of things that might
have been
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your
destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the
reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay
sleeping
Then he turned around and headed
home again
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your
destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We're working our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the
highway
When in fact we're slip_slidin'
away
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your
destination
The more you're_slip slidin'_away
Slip_slidin' away
Slip_slidin' away
You know the nearer_your

Mmm

merry_little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
our troubles will be out of sight
Have_yourself a
merry_little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on
our troubles will be miles_away
Hear we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years

If the fates allow
Hang a shining star
upon the highest bough
And have yourself
a merry_little Christmas now
Everybody says you're amazing
Tell me what I don't know and
What I love about you is you're real
Everyday I think that I'm dreaming
Where_did all the rain go
And its taking me awhile to see what's real
I had my head down
But when you came around
I knew there was life ahead
Beyond what's in front_of me
Hey now
Thought I had it all figured_out
But honey, you caught me off guard
And I had all these walls
Ready to push you out
But honey, you caught me
Caught me off guard
I never needed a rescue
Not a dame in distress
'cause all I want is a love I can see-through
Sweet-nothings are nothing
When there's absolutely nothing
For me to hold on to
I had my head down
But when you came around
I knew there was life ahead
Beyond what's in front_of me
I'm tired_of pretending
I'm slowly comprehending

The lighting strikes and the rain falls too
So let it fall, let our worries wash_away
Let it roll down our windows, all wrapped up we'll stay
Lady, we can lay here and be lazy
Let it all go, I'll be a pillow, slide just a little closer, let me warm you up
Darling, drown in a river that you're caught in
I wanna get lost in your silhouette, and don't forget that red, wet kiss on my lips

From your long brown hair to your curled up toes
Pull you in, keep you close

You say that you’re watching the birds out the window
Well I’ve got a bird you can watch
You ain’t gotta act_like you’re borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
What’s it to you if it’s Wednesday at noon
and I’ve traded my iced_tea for scotch
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
You ain’t gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwear’s on the line
It ain’t mine
I ain’t gonna ask whose been mowing your grass
So you ain’t gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your many blinds
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
Don’t ask me if I go to church
I won’t ask if your husband’s still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street
So keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
The full moon
Is shining like a spotlight
I could just sit and listen to
you talkin' all night
When you whisper
Yeah baby when you lean in
I get a crazy crazy good kind
of feelin'
It's like Amen from the back of
the choir
Sweet home of freedom underneath
the tires
Kicked back sittin' by a
cracklin' fire
Strumming them guitar strings
And like an_old song on the radio
That you grew_up to and
everybody_knows
Rushin' of the water when the
river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me
Mm m mm like a melody
Baby you sound good to me
Tell me
All of your stories
And don't you leave nothin' out
'cause baby I ain't in a hurry
Every_little thing you say
Got a real nice ring to it
The way it rolls off your_lips
And oh when you give me that kiss
It's like Amen from the back of
the choir
Sweet home of freedom underneath
the tires
Kicked back sittin' by a
cracklin' fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an_old song on the radio
That you grew_up to and
everybody_knows
Rushin' of the water when the
river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me
Mm m mm like a melody
Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me
Mm m mm like a melody
Baby mm_mm
Like an Amen from the back of
the choir
Sweet home of freedom underneath
the tires
Kicked back sittin' by a

Strumming them guitar strings
Like an_old song on the radio
That you grew_up to and

Rushin' of the water when the

Winding wild and free

Sayin' it's time
And don't you just wish we could just stay right_here together
All day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime
If we crawl back into bed
Got as close as we could get
Tryin' to figure_out where this thing is goin'
Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leavin
Why don't you just stay a little_bit longer
Got it goin on
And I just can't believe it
This feelin' it just keeps gettin' stronger
If ya gotta go
You gotta know
I might go crazy
Here without you baby
We're livin' every kiss
You ain't leavin me like this

To lite another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burnin' this mornin

You tried so try again
You never know
You've cried you'll cry again
You bare your soul
No one understands

You're not the only one
who seems alone
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's_nearly morning
Any_second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's_nearly morning
Any_second now
It hurts it really hurts
It's in your blood
To give yourself away
For nothing much
When no_one understand
you're breaking ground
You're not the only one
who can't be found
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's_nearly morning
Any_second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's_nearly morning
Any_second now
Any_second now
Any_second now
As sure as the night
will cover your eyes
As sure as the voice
thats telling you lies
Counting the days
that never arrive
Any_second now
As sure as the stones
that slow your feet down
As sure as the circles
turning you round
As sure as the peace
that never got found
Any_second now
All of the time
you thought you got close
How hard it is to love
those old ghosts
You get the least
but you give up the most
Any_second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's_nearly morning
Any_second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's_nearly morning
Any_second now
We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's_nearly morning
The sandman told me he's done all he can
The situation calls for more_than sand
You've_been crying all night long
Tossing and turning and it's almost done.
I am here, I'm gonna help you sleep
Count on me instead of counting sheet
Close your eyes and leave the rest to me.
And you'll have sweet dreams at the last of night
And easy feeling and a morning_light
Drift away with a touch of the hand
From the sleep tight, goodnight man.
Soft and sooth and as a lullaby
I'll kiss your tears from those weary eyes
And in the morning you will understand
That you've_been touched by the goodnight man.
I'll rock you gently like a rolling wave
Hold you in my arms until you drift away
So just lay back and leave the rest to me.
And you'll have sweet dreams at the last of night
And easy feeling and a morning_light
Drift away with a touch of the hand
From the sleep tight, goodnight man.
It_was an April night and I was driving
Went out on the town
The show was at the palace
So we all went on down
We all had a bomb as I recall
But now it seems absurd
As the madness raged upon the stage
He didn't say a word
He was a little weak and we all fear
It_wasn't one of us
He didn't drink, he didn't smoke
And he didn't [Incomprehensible]
You'd see him now and then
With a bunch of men hanging around the sea
And I'm sure I would have liked him more
If he were a little more like me
It_was a spring each day
The clouds were gray
Looked like in my dream
Thought about the night before
And I was so ashamed
When I heard what they had done to him
Stranger I had known
But as drunk as we all got last_night
It's a wonder we got home
He was a little weak and we all fear
It_wasn't one of us
He didn't drink, he didn't smoke
And he didn't [Incomprehensible]
You'd see him now and then
With a bunch of men hanging around the sea
And I'm sure I would have liked him more
If he were a little more like me
And I'm sure I would have liked him more
If he were a little more like me
Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood
Chorus
There_is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There_is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Would you be free from your passion and pride
Theres power in the blood, power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to Calvarys tide
There's wonderful power in the blood
Chorus
(during music) Would you be whiter,
much whiter than snow?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow
There's wonderful power in the blood
Chorus Two Times
I miss you more_than you could know
I watch the grass on the back lawn grow
And I will not allow winds of change to blow
And I hope you decide to come_back home
Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
Cause I've_been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love
You reach out for me in the night
And an errant finger pokes me in the eye
And I leave your contact lenses on the bedside table
And I'm hoping you decide to come_back home
Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
Cause I've_been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love
Oh, you went running with my heart
And it's a long, long, long way back
And this right here, well it just ain't living
Oh, I want you to come_back
Well I've_been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
Well I've_been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love
My love

What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise the song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary
Have_yourself a merry_little Christmas.
Let your heart be light,
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight, hm.
Have_yourself a merry_little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away.
Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow,
Hang a shining star
Up on the highest bough,
And have yourself
A merry_little Christmas now
Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow, oh
Hang a shining star
Up on the highest bough
And have yourself a merry_little Christmas
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up
(And I want to...)
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up
(And I want to...)
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up
All my fear is running out
And I feel like I survived
'Cause I'm not the Earth and the rain doesn't wanna fall
Back when I thought that I had it all
All my feelings floodin' back for you
Am I gonna make you mine?
Can I really change your mind?
Will I get it right this time?
Will I get it right this time?
'Cause I want to believe
That I would keep fighting 'til the end
And I should have believed
That you were much more_than just a friend
A friend
You've_been away for far too long
Now I'm knockin' at your door
'Cause you're like the chain pullin' me where I shouldn't go
Back to the place where I'd never grow
Somethin' tells me I have changed for good
Am I gonna make you mine?
Can I really change your mind?
Will I get it right this time?
Will I get it right this time?
'Cause I want to believe
That I would keep fighting 'til the end
And I should have believed
That you were much more_than just a friend
A friend
Oh, won't you come_back for me?
(I want you)
(I, I want you)
Oh, won't you come_back for me?
(I want you)
(I, I want you)
'Cause I want to believe
That I would keep fighting 'til the end
And I should have believed
That you were much more_than just a friend
And I want to believe
That I was just fighting for a friend
And I should have believed
That we could have made it 'til the end
The end
I was only walking through your neighborhood
Saw you out_loud honey in the cold I stood
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are
I been getting used_to waking up with you
I been getting used_to waking up here
Anywhere I go there you are
Anywhere I go there you are
There you are
There you are
You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood
Since we met I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles_away but I still feel you
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go there you are
Late at night when you can't fall_asleep
I'll be lying right beside you counting sheep
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)
Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere)
There you are
There you are
You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood
Now listen here she said
Boy when you know you'll know
And I know
You're the fire and the flood
And I'll always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your hand is resting next to mine
Next to mine
You're the fire and the flood
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U Haul cross a one tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too_much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long_blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you
M O V E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've_been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look_at you
Legs and your hips
moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move
It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country_song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle_of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you
M O V E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've_been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look_at you
Legs and your hips
moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move
Let me talk to you
M O V E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C O M E
Come_on, I wanna see you
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look_at you
Legs and your hips

When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move

Once again it's Christmas
The Yuletide season's here
May the good Lord bless and keep you
Throughout the coming year
It's the time to be happy
Joyful, merry and gay
Let us all give thanks this Christmas
In our own very special way
The store windows, now,
are all glowing
With presents so shiny and new
And somewhere
there are children not knowing
What Santa, and reindeer, can do
Now the year has ended
It's time to start anew
So count your many blessings
And may all of your dreams come_true
The store windows now, are all glowing
With presents so shiny and new
And somewhere
there are children not knowing
What Santa, and reindeer, can do
Now the year has ended
It's time to start anew
So count your many blessings
And may all of your dreams come_true
This city's always moving
Nothing stays still
Somebody's always leaving
Somebody always will
There are airplanes
Taking off and landing
Lovers left behind
Without understanding
It's cold in Ohio
So I'm not going there
It's cold in Vostok station
In the middle_of nowhere
It's cold in New_York city
With that north_wind blowing through
It's cold in Ohio
But it's warm here next to you
I understand you're worrying
I know the feeling
Love is always shifting sand
It's not much to believe in
These_are the times we're living in
This_is the way of the world now
I'm not giving in and you
You don't know how
It's cold in Ohio
So I'm not going there
It's cold in Vostok station
In the middle_of nowhere
It's cold in New_York city
With that north_wind blowing through
It's cold in Ohio
But it's warm here next to you
Let the snow fall down
Let the wind blow through
It_doesn't matter now
It_doesn't matter now
It's cold in Ohio
So I'm not going there
It's cold in Vostok station
Out in the middle_of nowhere
It's cold in New_York city
With that north_wind blowing through
It's cold in Ohio
But it's warm here next to you
I love it when we're at a party in a down town crowd
Oh but I can hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone_else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one_more slow kiss, what are we waiting on
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background underneath the hardest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
On paper we go together
I know that we look the part
But almost never hangs on forever
I know I'm breaking your heart
So go on, say what you want to
I'm not gonna stop you
You can blame it all on me
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
Cause you're looking_for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Wish I could feel about you
The way you feel about me
But you can't make a heart say something
That it don't believe
So go on, hate me if you have to
I hate myself too
Cause as much as I want to be
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
Cause you're looking_for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Go on, hate me if you have to
I still care about you
As much as I want to be
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
Cause you're looking_for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide_open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
The happiness_I've known proves that it's right
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
You've_got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide_open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
Because you're_mine, I walk the line
Give me one_reason to stay_here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one_reason to stay_here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want to leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind
Baby I got your number, oh, and I know that you got mine
You know that I called you, I called too_many times
You can call me baby, you can call me anytime
You got to call me
Give me one_reason to stay_here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one_reason to stay_here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind
I don't want no_one to squeeze me, they might take away my life
I don't want no_one to squeeze me, they might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me, oh, and rock me through the night
This youthful_heart can love you, yes, and give you what you need
I said, This youthful_heart can love you, oh, and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy
Give me one_reason to stay_here
Yes and I'll turn right back around
Give me one_reason to stay_here
Ooh and I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one_reason why
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one_reason why I should stay
Said I told you that I loved you
And there_ain't no more to say
We where dancing
When she asked
Just like you used_to
She touched my hand
And held me
Just like you used_to
And so close, to my lips
The words came, that I almost
I almost called your name
Yes I almost called
I almost called your name
In so_many way's
You are both the same
The only difference, in the two
Is that I still love you
Yes I kiss't her, but
I almost called your name
Yes I kiss't her, but
I almost called your name
If he brings you happiness
Then I wish you all the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next_teardrop falls
Si te quiere de verdad
Y te da felicidad
Te deseo lo mas bueno pa'los dos
Pero si te hace llorar
A mi me puedes hablar
Y estare contigo cuando triste estas
I'll be there anytime
You need me by your side
To drive away every teardrop that you cried
And if he ever leaves you blue
Just remember, I love you
And I'll be there before the next_teardrop falls
And I'll be there before the next_teardrop falls
When you left this town,
with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align
The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind
From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Home at last
Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?
Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming in
Oh Angela spent your whole_life running away
Home at last
Home at last
Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knees, I belong, I believe
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
It's a lonely road full_of tired men
And you can see it in their faces
You'll be home in spring
I can wait 'til then
I heard you're on the big train
And oh this too shall pass
This loneliness won't last for long
I wasn't there to take his place
I was ten_thousand miles_away
So when you hear my voice
And when you say my name
May it never give you pain
'Cause I don't wanna go
But it's time to leave
You'll be on my mind and my destiny
And I won't fight in vain
I'll love you just the same, ooh
I couldn't know what's in your mind
But I saw the pictures
You're looking fine
And there was a time when I stood in line
For love, for love, for love
But I let you go, oh, I let you go
And he fell apart with his broken_heart
And this blood, this blood, this blood
Oh, it drains from my skin, it does
Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick
sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye to eye
and heart to heart
But maybe I'm just getting old
Used to work but now it don't
A long gone drive
You know the kind
where you take a turn
and you don't know why
But it clears your mind
a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That'll last a little longer
I could_use a love song
That takes me back
just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far
just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could_use
I could_use a love song
I wish I didn't know so_much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels_like a trick that isn't working
But I haven't lost all hope yet
Yeah it's hurting but it ain't dead
I could_use a love song
That takes me back
just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far
just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could_use
I could_use a love song
Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in
I could_use a love song
That takes me back
just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far
just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could_use
Yeah I could_use
I could_use a love song
Come on outside I got something to show ya
The sun is sinkin' and I'm dying to hold ya
There's a summertime southern breeze blowin' in the air tonight
Turn on the stereo, and leave the door open
Let's watch the moon and the fireflies glow in the sky
Forget the day and let it float away baby
Let's lose track of time
And just, sway put your head on my shoulder, let the music come and take us over
Let me pull you in a little_bit closer, baby close your eyes why don't we just
Stay right_here in the moment, I wanna feel ya movin' nice and slow yeah

So let me hold ya tight from left to right baby
We can sway put your head on my shoulder, let the music come and take us over

Yeah
It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
No, the sun is gonna rise, gonna rise
Shine down on another day
There will be tomorrow
Even_if you choose to leave
Cuz it don't matter to the sun no, no
It matters to me
It ain't gonna stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world just keeps spinning round, spinning round
Like it did the day before
Cuz to them it makes no difference
It just keeps on keeping time
Cuz it ain't gonna stop the world no
But it'll be the end of mine
So what can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
Why aren't you
Cuz it don't matter to the moon
If your not in my life
No the moon will just keep hanging round, hanging round
Like its just another night
Who find another place to shine
On some other lovers dreams
Cuz it don't matter to the moon no, no
It matters to me
Cuz it don't matter to the moon no, no
But it matters to me
Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she’s gonna be late
Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it’s a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan
You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day’s gone and the night’s_on fire
She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s_on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s_on fire
She’s a seat laid back, a boy’s dream
Drawin’ hearts in the window steam
She’s a gettin’ you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline
When you know what you’re headed to
What’s a red blooded boy to do
She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s_on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s_on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s_on fire
She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s_on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s_on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s_on fire
You try to play it cool but the night’s_on fire
Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday_morning Elvis
Singing Gospel it's a hell of a groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl you're put together perfectly
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There_ain't nobody
A do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth
Like cat daddy driving
A Caddy from Cali baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an_old can bottle by the Moon
Blackberry jam, finger licking
Off your hand flying out the window
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There_ain't nobody
There_ain't nobody
A do me like you
Do me like you
The way you move that body
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth
So smooth
Smooth, smooth
You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There_ain't nobody
There_ain't nobody
A do me like you
Do me like you
The way you move that body
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth
So smooth
Smooth, smooth
You so smooth
Smooth
When the sun rises silver
If it rises at all
Meet me there across the water
And we'll start an endless storm
Rain falls in love
We fall in love
Together we walk
the English winter
So caught_up in one another
Who_cares is we're under
thunders showers
The rain us ours
and we are lovers of
Heavy_weather
Come out lightning
tries to strike us
We might be frightened
but we won't run
We be so happy
if we were fearless
And in the darkness
we will become
Rain falls in love
We fall in love
Together we walk
the English winter
So caught_up in one another
Who_cares if we're
under thunders showers
The rain us ours
and we are lovers of
Heavy_weather
Heavy_weather heavy weather
Heavy_weather heavy weather
Heavy_weather heavy weather
Heavy_weather heavy weather
Together we walk
the English winter
So caught_up in one another
Who if we're under
thunder showers
The rain us ours
and we are lovers of
Together we walk
the English winter
So caught_up in one another
We're crazy for
under thunders over us
The rain us ours
and we are lovers of
Heavy_weather heavy weather
I'm right even when I'm wrong
I break things like hearts and iPhones
Taxi cab when it's raining
In the car with my friends, I'm Jay Z
Can't dance but I won't stop
In my little black_dress and hightops
Don't care but still get jealous
Without GPS, I'm helpless
But I'm not gonna stray
I'm such a beautiful mess
Who_cares what they say
I never listen anyway
In my head,_yeah I'm cool
Gonna keep making my own rules
So call me crazy
Dysfunctional, maybe
I don't_care, I'll show it
Cause I own it
Own_it, own it
Cause I own it
Own_it, own it
Oh, oh
I'm ambitious but don't like work
I write love songs, can't flirt
Awkward in conversation
But I'm Shakespeare when I'm texting, ha
Sweatpants but I'm still a lady
Trip and fall in public, gracefully
Wild, but I'm nerdy
I party hard 'til at_least 930
Who_cares what they say
I never listen anyway
In my head,_yeah I'm cool
Gonna keep making my own rules
So call me crazy
Dysfunctional, maybe
I don't_care, I'll show it
Cause I own it
Own_it, own it
Cause I own it
Own_it, own it
Oh, oh
Own your coolness
Own your crazy
Own your story in the making
Own your passion
Own your style
Own your stupid
Own your brave and
Own your wings and your mistakes
Own your style
Own your stupid
We're not gonna stress
We're all such a beautiful mess
Who_cares what they say
We never listen anyway
In our heads, yeah I'm cool
Gonna keep making our own rules
So call us crazy
Dysfunctional, maybe
We don't_care, we'll show it
Cause we own it
Own_it, own it
We own it
Own_it, own it
Oh, oh
We own it
Own_it, own it
We own it
Own_it, own it
Just own it
We come together here we go
Around the fire here we go
Flaming higher here we go
To my surprise a fever grows
Lamps will glimmer on the gloom
Prey on the light in the room
As we fill it to the brim
We say the words we take them in
Oh how the hills were laughing
Oh How the creeks they cried
Oh How the grass would cheer on
As we passed them by
Room for many room for few
Here in the dark I made for you
Oh why do I hear you and believe
That we come together to
make it sweet
Oh how the hills were laughing
Oh How the creeks they cried
Oh How the grass would cheer on
As we passed them by
I wanna buy you roses
'Cause the words are dead
Follow in the blindness
On the arrow head
'Cause the words are dead
And you know it
Yeah the words are dead
Lower them down
Didn't know if you could
Deny the dead
Leaving them in silence
On their mouldy bed
Oh I am numb
And over
Their kingdom come
Lower me down
They are dead they are dead
Oh don't cry for me
Oh don't cry for me
Oh don't cry for me
Oh don't you cry for me
Lower them down in the ground
Lower them down in the ground
They_say every sin will have
a thousand eyes
To guilty fools with guilty minds
But I most be cruel to be kind
Deep within a my head of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone could I be could I be
Oh how the birds forget to sing
Do they know where I have been
Oh how I will leave you there again
Deep within my head of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone could I be could I be
You are my only one
You are my only one
You are my lonely one
You are my only one
Oh for the trees did grow there
and the plants did spring
Oh for they know a lovers sin
Ain’t made of paper or of string
It’s cast into a head of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone
could I be of stone could I be could I be
Before cultivation of christmas trees
they were down on their knees in the wood
inspecting the trunk for good axing potential
and that's how they knew if they could
that's how they knew if they could
it's almost almost christmas
and you might, maybe you could
break a heart or_two now
and i think you should
i think you should
before mass production of fireplace stockings
families would make them from scratch
with patches and old scraps of blankets and clothing
it really didn't matter if they matched
it really didn't matter if they matched
it's almost almost christmas
and you might, maybe you could
break a heart or_two now
and i think you should
i think you should
it's almost almost christmas
and you might, maybe you could
break a heart or_two now
and i think you should
i think you should
All my friends say that they're happy that I'm moving on
First time that they've_seen me smile since you up and gone
But your memory_won't let me go
Pretty as a picture that you'd hang up on a wall
But she just can't compare to you and it really ain't her fault
I know that I should fall for her
Believe me girl I've tried
But your memory_won't let me
She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete_with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're_still the only place that feels_like home
Cause your memory_won't let me go
No your memory_won't let me
Sometimes when she's close to me I still smell your perfume
And everytime I'm holding her, I'm really holding you
And any man in his right mind would be all hers by now
But your memory_won't let me
She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete_with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're_still the only place that feels_like home
Cause your memory_won't let me go
Oh your memory_won't let me
I know that I should fall for her
Believe me girl I've tried
But your memory_won't let me
She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete_with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're_still the only place that feels_like home
Cause your memory_won't let me go
Oh your memory_won't let me go
No your memory_won't let me go
Won't let me
Oh your memory_won't let me go
Constant Muse
Is my mind at ease or am I jaded
Has the brightest color in me faded
Have the simplest things been complicated
In a song
I was just nineteen when all this started
I was sun burned skin and open hearted
I was hometown proud, tucked in, and parted
In a song
In my dreams I'm wide_awake
And I always have exactly what it takes
Oh, my constant muse
I have pinned my life on you
Chasing words and every mood
Into song
In my dreams I'm wide_awake
And I always have exactly what it takes
In my dreams I'm wide_awake
And I always know exactly what to say
Oh, my constant muse
I have pinned my life on you
Chasing words and every mood
Into song
Is my mind at ease or am I jaded
May God_bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come_true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever_young
Forever young, forever_young
May you stay forever_young
May you grow_up to be righteous
May you grow_up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever_young
Forever young, forever_young
May you stay forever_young
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
And may your song always be sung
May you stay forever_young
Forever young, forever_young
May you stay forever_young
2, 3, 4
I have called you children, I have called you son
What is there to answer if I'm the only one
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Still I must obey, still I must invite
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do
If there's any_other way, I'll do_anything for you
I was dressed embarrassment
I was dressed in wine
If you had a part_of me, will you take your time
Even_if I come_back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life
Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If you ever make a mess, I'll do_anything for you
I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father or if you haven't one
I'll do_anything for you, I'll do_anything for you
I'll do_anything for you, I'll do_anything for you
I did_everything for you, I did_everything for you
I did_everything for you, I did_everything for you
I did_everything for you, I did_everything for you
I did_everything for you, I did_everything for you
I grew_up in one hell of a family
You'd envy us alright
All three girls are
looking_for trouble
But we came home every night
I don't wanna wear
your floral dresses
And my lips won't be coloured
I don't want your diamond necklace
Your disapproval cuts through
I see the way you look_at me
You don't have to tell me
I'm growing older each passing day
But my heart still_remains
I bet you thought
I'd grow out of these habits
Forgive me for missing
I don't wanna wear
your floral dresses
And my lips won't be coloured
I don't want your diamond necklace
Your disapproval cuts through
'Cause I see the way you look_at me
I see the way you look_at me
You don't have to tell me
I'll be moving on
when I know I can
Got to find my balance
need that steady hand
ooooh
What's the reason
you rhyme
Always try to find meaning
It gets easier
easier with time
with time
give it time
When did it happen
You feed, and you know
that balance
How can I write
The need to know
security in your eyes
What's the reason
you rhyme
Always try to find meaning
It gets easier
easier with time
with time
give it time
Give it time
Just give it time
I know you'll be alright x2
Just give it time x4
give it time give it time x3
give it time
just give it time
Is there relief
For tender headed hearts
We'll find reprieve
When from this earth we part
Na na_na na_na na_na na_na
The sky seems clear
Devoured with closed eyes
The end draws near
Your body severs ties
Na na_na na_na na_na na_na
Been waiting_for
This moment
For too long to regret
You let go
Your spirit flows
Your troubles
Ascend
Na na_na na_na na_na na_na
Lonely lonely_lonely lonely_lonely world
Casts a shadow on the shallow love it hurls
To the feet of swine it need not cast its pearls
Lonely lonely_lonely lonely_lonely world
And the sound of the void
Flows through your body
Undestroyed
And the sound of your voice
Flows from your body
White as noise
Ahh
And the void speaks to you
In ways nobody
Speaks to you
And that voice fills the air
Fog in the morning
Going nowhere
Ahh
Lonely lonely_lonely face under a veil
After all the laughter, emptiness prevails
Born into this world with no consent or choice
Lonely lonely_lonely lonely_lonely lonely
Ahh
Are you sitting at home all alone
trying to fall_asleep
Are you staring a hole
through your phone
praying that it rings
Are you watching a movie that
you've seen a thousand times
Or_maybe playing some Mayer
getting lost in your favorite lines
Well if you're anything like me
You just might be
doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl I confess
I lied when I said
I'm leaving and not coming back
Might be the whiskey
or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your_face
In my_brain dial it up
everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light
with a Marlboro Light on your_lips
Does the smoke in your mirror
get clearer without my kiss
Are you changing the station
replacing our favorite_songs
Well maybe it's a mistake
hit the brakes I'm moving on
Well if you're anything like me
You just might be
doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl I confess
I lied when I said
I'm leaving and not coming back
Might be the whiskey
or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your_face
In my_brain dial it up
everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick_up when I call
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl I confess
I lied when I said
I'm leaving and not coming back
Might be the whiskey
or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your_face
In my_brain dial it up
everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number
away away away
Yeah I'm still one number away
Let’s admit
We don’t have much time
One_more chance
Until we must stop tryin’
Look_at me
See the fear in my eyes
It’s too_soon
But I’m_afraid this is goodbye
Don’t want us to part
But we’ll just have to
and hope for a new start
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new_beginning
I would do_anything to be
by your side
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new_beginning
I would do_anything
to see you again
Don’t let it be goodbye
Time stands still
When I know I can’t reach you
Don’t want us to part
But we’ll just have to
and hope for a new start
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new_beginning
I would do_anything to be
by your side
We’ll leave it all behind
for a new_beginning
I would do_anything
to see you again
Don’t let it be goodbye
Some don't last the way they should
Some make you feel good for a little while
And then you throw 'em away
Some are up on a shelf for some other day
Some are high dollar, some ain't worth a dime
But you keep 'em anyway
Everybody's looking_for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
Strut down that street tonight
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking_for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high heel, high top, pump 'em_up, flip flop
Heads up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patten leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size
You're stepping on cracks, you're breaking your back
You're working so damn hard just to make it look easy
Come dance with me 'cause dancings free
Let me sweep you right off your feet
Whatever your style is, girl, that's what mine is
I could go good with your eyes
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
Strut down that street tonight
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking_for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high heel, high top, pump 'em_up, flip flop
Heads up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patten leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size
Yeah, everybody's looking_for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
Strut down that street tonight
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking_for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high heel, high top, pump 'em_up, flip flop
Heads up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patten leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size
Try me on for size, try me on for size
Never know unless you try
[Verse_1]
You're better_than the movies
I know how it ends, but I can't stop
Watching you ruin me like this
I heard you slip out the door
Heard you backin' out the drive at 10 out to 4
I bet your kiss on my lips
Knowin' it's the last one that I'll get
[Chorus]
When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh,_oh, oh
Oh,_oh, oh
[Verse_2]
You're puttin' up pictures
You know, the ones I'm supposed to be in
You say I'll miss you
Then I never hear from you again
You got it down to an art
You watch me fall and disappear in the dark, yeah
You're a silent assassin, I can't stop it once it happens
[Chorus]
When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh,_oh, oh
Oh,_oh, oh
[Bridge]
Why you gotta run, why you gotta run?
Why you gotta run, why you gotta run?
[Chorus]
When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh,_oh, oh
Oh,_oh, oh
[Outro]
Why you gotta be a heartbreaker, heartbreaker?
You're so good at breaking my heart
Yeah it's true, all you
You little heartbreaker
Oh, you little heartbreaker
You gotta be, gotta be, gotta be
So good at breaking my heart
All you, that's what you do
It's funny_how you sound as if you're right next_door when you're really half a world away
I just can't seem to find the words I'm looking_for to say the things that I want to say
I can't remember when I felt so close to you, it's almost more_than I can bear
And though I seem a half a million miles from you, you are in my heart and living there
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same_old sun up in the sky
And your voice in my ear is like heaven to me like the breezes here in old Shanghai
There are lovers who walk hand in hand in the park and lovers who walk all alone
There are lovers who lie unafraid in the dark and lovers who long for home
Oh, I couldn't leave you even if I wanted to, you're in my dreams and always near
And especially when I sing the songs I wrote for you, you are in my heart and living there
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same_old sun up in the sky
And your_face in my dreams is like heaven to me just like the breezes here in old Shanghai
Shanghai breezes, cool and clearing, evening's sweet caress
Shanghai breezes, soft and gentle, remind me of your tenderness
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same_old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me, like the breezes here in old Shanghai
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see, it's the same_old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me, like the breezes here in old Shanghai
Just like the breezes here in old Shanghai
Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small_town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small_town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men
And I believe to my soul that inside every man, there's the feminine
And inside every lady, there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each_other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy, don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each_other
What do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady, there's a cowboy that wants to come out
And inside every cowboy, there's a lady that'd love to slip out
When I call you up
Can I call you love
I won’t keep in touch
That’s_what I’m_afraid of
Isn’t this some_shit
Let’s call it what it is
I can’t be your bitch
That’s_what I’m_afraid of
Waiting_here since_Sunday but you never say the word_(stay)
Leaving_here for London_but I’ll see you on the first_(hey)
Scout’s_honor babe
I’m_honest babe
A_promise is a promise_babe
You told me that you wanted me
I told you you were_brave
What was that you said
Swear_she never really means it
Guess_it’s over time of death
For a 100_different reasons
Yeah_that’s not the way it works_(babe)
I love you but it hurts_(damn)
It’s over and it’s not
I guess_it’s overtime_then
I guess_it’s overtime_then
Call you you pick_up
You wanted to say I love you
But I’m not the one you love
And that’s what I’m_afraid of
Oh shit this is light rock
Yeah it’s her number one
Tell you as I turn it up
At the moment
It’s my favorite
It’s my favorite
Waiting_here since_Sunday but you never say the word_(stay)
Leaving_here for London_but I’ll see you on the first_(hey)
Scout’s_honor babe
I’m_honest babe
A_promise is a promise_babe
You told me that you wanted me
I told you you were_brave
What was that you said
Swear_she never really means it
Guess_it’s over time of death
For a 100_different reasons
Yeah_that’s not the way it works_(babe)
I love you but it hurts_(damn)
It’s over and it’s not
I guess_it’s overtime_then
I guess_it’s overtime_then
I guess_it’s overtime
I guess_it’s overtime_then
I guess_it’s overtime
I guess_it’s overtime_then
Waiting_here since_Sunday but you never say the word_(stay)
Leaving_here for London_but I’ll see you on the first_(hey)
Scout’s_honor babe
I’m_honest babe
A_promise is a promise_babe
You told me that you wanted me
I told you you were_brave
Funny how it disappears
The second you give in
When the world comes to terms with the way that it spins
Funny how you rearrange
How your mind begins to change
Hold yourself a little tighter in the arms of your old age
And when nothing_else is working
And the air is getting thin
I will hold on like the first_time
Feel the pulse beneath my skin
I can feel it, know it’s true
I can't heal what I hold on to
I wish I could make the promise
I am this and nothing more
But there’s a holiness in finding I was something else before
And I held my head in water
Like I wasn’t scared to drown
Like I knew when it was over
I'd be finished looking down
And am I someone you believe in
Can I trust what I can see
I’m still alive and I am breathing
You won’t take the rest_of me
I can feel it I know it's true
I can’t heal what I hold_onto
Give me a minute
I need another quiet day
My hands are shaking in the worst way
Give me a minute or_two
Maybe a year would be enough
I’m still deciding if it’s worth it for all this stuff
I can feel it, know it’s true
I can't heal what I hold on to
